               ...pianist. A classical pianist. She 
               plays the piano. She's a
 
               
               brilliant woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the
 
               
               
               Waldstein Sonata! The Waldstein!

               We did a crossword puzzle together, 
               in bed. It was the most fun
 
               
               I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my life!

               
               Y'know?

               
               Jerry enters

               
                             JERRY
               Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I was telling you about Noel.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (sarcastically) Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly 
               funny...
 
               
                             JERRY
               All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What, you think I'm going to repeat 
               the whole thing now?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I know, you told me you like her, everything 
               is going good.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No everything is not going good. I'm 
               very uncomfortable. I have
 
               
               no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. Once in
 
               
               
               my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand 
               at
 
               
               all. She has the hand; I have no hand...

               
                             GEORGE
               How do I get the hand?

               
                             JERRY
               We all want the hand. Hand is tough 
               to get. You gotta get the
 
               
               hand right from the opening.

               
                             GEORGE
               She's playing a recital this week at 
               the McBierney School. You wanna hear 
               her play? I got two extra tickets, you 
               and Elaine could go...
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Then afterwards maybe we could all go 
               out together. Y'know she'll
 
               
               see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as 
               myself.
 
               
               Maybe I can get some hand that way.

               Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!

               
                             GEORGE
               With all due respect, I don't think 
               so...
 
               
                             JERRY
               That smells good, what is that?

               
                             KRAMER
               The beach!

               
                             JERRY
               The beach?

               
                             GEORGE
               What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees 
               out!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You joined the Polar Bears?!

               
                             GEORGE
               What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' 
               in the winter. They're terrific, I just 
               took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! 
               It's invigorating....
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah... So's shock therapy.

               
                             JERRY
               (with glee) What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at 
               the Flea Market.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

               
                             JERRY
               You don't know?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, I-I-I know... (retreats back to 
               his Chinese take out) I know...
 
               
                             JERRY
               You think they have fleas there, don't 
               you?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No...

               
                             JERRY
               Yes you do, Biff. You've never been 
               to a Flea Market, and you
 
               
               think they have fleas there.

               
                             GEORGE
               All right, I think they have fleas there. 
               So what...
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I don't know how anyone does this. It 
               must be so nerve racking...
 
               
               How do they warm up their fingers?

               
                             JERRY
               They have a piano backstage they warm 
               up on.
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               No, we would have heard it.

               
                             JERRY
               What, do you think they just crack their 
               knuckles and come out?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I told her we'd all go out afterwards, 
               okay? And don't applaud
 
               
               when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.

               
                             JERRY
               (quickly whispering) I resent that you 
               said that! That's
 
               
               directed at me, isn't it?!

               
               A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.

               
                             JERRY
               Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             STEVE
               Something I said? (no response) It's 
               John... Mollika.
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               Oh, oh, John... Oh, hi John... Hi...
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               What're you doing down here?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry 
               put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I
 
               
               
               started laughing.

               
                             MOLLIKA
               Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke 
               up.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               We did. We're just hanging out.

               
                             MOLLIKA
               REally. ... You really look great.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends 
               with Richie Appel?
 
               
                             MOLLIKA
               Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in 
               L. A. for a few years. He
 
               
               just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs.
 
               
               
               I don't know what to do for the guy.

               
                             ELAINE
               Have you thought about an intervention?
 
               
               
                             MOLLIKA
               What's that?

               
                             ELAINE
               You get all his friends in a room, They 
               confront himm to try to get
 
               
               him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.

               
                             MOLLIKA
               He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except 
               of course Jerry. He'd listen to
 
               
               Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
 
               
               
               Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.

               
               Outside Noel's dressing room

               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!

               
                             GEORGE
               What did you put the Pez dispenser on 
               her leg for in the first
 
               
               place?

               
                             JERRY
               I dunno, it was an impulse.

               
                             GEORGE
               What kind of a sick impulse does that??
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How could I know she would start to 
               laugh?
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am!

               
                             JERRY
               Can we just go in already?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are we gonna tell her?

               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, don't say a word. If she thinks 
               my friends are jerks, then
 
               
               I'm a jerk...

               
                             ELAINELAINE
               (To Jerry) Oh, remind me to talk to 
               you about something later.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What about?

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I know, but I'm distracted now.

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you? A baby!? All right. Tell 
               her.
 
               
               E When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.

               
                             JERRY
               Really John Mollika, they guy that used 
               to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's 
               he doing?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               He's good.

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, can we cut to the chase?

               
                             JERRY
               "Cut to the chase"?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah...

               
                             JERRY
               What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?

               
                             GEORGE
               A lot of people say it.

               
                             JERRY
               I would lose that.

               
                             GEORGE
               (Accusingly) What's that?

               
                             JERRY
               "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood 
               expression!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (Realizing full well it isn't) ...Yes 
               it is.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Anyway ... So John told me that Richie 
               is in town from
 
               
               Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told

               
               him that he should do an intervention.

               
                             JERRY
               Really, an intervention ...

               
                             GEORGE
               Y'know people, we got a situation over 
               here!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, but he want's you to be a part 
               of it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Me? Why me?

               
                             ELAINE
               'Cause Richie really respects you and 
               he would listen to you.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Y'know these things are really hard 
               to load...
 
               
                             GEORGE
               All right, OK, I'm goin' in.

               
                             JERRY
               We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               All right.

               
               (They Enter)

               
                             GEORGE
               Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.

               
                             NOEL
               No..

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and 
               Jerry, ... Noel
 
               
                             JERRY
               You play a Hell of a piano.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I was really moved, really moved.
 
               
               
                             NOEL
               Well didn't you hear that person laughing? 
               I couldn't play. I was
 
               
               humiliated...

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you.

               
                             NOEL
               Well then, what was she laughing at?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Pez?

               
                             NOEL
               Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Me, uh, uh, no, ...

               
                             JERRY
               Anyone who would laugh at a recital 
               is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. 
               I mean only a sick twisted mind could 
               be that rude and ignorant.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe some mental defective put something 
               stupid on her leg.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Even if this so called mental defective 
               did put something on her leg she's still 
               the one who laughed.
 
               
                             NOEL
               I'll never forget that laugh for the 
               rest of my life. (exits)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sure she would apologize if she 
               could. Probably somebody is holding 
               her back against every fibre in her 
               being.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               If she want's to continue to have a 
               fibre of her being she'll be very careful 
               (hitting each other)
 
               
               (Noel enters)

               
                             GEORGE
               All right, so are you ready, so we'll 
               go out and get something to eat.
 
               
                             NOEL
               I don't feel like it tonight.

               
                             JERRY
               We'll be outside

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah

               
                             JERRY
               It was nice meeting you By the way, 
               How do you warm up your fingers before 
               you play?
 
               
                             N
               I just crack my knuckles.

               
                             GEORGE
               We'll have a good time

               
                             N
               I don't feel like it

               
                             GEORGE
               Ah, come on

               
                             N
               I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!

               
                             GEORGE
               Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. 
               I'll call you and we'll talk on the 
               phone. A telephone communiqué. Every 
               thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. (exits)

                             JERRY
               You know I thing Kramer might have been 
               responsible for getting Richie involved 
               with drugs in the first place.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What? How?

               
                             JERRY
               A few years ago the comedy club had 
               a softball team. Kramer was our first 
               baseman You couldn't get anything by 
               him It was unbelievable.
 
               
               Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. 
               So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade 
               on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead 
               and does it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               So? What happened?

               
                             JERRY
               What happened? The guy was like 67 years 
               old, it was freezing out, he caught 
               a cold, got pneumonia,
 
               
               and a month later he was dead.

               
                             ELAINE
               Shut up!

               
                             JERRY
               All the comedians were happy. He was 
               one of these club owners nobodu liked 
               anyway. But Richie was never the same.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Whar about Kramer?

               
                             JERRY
               He's the same!

               
               (Jerry on phone at home)

               
                             JERRY
               Are you sure you want me John. I have 
               spoken to Richie in two years. I don't 
               have a good apartment for
 
               
               an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. 
               All right All right. Goodbye.
 
               
               (to Kramer) Remember Ricie Appel?

               
                             KRAMER
               (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told 
               to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty 
               Benson?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing 
               some kind of intervention for him. We're 
               having it here.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Can I get in on that?

               
                             JERRY
               What do you think? It's like a poker 
               game?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Is Elaine going?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, I knew him as well as she did.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, but John invited her.

               
                             KRAMER
               So what are you saying, you don't want 
               me to intervene?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, intervene, go intervene all you 
               want. I am just afraid you might be 
               interfering while we're intervening.

                             JERRY
               Stop smelling your arm.

               
                             KRAMER
               You know I got a great idea for a cologne. 
               The Beach. You spray it on and you smell 
               like you just
 
               
               came home from the beach

               
                             JERRY
               Hum, a cologne that smells like the 
               beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, 
               "That's not a bad idea."
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Tell me about it!

               
                             JERRY
               Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he 
               works in the marketing department at 
               Calvin Klein.
 
               
               In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.

                             GEORGE
               Well it's over. It's definitely over.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               She broke up with you?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, but I can tell she's going to. I 
               can sense it. We had this terrible phone 
               conversation.
 
               
               I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of 
               things to talk about.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What was on the list?

               
                             GEORGE
               Let's see, How I'm very good at going 
               in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum 
               a more popular drink,
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,

               
                             GEORGE
               Anyway there was all this tension. I 
               asked her if she wanted to go out to 
               dinner and she said

               What's wrong with lunch?

               
                             GEORGE
               Lunch is fine at the beginning then 
               you move on to dinner. you don't move 
               back to lunch. It's like being demoted.

                             KRAMER
               You break up with her. You reverse everything 
               that way.

               A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible 
               idea. I got nothing to lose.
 
               
               We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go 
               out with some

               Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that

                             GEORGE
               It's George

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
 
               
               
                             GUY
               If you don't go out with me it's because 
               I'm a bar tender.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Look, I don't think this is appropriate 
               right now.
 
               
                             GUY
               Is it because I have a tissue in my 
               nose?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You're getting warm.

               
               George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful)

               
                             GEORGE
               We just came from Chadway's(?) What's 
               going on.
 
               
                             JERRY
               We're having the intervention for Richie.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, right, right, the intervention. 
               Should we leave?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, uh..

               
                             NOEL
               (happily) Elaine, hi.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, hi Noel

               
               (Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them)

               
                             JERRY
               Well, you're looking well.

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry, let me tell you something, "A 
               man without hand is not a man."
 
               
               I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank 
               Kramer.
 
               
                             STEVE
               Even if I were dragged through manure 
               I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               You think so?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't think so I know so, Kramer, 
               come here I got to talk to you
 
               
                             OLD MAN
               The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch 
               only the female has it. The male has 
               pouch envy.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (Chuckles)

               
               Old GUY; at least give me a pocket.

               
                             ELAINE
               (laughs)

               
               Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven

               
                             NOEL
               That laugh. That's the laugh. That's 
               it. You're the one.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, no. It was an accident. It really 
               wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
 
               
               Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg.

               
                             NOEL
               You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during 
               my recital?.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know she would laugh.

               
                             NOEL
               You lied to me George, you lied to me.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? 
               ... Where are you going?
 
               
                             NOEL
               I ... am breaking up ... with you!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You can't break up with me. I've got 
               hand.
 
               
                             NOEL
               And you're going to need it.

               
               Noel exits, George chases her

               
               Richie and John enter

               
                             JERRY
               Hey Richie

               
                             RICHIE
               So what's going on?

               
               Later

               
                             JERRY
               It was pretty ugly from the get go. 
               he's not listening, He's hostile, he's
 
               
               
               talking back.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't do these puzzles.

               
                             JERRY
               So he starts to get up He spots the 
               Pez dispenser on the coffee table
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Ah ah Pez dispenser.

               
                             JERRY
               He picks it up - he stares at it - It's 
               like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's
 
               
               
               telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the 
               car with his father, and
 
               
               his father was trying to load one of them

               
                             GEORGE
               Well they're hard to load.

               
                             JERRY
               Tell me something I don't know. So as 
               the father's trying to load it he loses 
               control
 
               
               of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's 
               hurt but Pez is all
 
               
               over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond 
               recognition.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Poor kid.

               
                             JERRY
               So as he's telling the story he starts 
               crying.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What did you do?

               
                             JERRY
               What do you think? I gave him my Pez 
               dispenser.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wow

               
                             JERRY
               Two hours later he checks into Smither's 
               clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.
 
               
               
               He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating 
               them like there's no tomorrow.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What's a three letter word for candy?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I can't do those things.

               
               
               
               
                            THE END
