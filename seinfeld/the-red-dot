               I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit 
               of a scary place to work. I don't know 
               how you feel about it. You want to be 
               standing there having people comming 
               in all day going "I need knives. I need 
               more knives. Do you have any bigger 
               knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, 
               long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in 
               the market for. I like them really sharp. 
               Do you have one with hooks and gouges 
               like blades and kind of serrated? That's 
               the kind of knife I'm looking for. I 
               need one I can throw. I need another 
               one I can just hack away with. Do you 
               have anything like that?

               At a party

               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking 
               about.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Like you do.

               
                             JERRY
               Well what do you think? They put the 
               statue on a giant raft and a tugboat 
               pulled it all the way from France?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What do you think? The brought it over 
               in pieces and screwed it together like 
               a coffee table?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas 
               party isn't it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why did France give that to us anyway?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It was a gift.

               
                             GEORGE
               So countries just exchange gifts like 
               that?
 
               
                             JERRY
               If they like each other.

               
                             GEORGE
               There's Elaine.

               
                             JERRY
               See that guy he's talking with? That's 
               her new boyfriend.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Really? They work here in the office?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. They're having a little fling 
               so don't say anything.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like 
               I've got nothing better to talk about.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Really?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two 
               years.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               "Off the wagon"?

               
                             JERRY
               I think it's off the wagon.

               
                             GEORGE
               I think it's "on the wagon".

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding 
               out a present)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my 
               watch! (pushing Jerry)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey keep your hands to yourself if you 
               know what's good for you.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Where did you find it?

               
                             JERRY
               Under the sofa cushion.

               
                             ELAINE
               And you stopped by just to give it to 
               me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's your Christmas present.

               
                             ELAINE
               I though I'd never find it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well today's your lucky day.

               
                             ELAINE
               No. Today's *your* lucky day.

               
                             GEORGE
               It will be my first one.

               
                             ELAINE
               You want to work here?

               
                             GEORGE
               Huh?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah one of the readers left and there's 
               a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and 
               this is George.
 
               
                             DICK
               Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               "The guy?"

               
                             ELAINE
               (softly to Dick) Dick.

               
                             GEORGE
               How can you just get it?

               
                             ELAINE
               My boss told me to find someone. I'm 
               in charge of it. All you have to do 
               is meet him. Come on. Come on, come 
               on, here hold my drink.

               Cranberry juice?

               
                             ELAINE
               And vodka.

               
                             DICK
               I got the cranberry juice.

               
                             DICK
               So... you're Jerry.

                             BOSS
               So have you ever done this kind of work 
               before?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, you know, book reports. That kind 
               of stuff.
 
               
                             BOSS
               How do you read?

                             BOSS
               Mike Lubika?

               He's a sports writer for the daily news. 
               I find him very insightful...
 
               
                             BOSS
               No, no, no. I mean authors.

               
                             GEORGE
               Lot of good ones. I don't even want 
               to mention anyone because I'm afraid 
               I'm going to leave somebody out.
 
               
                             BOSS

               Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
 
               
               
                             BOSS
               Art Vandelay?

               
                             GEORGE
               He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the 
               village.
 
               
                             BOSS
               What has he written?

               
                             GEORGE
               Venetian Blinds.

               
                             DICK
               (picking up the drink) I've got new 
               for you. I'm funnier than you are.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Why don't get we together New Years 
               day and watch some football.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Where's my drink?

               
                             JERRY
               There. (turns to George) So, how did 
               it go?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I think he was impressed.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up 
               yours.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. 
               I told you to hold it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I 
               thought you meant hold it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               One drink like that and he could fall 
               right off the wagon.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Told you.

               
               At a clothing store.

               
                             JERRY
               I never feel comfortable in the women's 
               department. I feel like I'm just a *little* 
               too close to trying on a dress.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Do I really have to buy her something?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Hey the woman got you a job. The least 
               you could do is buy her a gift. How 
               about this?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What is that? Is that cashmere?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. She would love cashmere.

               
                             GEORGE
               Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one 
               person in the world that doesn't like 
               cashmere. It's too expensive.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked 
               down from 600.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wow. Excuse me, Miss?

               
                             WOMAN
               Yes?

               
                             GEORGE
               How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
 
               
               
                             WOMAN
               (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is 
               why.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What? I don't see anything.

               
                             WOMAN
               See this red dot?

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's 
               not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
 
               
               
                             WOMAN
               There's no exchanges on this.

               
                             GEORGE
               You think she would care about the red 
               dot?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's hard to say.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't even think she'd notice it. 
               Can you see it?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well I can see it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, but you know where it is.

               
                             JERRY
               Well what do you want me to do? Not 
               look at it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Pretend you didn't know it was there. 
               Can you see it?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's hard to pretend because I know 
               where it is.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well just take an overview. Can't you 
               just take an overview?
 
               
                             JERRY
               You want me to take an overview?

               
                             GEORGE
               Please.

               
                             JERRY
               I see a very cheap man holding a sweater 
               trying to get away with something. That's 
               my overview.
 
               
               At Jerry's apartment.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah so?

               
                             ELAINE
               He's acting very strangely. I think 
               he started drinking again.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh boy, can you smell it?

               
                             ELAINE
               No. I can't smell it.

               
                             JERRY
               Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't 
               been drinking.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You don't always smell someone from 
               a drink.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yes you do.

               
                             ELAINE
               What about one drink? Would you smell 
               it from one drink?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yes you would.

               
               Kramer enters

               
                             JERRY
               I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Okay.

               
                             JERRY
               Would you take a drink and let us smell 
               you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You can smell me without the drink.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might 
               be drinking but I can't smell it.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Okay, well what am I drinking? What 
               do you got?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave 
               me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for 
               two years. I've been using it as a paint 
               thinner.
 
               
               Kramer drinks.

               
                             KRAMER
               All right.

               
               Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't smell anything.

               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
 
               
               
               Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               (over the speaker) It's George.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             KRAMER
               That is *damn* good scotch. I could 
               do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, 
               boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. 
               And afterwords you don't even smell. 
               That's right folks. I just had three 
               shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. 
               Imagine, you can walk around drunk all 
               day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, 
               no-tell scotch.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hello everybody.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey. (snuggling really close to George) 
               I'm going to tell you what I think. 
               I know you don't care what I think, 
               but I'm going to tell you. I think that 
               you are terrific.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (uncomfortablly) Thank you.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey what's that?

               
                             GEORGE
               It's an early Christmas present.

               
                             ELAINE
               Christmas present? For who?

               
                             GEORGE
               For you.

               
                             ELAINE
               *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Say you got a big job interview, and 
               you're a little nervous. Well throw 
               back a couple shots of Hennigans and 
               you'll be as loose as a goose and ready 
               to roll in no time. And because it's 
               odorless, why, it will be our little 
               secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer. Yeah that'll do.

               
                             ELAINE
               (opening the present) Oh George, this 
               is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it's cashmere.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I love cashmere.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well who doesn't.

               
                             ELAINE
               My, George this must have cost a fortune.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Ahh, money.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, how could you let him spend so 
               much money?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He 
               just wants to make people happy.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               George, this is one of the nicest things 
               anyone has ever given me.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well good, good. Take it off you're 
               going to wear it out already. It's for 
               special occasions this thing.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What's that red dot on your sweater?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               Just take it off. I'm getting hot just 
               looking at it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.

               
                             GEORGE
               What red dot? What are you talking about? 
               Jerry come here for a second. Do you 
               see anything here?
 
               
                             JERRY
               (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, 
               I don't know.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What don't you know?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well do you see it or don't you?

               
                             JERRY
               Ahem. Say that again?

               
                             ELAINE
               Do you see it or don't you?

               
                             JERRY
               Do I see it... or don't I? That's the 
               question.
 
               
               Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. 
               He comes back groggy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Now what did you ask me again.

               
               Kramer is snoring.

               
               (Commercial)

               
               (Whew, Jerry is saved by the bell.)

               
               At the office. Elaine is walking by.

               
                             ELAINE
               You're still here. You're a dynamo.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't believe I get paid for this.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I'll see you tomorrow.

               
               Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady 
               comes by.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               How you doing?

               
                             CLEANING LADY
               Hello.

               
               The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the 
               lady as she is cleaning.
 
               
               At Monk's.

               
                             JERRY
               You had sex with the cleaning woman 
               on your desk? Who are you, how did you 
               do that?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hennigans. I was there sitting in the 
               office and the cleaning woman comes 
               in. I've always been attracted to cleaning 
               women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to 
               them too.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why is that?

               
                             JERRY
               It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, 
               back and forth, her hips swivelling, 
               her breasts, uh... (trying to think 
               of a word)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Convulsing?

               
                             GEORGE
               Convulsing?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You don't drink.

               
                             GEORGE
               I know but I couldn't think of anything 
               else to say to her.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So you started drinking.

               
                             GEORGE
               So we started drinking, and I'll tell 
               you I don't know if it was the alcohol 
               or the ammonia, but the next think I 
               knew she was mopping the floor with 
               me.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So how was it?

               
                             GEORGE
               Well the sex was okay, but I threw up 
               from the Hennigans.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
 
               
               
               At Jerry's apartment.

               
                             ELAINE
               Dick was fired.

               
                             JERRY
               You mean to tell me if I had put that 
               drink six inches over to the right, 
               and none of this would have happened.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd 
               you put the drink down at all?
 
               
                             JERRY
               What are you saying?

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm not saying anything.

               
                             JERRY
               You're saying something.

               
                             ELAINE
               What could I be saying?

               
                             JERRY
               Well you're not saying nothing you must 
               be saying something.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               If I was saying something I would have 
               said it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well why don't you say it?

               
                             ELAINE
               I said it.

               
                             JERRY
               What did you say?

               
                             ELAINE
               Nothing. It's exhausting being with 
               you.
 
               
               Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah?

               
                             GEORGE
               (over the speaker) It's George.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, let me ask you something something. 
               Did George buy that sweater knowing 
               the red dot was on it because it was 
               cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, 
               you just gave me the answer.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No I didn't.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your 
               expression.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't have an expression. I have 
               a deviated septum. I have to open my 
               mouth sometimes to breathe.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               How much did he save?

               
                             JERRY
               Frankly I am shocked that you would 
               ask such a question (Elaine sticking 
               out her tongue like she isn't buying 
               a word of it) of me, that you would 
               think - the only surprise is how you 
               could even think of that. That's what 
               you were seeing.
 
               
               Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.

               
                             GEORGE
               I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing 
               lady is turning the screws on me. She's 
               pushing for this whole relationship 
               thing. She keeps calling me, threatening 
               to go to the boss with this thing, I 
               could lose my job, I gotta do something 
               to keep her quiet.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise 
               to whole red dot thing. She's asking 
               me all kinds of questions.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Did you tell her anything?

               
                             JERRY
               No.

               
                             GEORGE
               Do you swear?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh you told her didn't you.

               
                             JERRY
               No.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey George, did you buy that sweater 
               knowing that red dot was on it because 
               you could get it at a discount?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What? Did I what?

               
                             ELAINE
               You did didn't you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. 
               Here I go out in the spirit of the season 
               (Elaine looking like she's not buying 
               a word of it) and spend all my savings 
               to buy you the most beautiful Christmas 
               sweater I have ever seen to show my 
               appreciation to you at Christmas and 
               this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well Jerry told me that you did.

               
                             GEORGE
               You told her? How could you tell her? 
               I told you not to say anything.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. 
               She tricked you.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 
               temperature when I bought that sweater. 
               I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots 
               everywhere. I thought everything in 
               the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
               distinguish one red dot from another. 
               I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. 
               I haven't worked for a really long time. 
               (Jerry is standing right behind George. 
               Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts 
               fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have 
               no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. 
               It's just a little red dot.
 
               
               At the office.

               
                             GEORGE
               This is for you.

               
                             LADY
               Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? 
               Oh I knew you cared for me.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               As you care for me. Which is why it 
               is very important that you never breathe 
               a word of this to anyone about the... 
               you know. What, with Clarence Thomas 
               and everything.
 
               
                             LADY
               Okay, okay, can I open it now?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes of course go ahead. My guess is 
               you're going to like this very much.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               Oh! Is that cashmere?

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it's cashemere.

               
                             LADY
               A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Just a little something for Christmas.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               When I was a little girl in Panama, 
               a rich American came to our town and 
               he was wearing the softest most beautiful 
               sweater. I said to him, "what do you 
               call this most beautiful fabric?", and 
               he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated 
               the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked 
               if I could have it, and he said "No. 
               Get away from me." Then he started walk 
               away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming 
               for him to give me the sweater and he 
               dragged me through the street. And then 
               he kicked at me with the other foot 
               and threw some change at me. Oh, but 
               I didn't want the change Georgie. I 
               wanted the cashmere.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I had a feeling you would like it. No, 
               don't try it on now, try it on later.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               (noticing the dot) What's this?

               
               At the comedy club.

               
                             JERRY
               I was in the men's room the other day 
               and they had the hand blower, instead 
               of the paper towels, you know this thing. 
               I like the hand blower I have to say. 
               It takes a little bit longer, but I 
               feel when you're in a room with a revolting 
               stench you want to spend as much time 
               as you can.
 
               
                             DICK
               The only stench is comming from you.
 
               
               
                             AUDIENCE
               Oooooh.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, wait a second, I believe we have 
               a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey 
               Dick I don't know what your problem 
               is. It's not my fault you're back on 
               the wagon.
 
               
                             DICK
               It's off the wagon.

               
                             JERRY
               In the old days how do you think they 
               got the alcohol from town to town?
 
               
               
                             DICK
               I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               On the wagon. Don't you think they broke 
               into a couple of those bottles along 
               the way?
 
               
                             DICK
               You can't drink on a wagon it would 
               be too bumpy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               They had smooth trails. What about the 
               Cumberland Gap?
 
               
                             DICK
               What the hell do you know about wagons?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I know enough not to get on them.

               
               In the boss' office.

               
                             BOSS
               I'm going to get right to the point. 
               It has come to my attention that you 
               and the cleaning woman have engaged 
               in sexual intercourse on the desk in 
               your office. Is that correct?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Who said that?

               
                             BOSS
               She did.

               
                             GEORGE
               Was that wrong? Should I have not done 
               that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance 
               on this thing because if anyone had 
               said anything to me at all when I first 
               started here that that sort of thing 
               was frouned upon, you know, cause I've 
               worked in a lot of offices and I tell 
               you peope do that all the time.
 
               
                             BOSS
               You're fired.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well you didn't have to say it like 
               that.
 
               
                             BOSS
               I want you out of here by the end of 
               the day.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What about the whole Christmas spirit 
               thing? Any flexability there?
 
               
                             BOSS
               Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give 
               you this.
 
               
               He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. 
               George walks out of the office "wearing" it.
 
               
               In the hall of the office.

               
                             ELAINE
               You had sex on your desk with the cleaning 
               woman.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You never had sex in the office before?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No. I once made out with someone but 
               that was it.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright so you made out with someone.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well that's not sex.

               
                             GEORGE
               Kissing is sex.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kissing is not sex.

               
                             JERRY
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next 
               to Dick's on purpose?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Over here.

               
                             ELAINE
               What are you doing here?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm taking the kid out to dinner to 
               chear him up.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey Jerry when do you consider that 
               sex has taken place?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I would say when the nipple makes its 
               first appearance.
 
               
               (Commercial)

               
                             ELAINE
               So, George told me that you left the 
               drink next to Dick's on purpose.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Nice try. So guess who heckled me at 
               the club last night.
 
               
               *crash*

               
                             DICK
               Merry Christmas.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hide, hide under the desk.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ow, ow move over.

               
                             JERRY
               Get off of me.

               
                             ELAINE
               I've got no room.

               
               Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks 
               down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, 
               his hand shaking.
 
               
                             DICK
               Is that cashmere?

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it's cashmere.

               
                             DICK
               (noticing the dot) What's this?

               
               At the comedy club.

               
                             JERRY
               But in a way, I think I inadvertantly 
               turned this guy into an alcoholic. I 
               hate being around alcoholics because 
               they're either telling you how much 
               they love you or how much they hate 
               you. And those are the two statements 
               that scare me the most. But I think 
               he's okay now because I have no idea 
               how he feels about me. He's finally 
               off the wagon.
 
               
                             DICK
               You mean on the wagon.

               
                             JERRY
               Don't get smart.

               
               
                            THE END
