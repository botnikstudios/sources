               ....hair that was on your shower soap 
               today could be in your head tomorrow. 
               How did they do the first transplant?
 
               
               
               Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it 
               in there by helicopter, you know
 
               
               keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. 
               "We got the hair but I think we lost
 
               
               the Zest."

               
               ....rejects the transplant with organs.

               
               Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . 
               Guy just standin' there and suddenly...
 
               
               ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in 
               someone's frozen yogurt.
 
               
               Jerry's apartment. A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry 
               doing work with headphones on.
 
               
                             REPAIRMAN
               .....The gaskets that you have here 
               are asymmetrical.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely 
               listening to him )
 
               
                             REPAIRMAN
               So I took off the motor relay on the 
               compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) 
               you've got some discoloration
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh! well whatever you have to do.

               
                             REPAIRMAN
               I was working with one.....mount at 
               a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb 
               the position of the compressor.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (sarcastically) No you don't..

               
               George enters the apartment.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey! what are listening to?

               
                             JERRY
               My show from last night.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh! you taped it?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah , I was doing new material.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the 
               toes that I said .
 
               
                             JERRY
               Huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain 
               of the toes, but sometimes the toe next 
               to the big toe gets so
 
               
               big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes 
               control of the foot.
 
               
                             JERRY
               The" coup dé-toe"

                             GEORGE

                             GEORGE
               Discovered a cure for baldness.

               
                             REPAIRMAN
               Did you see that last night?

               
                             GEORGE
               It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and 
               he is taping from a Camcorder) This 
               Chinese doctor Zeng Zau.
 
               
               has discovered a cure for baldness.

               
                             JERRY
               ( to Kramer) What's this?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well I just got it. Spector gave it 
               to me , he's giving everything away...becoming 
               a minimalist.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Is that the guy who likes fat women?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with 
               the minimalism.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               ( to George) You , you know what you 
               should've done is watching that report 
               on CNN last night.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I did, I'm trying to call China.

               
                             KRAMER
               You can't call China now its like, what, 
               three 'O clock in the morning there

                             GEORGE

                             JERRY
               Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! 
               I can't believe what I'm hearing. This 
               woman his talking to
 
               
               me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've 
               never heard anything like this in my life.
 
               
               Listen to this.

               
                             GEORGE
               (George puts on the headphones) Oh! 
               my god...
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Give me it..( tries to pull them off 
               George's head)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?

               just listening and she came on.

               All right Come on....again attempts 
               to pull headphones off)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where 
               was the tape recorder?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It was in the back of the room on the 
               left, she must have been sitting right 
               in front of it.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               My god!!!

               gives the headphones to Kramer) How 
               you gonna find out who this is?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Good question.

                             GEORGE
               What do the Chinese have to gain by 
               faking a cure for baldness?
 
               
                             JERRY
               If it was real ,they would never let 
               it out of the country. No baldness , 
               it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

               that and then leave no way to get in 
               touch with her.

               have you and she jumped off
 
               
               the George Washington Bridge.

               that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this 
               film work.

               sex not being simulated . That was really 
               funny.

               Elaine gets out of the car , George tries to catch his breath.
 
               
               
               Back to Jerry's.

               think she was gonna leave this incredibly
 
               
               erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not 
               Bloody likely...

               That's the worst cockney accent I've 
               ever heard in my life.( George enters) 
               Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I

               the camera. Listen I know your skeptical 
               , but I really believe

                             JERRY
               Yes I am skeptical.

               
                             GEORGE
               Why do you have to be so suspicious 
               of every one. This is a great man Zeng 
               Zau, he wants to help bald people.

               lets videotape your head for the before 
               picture, so we can watch
 
               
               how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A 
               little bit to the right.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Make sure you get this area here, where 
               he needs the help....
 
               
                             GEORGE
               All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)

                             JERRY
               Happy camper , I don't hear that expression 
               enough.
 
               
               Kramer; Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found 
               at my mother's house.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             KRAMER
               My mother told me that he got arrested 
               for mail fraud
 
               
                             JERRY
               No kidding?

               
                             KRAMER
               He's in jail.

               
                             JERRY
               What happened to the jacket. Did he 
               take it with him?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               That's what I intend to find out. (George 
               comes out of the bathroom and he's got 
               white cream on his head)

               It stinks. Can you smell that?....You 
               stink.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How long are you suppose to leave it 
               on for?
