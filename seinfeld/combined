               Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the 
               car will behave as
 
               if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone 
               disturbs it,
 
               it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. 
               Not
 
               everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't 
               it be nice
 
               if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? 
               You know, somebody
 
               tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would 
               like a car alarm
 
               like that.

               
               
               First scene.

               Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.

               
                             JERRY
               Do you believe this? The car was parked 
               right out front.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Was the alarm on?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't 
               know my alarm sound; I'm not
 
               tuned in to it like it's my son.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't understand, how do these thieves 
               start the car?
 
               
                             JERRY
               They cross the wires or something.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Cross the wires? I can't even make a 
               pot of spaghetti.
 
               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             JERRY
               They stole my car.

               
                             KRAMER
               Who did?

               
                             JERRY
               They did.

               
                             KRAMER
               Was it more than just one?

               
                             JERRY
               What should I do, should I call the 
               police?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What are they gonna do?

               
                             JERRY
               I'd better call the car phone company, 
               cancel my service.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe you should call your car phone.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, he's probably driving it right 
               now.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wait a minute, call the car phone, see 
               what happens.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Are you serious?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, go ahead, call.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't even know if I remember the 
               number.
 
               
               Jerry dials.

               
                             JERRY
               What do I say if he picks up?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Hello?

               
                             JERRY
               Hello? Is this 555-8383?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               I have no idea.

               
                             JERRY
               Can I ask you a question?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Sure.

               
                             JERRY
               Did you steal my car?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Yes I did.

               
                             JERRY
               You did?!

               
                             CAR THIEF
               I did.

               
                             JERRY
               That's my car!

               
                             CAR THIEF
               I didn't know it was yours.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you gonna do with it?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               I dunno, drive around.

               
                             JERRY
               Then can I have it back?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.

               
               Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hello?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Yeah, who's this?

               
                             KRAMER
               Kramer.

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Hello, Kramer.

               
                             KRAMER
               Listen, there's a pair of gloves in 
               the glove compartment.
 
               
                             CAR THIEF
               Wait, hold on... Brown ones?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to 
               me? Or bring them by my
 
               building, it's 129 West 81st St.

               
                             CAR THIEF
               One-two-nine, okay.

               
                             KRAMER
               Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?

               
                             CAR THIEF
               Jerry?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, let me ask you a question. How 
               do you cross those wires?
 
               
                             CAR THIEF
               I didn't cross any wires, the keys were 
               in it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, 
               I gotta go. Drive carefully.
 
               
                             CAR THIEF
               Jerry, when's the last time you had 
               a tune-up? Because I can't find
 
               the--

               
               Jerry hangs up.

               
                             JERRY
               Sid left the keys in the car.

               
                             GEORGE
               Who's Sid?

               
                             JERRY
               He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks 
               cars on the block.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What do you mean?

               
                             JERRY
               He moves them from one side of the street 
               to the other so you don't get
 
               a ticket.

               
                             GEORGE
               What, do you pay him for that?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.

               
                             GEORGE
               How many people does he do that for?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               He only works three hours a day. He 
               makes a fortune. Course he's been
 
               
               doing that for years, right Jerry?

               
                             GEORGE
               Could anybody do that?

               
               Sid enters.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey Sid, what happened?

               
                             SID
               I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting 
               too old for this stuff.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You left the keys in the car?

               
                             SID
               Well, you know they're making that Woody 
               Allen movie in the block, and all
 
               
               those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have 
               got a little
 
               distracted.

               
                             KRAMER
               You know I'm in that movie?

               
                             GEORGE
               You are?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, I'm an extra.

               
                             GEORGE
               How'd you get that?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, I was just watching them film 
               yesterday and some guy just asked
 
               
               me.

               
                             GEORGE
               Right out of the clear blue sky?

               
                             KRAMER
               Clear blue sky!

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, why didn't they ask me?

               
                             KRAMER
               I got a quality.

               
                             SID
               Jerry, you got insurance, right?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent 
               one.
 
               
                             SID
               Well I'm going down to visit my sister 
               in Virginia next Wednesday, for a
 
               
               week, so I can't park it.

               
                             JERRY
               This Wednesday?

               
                             SID
               No, next Wednesday, week after this 
               Wednesday.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But the Wednesday two days from now 
               is the next Wednesday.
 
               
                             SID
               If I meant this Wednesday, I would have 
               said this Wednesday. It's the
 
               week after this Wednesday.

               
                             GEORGE
               Sid, who's gonna move the cars while 
               you're away?
 
               
                             SID
               Whoever wants to move them, why do I 
               care who moves them? They can move
 
               
               themselves if they want.

               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe I could move them until you get 
               back.
 
               
                             SID
               What's a young man like you want to 
               move cars for? You don't work?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I'm in a transition phase right now.

               Well if you want to move the cars, move

                             ELAINE
               I'm in awe of his intellect, when he 
               talks it sounds like he's reading
 
               
               from one of his novels.

               
                             JERRY
               Owen March, I never heard of him.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, he's not a baseball player.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like 
               it's going pretty good.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What's that?

               Can I help you? Name please?

               
                             JERRY
               Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a 
               mid-size, and she's a small. I'm
 
               kidding around, of course.

               
                             AGENT
               Okay, let's see here.

               
                             JERRY
               Sixty-six years old?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. 
               He works out, he's vibrant. You'd
 
               
               really like him.

               
                             JERRY
               Why do people always say that? I hate 
               everyone, why would I like him?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What do you think, would you go out 
               with a sixty-six year old woman?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I'll tell you, she would have 
               to be really vibrant. So vibrant,
 
               
               she'd be spinning.

               
                             AGENT
               I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available 
               at the moment.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't understand, I made a reservation, 
               do you have my reservation?
 
               
                             AGENT
               Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out 
               of cars.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But the reservation keeps the car here. 
               That's why you have the
 
               reservation.

               
                             AGENT
               I know why we have reservations.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't think you do. If you did, I'd 
               have a car. See, you know how to
 
               take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation 
               and
 
               that's really the most important part of the reservation, the 
               holding. Anybody
 
               can just take them.

               
                             AGENT
               Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.
 
               
               
               The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she 
               can be seen
 
               speaking with someone.

               
                             JERRY
               Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You 
               know what she's saying over there?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               Hey Marge, you see those two people 
               over there? They think I'm talking
 
               
               to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you 
               start talking.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, you mean like this? So it looks 
               like I'm saying something but I'm
 
               
               not really saying anything at all?

               
                             JERRY
               Now you say something else and they 
               won't yell at me 'cause they thought
 
               
               I was checking with you.

               
                             ELAINE
               Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, 
               see you later.
 
               
               The agent returns.

               
                             AGENT
               I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's 
               nothing we can do.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, it looked as if you were in a 
               real conversation over there.
 
               
                             AGENT
               But we do have a compact if you would 
               like that.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Fine.

               
                             AGENT
               Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort 
               for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you
 
               like insurance?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, you better give me the insurance, 
               because I am gonna beat the hell
 
               out of this car.

               
                             AGENT
               Please fill this out.

               
                             ELAINE
               What do you think, you think I'm making 
               a big mistake?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's 
               what's important.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I love being with him. I mean, I like 
               being with him. It's okay being
 
               with him.

               
               
               New scene.

               Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

               
                             ELAINE
               I just don't enjoy being with him.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well that's what's important.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's 
               around the corner, do I have to
 
               break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over 
               the phone?
 
               
                             JERRY
               How many times you been out with him?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Seven?

               
                             JERRY
               Face to face.

               
                             ELAINE
               Seven dates is a face-to-face break 
               up?
 
               
                             JERRY
               If it was six I could have let you go, 
               but seven, I'm afraid, is over
 
               the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
 
               
               
               Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him 
               out of the way
 
               and heads for the kitchen sink.

               
                             KRAMER
               Whoa, whoa!!

               
                             JERRY
               What is going on out there?

               
                             GEORGE
               I need like a bucket of water! I got 
               a car overheating, I got an alarm
 
               
               that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! 
               What do I
 
               do?! Help me! Help me!

               
               George runs off into the bathroom.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, you know they were supposed to 
               do my scene today?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Today?!

               
                             KRAMER
               You know they told me that they wanted 
               me to walk down the block
 
               carrying this bag of groceries.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             KRAMER
               So I start to walk, and I trip, and 
               the grocery bag goes flying, and
 
               Woody, Woody starts laughing.

               
                             ELAINE
               He was laughing?!

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh yeah, he was drinking something, 
               it started to come out of his nose.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So then what?

               
                             KRAMER
               I got a line in the movie!

               
                             ELAINE
               Get out!

               
                             JERRY
               That's great!

               
                             GEORGE
               You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Pretty good, huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might 
               have a whole new career on my
 
               hands, huh?

               
                             JERRY
               You mean *a* career.

               
                             ELAINE
               So was Mia Farrow there?

               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, I didn't see him.

               
                             ELAINE
               What's your line?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, 
               Woody, you know, I'm at this bar
 
               and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
 
               
               
               The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.

               
                             KRAMER
               So I'm sitting there with Woody and 
               I say, I turn to him and I go,
 
               "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."

               
                             GEORGE
               Is that how you're gonna say it?

               
                             KRAMER
               No, no, I'm working on it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Do it like this. "These pretzels are 
               making me thirsty."
 
               
                             JERRY
               No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               No, no. See, that's no good. See, you 
               don't know how to act.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
 
               
               
               Jerry pinches his nose.

               
                             GEORGE
               That was no good?

               
                             KRAMER
               I didn't say anything.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm gonna go break up with Owen.

               
                             GEORGE
               What was wrong with that? I had a different 
               interpretation! Do you
 
               know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the 
               bar a really long
 
               time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman 
               and he's
 
               parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! 
               Alright!
 
               Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels 
               are making me
 
               thirsty!

               
               George storms out.

               
               
               New scene.

               Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding 
               on the door, Jerry
 
               opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh my god.

               
                             ELAINE
               Call an ambulance.

               
                             JERRY
               Boy, he took it hard.

               
               
               New scene.

               Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what 
               happened.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               We were walking down the block right 
               by your house and I was just about
 
               
               to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one 
               twenty nine west
 
               Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.

               
                             ELAINE
               Tell then to hurry! Hurry!

               
                             JERRY
               It's an ambulance. (To the operator) 
               I don't know but he's
 
               unconscious.

               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             KRAMER
               These pretzels are making me thirsty. 
               (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy,
 
               these pretzels are making me thirsty.

               
                             JERRY
               Kramer.

               
                             KRAMER
               What happened here?

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know, I don't know, what should 
               we do? We called an ambulance,
 
               does anyone know first aid?

               
                             JERRY
               Shouldn't you do something with the 
               extremities?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What extremities?

               
                             KRAMER
               What's an extremity?

               
                             JERRY
               You raise the feet, get blood to the 
               head.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You raise the head, you get blood to 
               the feet.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Okay, what about a cold compress? They 
               always do that.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't have a washcloth.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well use a paper towel.

               
                             JERRY
               You can't put a paper towel on his head.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What about a big sponge?

               
                             JERRY
               How you gonna hold it on there?

               
                             KRAMER
               Use a belt.

               
                             ELAINE
               No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip 
               all over him.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Should we walk him around?

               
                             ELAINE AND KRAMER
               Yes, yes.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, I've seen them do that.

               
                             JERRY
               No, no that's for a drug overdose.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Maybe that's what he's got.

               
                             ELAINE
               No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch 
               with him, he didn't leave the
 
               table.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well he could have dropped acid when 
               you weren't looking.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               He is not a drug addict!

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, 
               he might just need a cookie
 
               or something.

               
                             ELAINE
               A cookie!

               
                             KRAMER
               Can you give him a cookie?

               
                             ELAINE
               How's he gonna chew it?

               
                             JERRY
               We'll move his teeth, it happened to 
               my uncle, the sugar revived him.
 
               
               Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his 
               jaw up and down.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Careful, you're getting crumbs all over 
               him.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I got him chewing but I don't think 
               he's gonna swallow.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You know what, let's put a few cookies 
               in a blender and he could drink
 
               it.

               
                             JERRY
               Cookies don't liquefy.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Alright I'll get a blender.

               
                             JERRY
               What blender? I don't have a blender.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               You got a blender.

               
                             JERRY
               I would know if I had a blender.

               
                             ELAINE
               Where is the ambulance?!

               
               Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed 
               by a
 
               crashing sound.

               
               The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.

               
                             JERRY
               Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance 
               like thirty-five
 
               minutes ago.

               
                             ELAINE
               I can't believe what's going on out 
               here.
 
               
                             JERRY
               This is an emergency, what's taking 
               so long? (the door buzzer buzzes)
 
               
               Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?

               
                             VOICE
               Paramedics.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up. Okay, they're here.

               
                             ELAINE
               He seems to be breathing.

               
                             JERRY
               Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty 
               good-looking guy.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I know.

               
                             JERRY
               Those eyebrows could use a trimming, 
               you ever mention that to him?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Almost.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild 
               there.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               It's not an easy thing to bring up.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, that's true.

               
                             ELAINE
               Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, 
               it's all silk.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he 
               wears slippers.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               He does, how'd you know that?

               
                             JERRY
               I could tell.

               
               Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.

               
                             ELAINE
               What happened, what took you so long?!
 
               
               
                             PARAMEDIC
               We got here twenty minutes ago but we 
               couldn't move, the whole
 
               intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. 
               So finally we
 
               make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking 
               cars slammed into
 
               us with a blue Escort.

               
                             JERRY
               Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
 
               
               
               George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh man.

               
                             JERRY
               What happened to the car?

               
                             GEORGE
               Sorry, you don't know what's going on 
               out there! (looks at Owen)
 
               Who's he?

               
                             ELAINE
               This guy I'm seeing.

               
                             GEORGE
               What happened?

               
                             JERRY
               We don't know!

               
                             PARAMEDIC
               Who put cookies in his mouth?

               So how'd you hit the car?

               I was moving it across the street, I 
               looked up and I saw Woody Allen
 
               and I got all distracted.

               It's not even my car, it's a rental.

               What are you doing out there?! You're 
               holding up the production of the
 
               movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue 
               jacket who's got the street all
 
               screwed up?'

               
                             GEORGE
               Should I apologize to Woody?

               
                             KRAMER
               Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time 
               I talk to him, maybe I'll bring
 
               it up. I'll feel him out.

               What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of 
               years ago? You
 
               know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no 
               equipment.
 
               Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole 
               first aid.
 
               They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 
               'No, no we
 
               can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if 
               you know that. Did
 
               you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before 
               anybody.'

                             SID
               Now you didn't tell me you didn't know 
               how to drive. You should have
 
               mentioned that.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well I know how to drive.

               
                             SID
               Then how'd all those cars get damaged? 
               Why are people calling me up
 
               screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.

               
                             JERRY
               Can I get anybody anything?

               Moving cars from one side of the street 
               to the other don't take no more
 
               sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is 
               who's putting your
 
               pants on?

               
                             GEORGE
               I put my pants on, Sid.

               
                             SID
               I don't believe you. If you can put 
               your pants on, you can move those
 
               
               cars.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well I don't want to get into a big 
               dispute about the pants.
 
               
                             SID
               Who's gonna send money to my sister 
               in Virginia? Her little boy needs
 
               
               surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp 
               because you can't
 
               park a few cars.

               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe I could call my father.

                             KRAMER
               Hey, you seen the paper yet?

               
                             JERRY
               Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as 
               it is my paper.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. There's an article in there about 
               that writer.
 
               
               Jerry (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered 
               a stroke
 
               yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.

               
                             KRAMER
               Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. 
               You're the friend.
 
               
                             JERRY
               The extent of the damage would have 
               been far less severe
 
               had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.

               The commotion also delayed production 
               of a Woody Allen movie
 
               that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary 
               filmmaker said
 
               that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days 
               of shooting
 
               movies in New York were over.

                             ELAINE
               Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds 
               away from breaking up with
 
               him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, 
               it's over.'
 
               
                             JERRY
               Can he communicate?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he 
               understands me, he seems to enjoy
 
               
               it when I read to him.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the 
               counter) Hi, I called before,
 
               uh, my car got smashed.

               
                             ELAINE
               So listen, what should I do? I mean 
               if I break up with him now it'll
 
               look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be 
               ostracized from
 
               the community.

               
                             JERRY
               What community? There's a community?

               and sixty-six dollars.

               
                             JERRY
               Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything 
               so...
 
               
                             AGENT
               Yes, now, uh, in your report you said 
               that you were not the driver of
 
               the car at the time of the accident.

               
                             JERRY
               That is right, somebody else was driving.
 
               
               
                             AGENT
               Alright, well, sir, you're only covered 
               for when you're driving the car.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Uh huh, what's that?

               
                             AGENT
               You're not covered for other drivers.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Other drivers?

               Um hm.

               
                             JERRY
               Your whole business is based on other 
               drivers. It's a rented car.
 
               That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card 
               cover me or
 
               something?

               
                             AGENT
               Not that particular one.

               
                             JERRY
               Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick 
               a card, take a card, any card you
 
               
               want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.

               
                             AGENT
               Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--
 
               
               
                             JERRY

               It's like the Declaration of

                             AGENT
               Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, 
               you are not covered for that
 
               damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about 
               that.

               Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't
 
               they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean 
               in the south, are
 
               they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like 
               my Yankee

               Owen, I
 
               think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would 
               be nice if *we*
 
               could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming 
               here, and uh,
 
               feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's 
               good stuff.
 
               Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! 
               But at this
 
               point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make 
               a commitment to one
 
               person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. 
               For example, I
 
               like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and 
               skiing, and um,
 
               well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a 
               bitch to get here.
 
               It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to 
               take the
 
               double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends.

               No no no, I got it.

               
                             JERRY
               Please.

               
                             GEORGE
               No come on, let me, let me. I smashed 
               your car, it cost you over two
 
               thousand dollars,

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
 
               
               
               Kramer enters and sits down.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you doing here?

               
                             KRAMER
               I got fired from the movie.

               
                             GEORGE
               Get out of here, why?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you know they were gonna shoot 
               it today, and uh, we rehearsed it
 
               
               twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 
               'These pretzels
 
               are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and 
               I slammed the
 
               glass down on the bar and it shattered.

               
                             ELAINE
               Aww.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, one of the pieces must have hit 
               Woody. He started crying. And
 
               he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, 
               she came up
 
               to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that 
               scene.
 
               
               Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the 
               gloves.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out 
               loud.

               I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. 
               And the best part
 
               of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was 
               to get married,
 
               you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better 
               or for worse, all
 
               I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. 
               Do you take
 
               this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. 
               Rest of the
 
               time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get 
               the sniffles, you
 
               better be there.

               
               
               
                                   THE END

               To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and 
               they're
 
               working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape 
               but the
 
               strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. 
               The only
 
               reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through 
               the
 
               workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for 
               when we have
 
               to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing 
               I don't get
 
               about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty 
               towels and
 
               smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these 
               disgusting gym
 
               clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt 
               because he
 
               has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't 
               even think
 
               about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of 
               these locks
 
               you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff 
               is safe.

               Wide open, I was wide open underneath! 
               I had three inches on that
 
               guy. You two were hogging the ball.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the 
               ball. All you do is dribble.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I have to dribble, if I give it to you, 
               you just shoot. You're a
 
               chucker.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh I'm a chucker.

               
                             JERRY
               That's right, everytime you get the 
               ball you shoot.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't believe you called me a chucker. 
               No way I'm a chucker, I do
 
               not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, 
               no chuck!
 
               
                             JERRY
               You chuck.

               Kramer am I a chucker?

               
               
                             KRAMER
               You're a chucker.

               
                             GEORGE
               All these years I've been chuckin' and 
               you've never told me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well it's not an easy thing to bring 
               up.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey you know this is the first time 
               we've ever seen each other naked.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Believe me I didn't see anything.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?

               
                             JERRY
               No, did you?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, I snuck a peak.

               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
                             KRAMER
               Why not? hey what about you George?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But 
               it was so fast I didn't see
 
               anything. It was just a blur.

               
                             JERRY
               I made a conscious effort not to look. 
               There's certain information I just
 
               
               don't want to have.

               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. 
               I'll see you later.
 
               
                             JERRY
               All right

               
                             KRAMER
               Have a good one.

                             GEORGE
               look at this guy. Does he have to stretch 
               in here?
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know who that is? That's

               
                             GEORGE
               Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, that's him.

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you sure?

               
                             JERRY
               Positive.

               
                             GEORGE
               Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great 
               player.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's 
               a Civil War buff.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... 
               What do you have to do to be a buff
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well 
               sleeping less than 18 hours a day
 
               
               would be a start.

               
                             GEORGE
               ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two 
               weeks left of unemployment. I got
 
               
               to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, should we say something to him?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from 
               fans in the locker room.
 
               
                             JERRY
               well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't 
               mind.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you comparing yourself to Keith 
               Hernandez. The guys a baseball
 
               player Jerry, Baseball!

               
                             JERRY
               I know what he is. I recognized him. 
               You didn't even notice him.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What, ... you are making some wisecracks 
               in a night club... wo wo wo.
 
               The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.

               Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, 
               I'm Keith Hernandez and I just
 
               want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

               
                             JERRY
               Really?

               
                             KEITH
               I've always wanted to do what you do.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What I do? You are one of my favorite 
               ball players of all time
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Mine too.

               
                             KEITH
               I love that bit about Jimmy Olson

               
                             JERRY
               Thank you.

               
                             GEORGE
               You know Keith, what I've always wondered, 
               with all these ball clubs
 
               flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane 
               crash? ...
 
               
                             KEITH
               (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in 
               new York right now?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm performing in this club on the east 
               Side. You should come in.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               But if you think about it...26 teams, 
               162 games a season, you'd think
 
               eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

               
                             KEITH
               You know, I live on the East Side.
 
               
               
                             JERRY

                             KEITH

               cup of coffee
 
               
                             JERRY

                             JERRY
               It's been three days and he hasn't called.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well maybe you should call him.

               
                             JERRY
               I can't ... I can't

               
                             ELAINE
               Why not?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. I just feel he should 
               call me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What's the difference?

               
                             JERRY
               You don't understand, Elaine. I don't 
               want to be overanxious. If he wants
 
               
               to see me he has my number, he should call.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I can't stand these guys. You give your 
               number to them and then they
 
               don't call. Why do they do that?

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sorry honey.

               
                             JERRY
               I mean, I thought he liked me. I really 
               thought he liked me. we were
 
               getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.

               
                             ELAINE
               No,

               
                             JERRY
               Why did he come over to me if he didn't 
               want to see me?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I know.

               
                             JERRY
               What did he come over to me if he didn't 
               want to see me? I mean here I
 
               meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever 
               met in my life.
 
               .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another 
               guy again.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Sometimes I've given my number out to 
               guys and it takes them a month to
 
               
               call.

               
                             JERRY
               Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling 
               in a month he's got a prayer!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe 
               he's been out of town?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, they don't have phones out of town? 
               Why do(?) people say they're
 
               too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How 
               can you be
 
               too busy?

               
                             ELAINE
               Why don't you just go ahead and call 
               him?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. 
               I mean what am I going to say to
 
               him?

               
                             ELAINE
               Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               For what dinner?

               
                             ELAINE
               Dinner's good.

               
                             JERRY
               Don't you think that's coming on a little 
               too strong? .. Isn't that like
 
               a turn off?

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, He's A GUY!

               
                             JERRY
               ... this is all .. very confusing.

               When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. 
               Whatever the
 
               group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're 
               not
 
               interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not 
               interested in
 
               seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't 
               know the food.
 
               They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on 
               the gym or
 
               someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have 
               a lot of
 
               potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when 
               you're a kid,
 
               you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little 
               kid what were
 
               the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's 
               my friend,
 
               they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! 
               Come on in. Jump
 
               up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at 
               all, You like
 
               Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!

               Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over 
               and see
 
               the baby.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Who are they?

               
                             JERRY
               Uh, he's this guy who used to live in 
               the building and they keep calling
 
               
               us to see the baby.

               
                             JERRY
               (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - 
               When are ya' gonna see the babi...
 
               
               Can't they just send us a tape?

               
                             ELAINE
               You know if you waited a few more months 
               it won't be a baby anymore
 
               then you wouldn't have to see it.

               
                             JERRY
               uh uh because then it would be all grown 
               up.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               yeah ha ha ha

               
                             JERRY

               shirt?

                             ELAINE
               It looks like you're trying too hard 
               to make an impression on him.
 
               You're not being yourself.

               
                             KRAMER

               him.

                             JERRY
               Hellooo Newman.

               
                             KRAMER
               I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               I despise him.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Why? I'll tell you why...

               
                             KRAMER
               Let me tell it ..

               
                             NEWMAN
               No, you can't tell it ..

               
                             KRAMER
               You always tell it ..

               
                             NEWMAN
               All right, tell it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Ja ja ja - just tell it

               
                             NEWMAN
               June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're 
               enjoying a beautiful afternoon
 
               in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a 
               five run Phillies
 
               ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

               
                             KRAMER
               Our day was ruined. There was a lot 
               of people, you know, they were
 
               waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the 
               ramp ... (cut
 
               to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella 
               man and
 
               everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!) ... Newman was in front 
               of me. Keith
 
               was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice 
               game pretty
 
               boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.

               
                             NEWMAN
               A second later, something happened that 
               changed us in a deep and
 
               profound way front that day forward.

               
                             ELAINE
               What was it?

               
                             KRAMER
               He spit on us.... and I screamed out, 
               "I'm hit!"
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Then I turned and the spit ricochet 
               of him and it hit me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Wow! What a story.

               
                             JERRY
               Unfortunately the immutable laws of 
               physics contradict the whole premise
 
               
               of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss 
               Benes as
 
               I've heard this story a number of times.

               
                             JERRY
               Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. 
               According to your story Keith
 
               passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were 
               struck on
 
               the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the 
               temple
 
               striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then 
               cam off
 
               the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him 
               to drop his
 
               baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In 
               mid air
 
               mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. 
               That is one
 
               magic luggie.

               
               (THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF 
               KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM SCENE IN
 
               THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!)
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               Well that's the way it happened.

               
                             JERRY
               What happened to your head when you 
               got hit?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well. uh, well my head went back and 
               to the left
 
               
                             JERRY
               Again

               
                             KRAMER
               Back and to the left

               
                             JERRY
               Back and to the left Back and to the 
               left
 
               
                             ELAINE
               So, what are you saying?

               
                             JERRY
               I am saying that the spit could not 
               have come from behind ... that there 
               had to have been
 
               a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the 
               spitter was behind you as you claimed
 
               that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

               
                             ELAINE
               So the spit could have only come from 
               the front and to the right.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But that is not what they would have 
               you believe.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Wait, wait, (Exits)

               
                             JERRY
               The sad thing is we may never know the 
               real truth.
 
               
               (George runs in)

               
                             GEORGE
               (Frantically) Did anybody call here 
               asking for Vandaley industries?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No. What happened to you?

               
                             GEORGE
               Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment 
               office and I told them that I was very 
               close
 
               to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your 
               phone number. So, when now when the phone
 
               rings you've got to answer "Vanadaley Industries".

               
                             JERRY
               I'm Vanadaley Industries?

               
                             GEORGE
               Right.

               
                             JERRY
               And what is that?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're in latex

               
                             JERRY
               Latex? And what do I do with latex?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Ya manufacture it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Here in this little apartment?

               
                             JERRY
               And what do I say about you?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're considering hiring me for your 
               latex salesman.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Right.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't think so. Why would I do that?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Because I asked you to.

               
                             JERRY
               If you think I'm looking for someone 
               to just sit at a desk pushing papers
 
               
               around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying 
               to
 
               manufacture the stuff.

               
               (Buzzer)

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             KRAMER
               It's Keith.

               I know who it was too. It was the guy 
               who interviewed me. He was
 
               very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could 
               sell
 
               latex like that (snaps fingers).

                             MRS. SOKOL
               Sign that.

               I I hope you don't mind my
 
               saying. She is breathtaking.

                             MRS. SOKOL
               Ya' think so?

                             GEORGE
               Ah, would you take this picture away 
               from me. Take it away and get
 
               it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.

                             MRS. SOKOL
               You know she doesn't even have a boyfriend.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're 
               talking to? What are ya'... you
 
               trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you 
               that.
 
                             MRS. SOKOL
               I'm serious.

                             GEORGE
               It's one think to not give me the extension 
               But to tease and to
 
               torture me like this. There's no call for that.

                             MRS. SOKOL
               Would you like her phone numba'?

                             MRS. SOKOL
               Mrs. Sokol I, I don't know what to say. 
               I, uh, where should I sign this
 
               thing?

                             MRS. SOKOL
               No no no, Don't worry about it.

               I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon 
               Johnson.

               Jerry, I can't believe it took you so 
               long to come see the baby. I kept saying 
               to
 
               Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"

                             JERRY
               I was saying the same thing.

               So, what did you say?

                             JERRY
               I said yes, but I don't feel right about 
               it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's 
               a
 
               big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all 
               the way.
 
                             ELAINE
               And you feel you're not really ready 
               for,...

               Well we went out one time. Don't you 
               think that's coming on a little too

               Keith Hernandez just asked me to help 
               him move.

               What? Well, you hardly know the guy.... 
               What a nerve. You see wasn't I
 
               right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going 
               to do it are you?
 
                             JERRY
               ... I said yes.

                             KRAMER
               YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride 
               or self respect? I mean, how
 
               can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going 
               to do? You're going
 
               to start driving him to the airport?

                             JERRY
               I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!

               Don't mention it to anybody.

               I wouldn't have brought it up but since 
               you mentioned it.
 
                             ELAINE
               Ha, I didn't mention it.

                             KEITH
               Well I won them anyway.

                             ELAINE
               Well so what. I mean you played first 
               base. I mean they always put the worst
 
               
               player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.

                             KEITH
               Elaine. you don't know the first thing 
               about first base.
 
                             ELAINE
               ha ha well I know something about getting 
               to first base. And I know you'll
 
               never be there.

               tonight at around eleven o'clock.

               waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're 
               really hitting it off. Get
 
               it? Get it?

               How do you kn ow?

                             JERRY
               Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And 
               I'm a guy.
 
                             GEORGE
               I suppose he's an attractive man, I 
               , ...
 
                             JERRY
               Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP( 
               1979. I'm making wise cracks in some
 
               
               night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. 
               They like go
 
               together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples 
               that look alike.
 
                             GEORGE
               Hate those couples. I could never bee 
               one of those couples. There are no bald
 
               
               woman around. You know?

                             JERRY
               You know I know this sounds a little 
               arrogant but I never thought she would 
               find
 
               anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had 
               my chance and that's
 
               that.

                             GEORGE
               You know what I would like to do? I 
               would really like to have sex with a 
               tall
 
               woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Really?

                             GEORGE
               What was the tallest woman you ever 
               slept with?
 
                             JERRY
               I don't know ... six three.

                             GEORGE
               Wow, ... god! You see this is all I think 
               about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my
 
               
               life's ambition.

                             JERRY
               So I guess it's fair to say you've set 
               different goals for yourself than say, 
               Thomas
 
               Edison, Magellan, these types of people.

                             GEORGE

                             JERRY

               anyway.

               then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment

               MOVE? Wow.

                             KRAMER
               He's got money. Why doesn't he just 
               pay a mover?

                             GEORGE
               129 west 81st street and hurry.

               
               (same cabby stares at him)

               
                             GEORGE
               Goodbye (exits cab)

                             KEITH
               Better bring your gloves, it's freezing 
               out there. It shouldn't take too long. 
               I'd
 
               say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not 
               that much. First we got
 
               the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.

                             JERRY
               Is there a box spring?

                             KEITH
               What's that?

                             JERRY
               Is there a box spring?

                             KEITH
               Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached 
               to the headboard and we'll have to take
 
               
               that apart. Then we got the couch.

                             JERRY
               Is that a sectional?

                             KEITH
               Yeah. Twelve pieces. (not clear) ...coffee 
               table.
 
                             JERRY
               Is that a thick marble?

               
               (... Jerry and Keith start to laugh and Jerry walks behind Keith 
               so they don't make eye
 
               contact and break up)

               
                             KEITH
               Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. 
               But the BIG problem is going to be the
 
               
               convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up 
               so it's going to be
 
               real difficult getting it down the stairs.

                             JERRY
               STAIRS??? There's no elevator?

                             KEITH
               Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do 
               it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't 
               know you. I
 
               can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.

               
               (Kramer enters, sees Keith and does a double take)

               
                             KRAMER
               Hello.

                             KEITH
               Hello.

                             KRAMER
               Oh, you don't remember me.

                             KEITH
               No should I (continuity error: in fact 
               he SHOULD from the basketball game)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, you should. I certainly remember 
               you. Let me refresh your memory.
 
               
               (Newman enters)

               
                             NEWMAN
               June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You 
               made a big error. Cost the Mets the
 
               
               game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.

                             KEITH
               YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Ah, you remember.

                             NEWMAN
               And then you spit on us.

                             KEITH
               Hey, I didn't spit at you.

                             NEWMAN
               Oh, yeah, right.

                             KRAMER
               No no no, well, then who was it?

                             KEITH
               Well lookit, the way I remember it (back 
               to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was
 
               
               walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when 
               you called me pretty
 
               boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something 
               and as I turned
 
               around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely 
               road. ...
 
               Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. 
               I tried to scream
 
               out but it was too late. It was already on its way.

                             JERRY
               I told you!

                             NEWMAN
               Wow, it was McDowell.

                             JERRY
               But why? Why McDowell?

                             KRAMER
               Well, maybe because we were sitting 
               in the right field stands cursing at 
               him
 
               in the bullpen all game.

                             NEWMAN
               He must have caught a glimpse of us 
               when I poured that beer on his head.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               It was McDowell.

                             KRAMER
               Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're 
               sorry.
 
                             NEWMAN
               Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
 
               
                             KEITH
               look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, 
               Well I guess I better get going.
 
                             KRAMER
               Wait, uh what are ya' doing?

                             KEITH
               I gotta move.

                             KRAMER
               Want any help?

                             KEITH
               I'd love some.

                             KRAMER
               I'd love to help you move.

                             NEWMAN
               Me too.

                             KEITH
               Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one 
               thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile
 
               
               We're going to have to handle it like a baby.

                             KRAMER
               No sweat.

               
               (they exit)

               
               (phone rings)

               (George frantically enters)

                             GEORGE
               Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's 
               Keith?

               do you need him for?

               Can you do me a favor? I need you

               Wait.

               Well Biff/ What's next?

                             GEORGE
               I don't know.

               
               (Tall girl enters)

               
                             TALL GIRL
               Excuse me. I was walking behind you 
               and you dropped your wallet.

               When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all 
               you think about is
 
               boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the 
               street going in and out
 
               of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean 
               it's all you think
 
               about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. 
               Shut up I'm looking
 
               for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it 
               you can smell them. You walk
 
               into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have 
               boxes. Dammit, I can
 
               SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard 
               in the morning. You
 
               could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and 
               your looking at the
 
               casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got 
               that box? When he's
 
               done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice 
               handles on it. And that's
 
               what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The 
               hearse is like the van. The
 
               pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask 
               to help you with a big
 
               move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've 
               been waiting for your
 
               whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.
 
               
               
               
                                     THE END

               There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly 
               changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's 
               a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's 
               constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like 
               some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open 
               up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows 
               what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land 
               in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and 
               all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going 
               'I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?.'
 
               
               
               
               (George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across 
               the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says 
               Grand opening.)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always 
               think I'm nice, but women don't like 
               nice.
 
               
                             JERRY
               This is amazing, I haven't seen one 
               guy going in to that restaurant since 
               it opened. Poor guy.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society 
               we are living in, when nice is bad?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What's that smell? What are you wearing?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Little cologne.

               
                             JERRY
               Manly.

               
                             GEORGE
               Monica wants me to wear it.

               
                             JERRY
               So why didn't you say no?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm too nice.

               
                             JERRY
               Poor guy. His family is probably in 
               Pakistan waiting him to send back money. 
               This is horrible.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               She wants me to take an IQ test.

               
                             JERRY
               That's because you're stupid enough 
               to wear the cologne.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No, she's taking this course in education 
               for her masters. It's part of her research 
               project, I have to be a guinea pig.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I've never been a guinea pig. I've been 
               a sheep, a tody.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You know, I can't talk to you anymore.

               All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're 
               taking the IQ test.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a 
               moron. You know, people think I'm smart, 
               but I'm not smart.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Who thinks you're smart?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not going to break a hundred in 
               this thing.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What thing?

               
                             GEORGE
               You don't listen when people talk to 
               you anymore!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been 
               lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What did you get?

               
                             GEORGE
               What did I get or what do I say I got?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What do you say?

               
                             GEORGE
               I say fourteen o nine (1409).

               
                             JERRY
               1409, that's a good score.

               
                             GEORGE
               You're telling me.

               
                             JERRY
               What did you really get?

               
                             GEORGE
               You are my friend.

               
                             JERRY
               Of course.

               
                             GEORGE
               I tell you everything, right?

               
                             JERRY
               I hope so.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, this I take to the grave.

               
               
               (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars 
               and Elaine is reading a newspaper.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. 
               He's all over the place. That's why 
               no one is going in.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Why do you keep watching?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. 
               It's like a spider in the toilet struggling 
               for a survival. And even if you know 
               it's not going to make it, you kind 
               of root it for awhile.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               And then you flush.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, it's a spider.

               
                             ELAINE
               You know, sometimes people won't go 
               in to a place, if they don't see anyone 
               else in there.
 
               
               (Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.)

               
                             ELAINE
               You have to do that? Jerry, don't do 
               that, that is so annoying.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Bazooka Joe.

               
               (Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at Elaine who is closer to the 
               door.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               The buzzer.

               
                             ELAINE
               It's your house.

               
                             JERRY
               My house? You have to be on the lease 
               to press to buzzer. Yeah?
 
               
                             INTERCOM
               It's George.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             ELAINE
               Casus belli.

               
                             JERRY
               What's that?

               
                             ELAINE
               It's Latin. I read it in some book. 
               I don't know, I just wanted to say it 
               out loud.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Go in, go in!

               
                             ELAINE
               Have you gone in there?

               
                             JERRY
               No, I'm afraid if we start talking, 
               I'm gonna wind up going partners with 
               him.
 
               
               (George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.)

               
                             GEORGE
               Hi.

               
                             JERRY
               You know, I could probably shoot him 
               from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
 
               
               
               (Elaine sniffs around.)

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Sure, fine.

               
                             JERRY
               Casus belli.

               
                             ELAINE
               Casus belli.

               
                             GEORGE
               What's that?

               
                             ELAINE
               Since when do you wear cologne?

               
                             GEORGE
               Why what I do is so important? Why must 
               I be always the vocal point of attention? 
               Let me just be, let me live.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I didn't take it yet.

               
                             ELAINE
               What IQ test?

               
                             GEORGE
               What's casus belli.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, it's nothing...

               
                             GEORGE
               Is it about me?

               
                             JERRY
               Why must you always be the vocal point 
               of attention? Why can't you just be? 
               Why can't you live?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               It's just a Latin phrase George, it 
               does not mean anything. Now, what is 
               this test?
 
               
                             JERRY
               This woman he's dating is making him 
               to take this IQ test for this course.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, that sounds like fun.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. 
               They prove nothing.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You'll do well, you're smart.

               
                             JERRY
               No see, he's not smart. People think 
               he's smart, but he's not.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What did you get on your SAT's?

               
                             GEORGE
               It varies.

               
                             JERRY
               You know, I don't even know my IQ.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Mine's 145.

               
                             GEORGE
               145!

               
                             JERRY
               Get out of here!

               
                             ELAINE
               You get out of here!

               
                             JERRY
               You get out of here!

               
                             GEORGE
               You should take the test for me.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, that would be something, cheating 
               on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college 
               when you passed Lettick the test out 
               the window? You became a legend after 
               that.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back 
               then. Why wouldn't we do that again?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               You could take the IQ test for me. I 
               could pass it to you out the window. 
               We could do it, she lives in the first 
               floor.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Are you serious?

               
                             GEORGE
               Why not?

               
                             ELAINE
               Where would I take the test?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know, she lives right around 
               the corner. Take it here or go to the 
               coffee shop.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, that would be too noisy.

               
                             JERRY
               Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear 
               a peep.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, what do you think?

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, I love a good caper.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.

               
                             GEORGE
               You'll do it?

               
                             ELAINE
               What the hey.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeaah, beautiful...(They try to hit 
               a high five, but George hits Elaine 
               in the forehead.) Sorry...

               Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I've been looking forward to it.
 
               
               
                             BABU
               Oh, how did you hear about us?

               
                             JERRY
               Eh, people, people are talking.

               
                             BABU
               Smoking or non smoking? We are proud 
               to offer both.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Non smoking would be great.

               
                             BABU
               Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I 
               will be your waiter. A steaming hot 
               face cloth for your pleasure.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Thank you. (Throws the towel around 
               like a hot potato.)
 
               
                             BABU
               Our specials are tacos, moussaka and 
               franks and beans.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, what do you recommend my good 
               fellow?
 
               
                             BABU
               Oh, the turkey.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say 
               you have a splendid establishment here 
               , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in 
               this location for many many years.
 
               
               
                             BABU
               You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank 
               you. Very kind...
 
               
                             JERRY THINKS
               Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else 
               would do something like this? Nobody. 
               Nobody thinks about people like I do. 
               All right, snap out of it you stupid 
               jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. 
               What do want, a nobel price?
 
               
               
               (George is taking a test at Monica's bedroom.)

               
                             GEORGE
               You go in the living room. I'll take 
               the test in here.
 
               
                             MONICA
               But why?

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't concentrate in front of you.
 
               
               
                             MONICA
               Oh, I think you're making too much of 
               this. IQ tests don't mean anything.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Are you kidding me? This is the best 
               tool we have today of measuring a persons 
               intelligence.
 
               
                             MONICA
               Well, I certainly don't place any importance 
               on it.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I think you're wrong about that. 
               And now if you would excuse me, I would 
               like to get started please.
 
               
                             MONICA
               Good luck.

               
                             GEORGE
               Don't need it.

               
               (Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is 
               waiting.)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What's been going on in there? I've 
               been standing here for 20 minutes.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. 
               Thanks again for doing this.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               All right, what time do you want me 
               back here.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Eh, twenty to three.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ok.

               
                             GEORGE
               Thanks again.

               
                             ELAINE
               All right.

               
                             GEORGE
               And don't settle for 145, you can do 
               better, you're a genius.
 
               
               
               (Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for 
               Jerry.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. 
               You are quite the restaurateur I must 
               say.
 
               
                             BABU
               It is in deed my pleasure.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, please...

               
               (Elaine comes in.)

               
                             BABU
               Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials 
               today...
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast.
 
               
               
                             BABU
               Tea and toast.

               
                             JERRY
               Eat something! Babu...

               
                             ELAINE
               Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni.

               
                             BABU
               Oh, very good choice. Very good.

               
               (Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.)

               
                             JERRY
               Oh wow, so you got the test. You're 
               cheating.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I know.

               
               (Kramer comes in.)

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, 
               hi Elaine...
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey.

               
                             KRAMER
               This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers 
               house two years ago. Now, she hasn't 
               spoken to him since and now he says 
               he wants the jacket back.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, I'm not giving it back.

               
                             JERRY
               Why not?

               
                             KRAMER
               Because I meat a lot of women in this 
               jacket, you know they're attracted to 
               it. Why do you think my mother went 
               out with him?
 
               
               (Kramer takes some nachos and spills some to Elaine's test.)
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, gees...

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, ok...(takes the test and goes 
               to another table.)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Anyway, it's been two years. I mean 
               isn't there like statue of limitations 
               on that?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Statute.

               
                             KRAMER
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               No, statue.

               
                             JERRY
               Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! 
               Now you're smart, is it statue or statute 
               of limitations?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Statute.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, I really think you're wrong.

               
                             ELAINE
               Look, Kramer, I have to take this test 
               ok, I don't have a long of time.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What test?

               
                             ELAINE
               An IQ test.

               
                             KRAMER
               Why do you take an IQ test?

               
                             ELAINE
               It's for George.

               
                             KRAMER
               George?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you 
               later?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Why are you taking an IQ test for George?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Would you please?!

               
                             KRAMER
               What, is it for a job or something?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Later!

               
                             KRAMER
               You're positive it's statute?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes, yes!

               
                             BABU
               Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face 
               cloth...(gives Kramer a hot towel and 
               Kramer screams and falls from his chair.)

                             GEORGE
               Yeah?

               
                             MONICA
               The door is locked.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, it's locked?

               
                             MONICA
               I need to get something.

               
                             GEORGE
               Monica, I'm really focused here, this 
               stuff's a killer.
 
               
                             MONICA
               George!

               
                             GEORGE
               Wish I could.

               anyway.
 
               
                             BABU

                             BABU
               I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
 
               
               
                             BABU
               You're a very kind man.

               
                             JERRY
               Babu, you're Pakistani?

               
                             BABU
               Yes, Pakistani, yes.

               
                             JERRY
               Babu, may I say something?

               
                             BABU
               Of course, you're a very smart man, 
               I'll listen.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm not a restaurateur by any means, 
               but it occurred to me that perhaps you 
               might serve some dishes from your native 
               Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans 
               for example.
 
               
                             BABU
               But there are no Pakistani people here.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Doesn't matter. You would have the only 
               authentic Pakistani restaurant in the 
               whole neighborhood.
 
               
                             BABU
               Yes, you see everything, don't you?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well, not everything. I do what I can.
 
               
               
                             BABU
               I'll close down today and when I open 
               again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. 
               Thank you, thank you very much, you're 
               very special person, very special.

               I am such a great guy. Who else would've 
               gone through the trouble of helping 
               this poor immigrant? I am special. My 
               mother was right. Of course I've never 
               had Pakistani food. How bad it could 
               be?

               It was an accident.

               
                             GEORGE
               What did you go on a picnic?

               
                             ELAINE
               Babu Bhatt did it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain 
               this?

                             GEORGE
               Ok. (George opens the door.) Here you 
               go.
 
               
                             MONICA
               How did you do?

               
                             GEORGE
               Piece of cake.

               What happened to the test?

               
                             GEORGE
               What? I spilled some food on it.

               
                             MONICA
               Food? What food?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you talking about?

               
                             MONICA
               Where did you get food?

               
                             GEORGE
               From my pocket.

               
                             MONICA
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
 
               
               
                             MONICA
               And coffee?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.

               
                             MONICA
               Where did you get the coffee?

               
                             GEORGE
               Where did I get the coffee? Where do 
               think I got the coffee, from the grocery 
               store.
 
               
                             MONICA
               How did you get there?

               
                             GEORGE
               I walked.

               
                             MONICA
               How did you get out of the apartment? 
               I didn't see you leave.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I climbed out the window.

               
                             MONICA
               You climbed out the window?

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course.

               
                             MONICA
               Why didn't you go out the door?

               
                             GEORGE
               The door? Why would I go out the door? 
               The window is right here.

               Most people in a situation like this, 
               they walk right by it. Not me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You're very special.

               Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes 
               in looking for me, tell him you don't 
               know where I am.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Of course, I always do.

               
                             KRAMER
               No, no it's that guy. He's really been 
               bugging me about the jacket.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Just give it back to him.

                             GEORGE
               Coming up.

               
                             JERRY
               How did you do on the IQ test?!

               
                             GEORGE
               85!

               
                             JERRY
               What?!!

               
                             GEORGE
               85, Jerry! 85 IQ !

               
               (Jerry laughs.)

               
                             ELAINE
               85?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, well, well...

               
                             ELAINE
               He's coming up?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I'm no genius, but according to 
               my calculations he should be here in 
               a few seconds.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well, maybe the test was gender bias, 
               you know a lot of questions about hunting 
               and testicles...
 
               
               (George comes in looking angry.)

               Oh, hello professor.

               
                             ELAINE
               George, I cannot believe...

               
                             GEORGE
               Please...

               
                             ELAINE
               No there has got be a mistake.

               
                             GEORGE
               You should've seen her face. It was 
               the exact same look my father gave me 
               when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               But an 85?

               
                             ELAINE
               There were too many distractions there. 
               Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I 
               couldn't concentrate.
 
               
                             JERRY MOCKING
               It was a madhouse.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Whow, forget it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. 
               What do you have to lose?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You could do worst!

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, I guarantee it.

               
                             GEORGE
               All right, I'll ask her.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be 
               no distractions.

                             JERRY
               Well, congratulations my friend. You 
               know, I sorry I missed the grand re-opening. 
               I was out of town for about a week.
 
               
               
                             BABU
               You see how I listened. I worked very 
               hard, borrowed more money.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I think it's fantastic. Has a certain 
               indefinable charm.
 
               
                             BABU
               You wish to eat?

               
                             JERRY
               Let me tell you something Babu. You 
               go back there in that kitchen and tell 
               your chef I want the works.
 
               
                             BABU
               Very good.

               
                             JERRY THINKING
               Very good? No, not very good, very great. 
               I am very, very great.

               You know the IQ test has always that sample question at the beginning 
               where they show how to fill in the circle. It should be the first 
               eliminating point right there. Anybody goes outside of that circle, 
               yeah you wanna come with us, yeah you're done, the test is over, 
               you went outside the circle ok?

               What are you doing?

               
                             KRAMER
               Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.

               
                             ELAINE
               What's going on?

               
                             MAN BEHIND THE DOOR
               Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! 
               I'm not leaving until I get the jacket. 
               (Bangs on the door) Open up Kramer!
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Why did you come in here for?

               
                             KRAMER
               I thought I'd throw him off. See, he 
               knows where I live.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well Kramer, I have to return this test. 
               I've got to get out of here.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I thought you took the test.

               
                             ELAINE
               I had to take it again.

               
                             KRAMER
               How come?

               
                             ELAINE
               What's the difference?!!

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you can't leave now.

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             MAN BEHIND THE DOOR
               Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket 
               back!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Never!

               
               
               (Monica's apartment. George is looking out the window.)

               George, open up.

               
               (George opens the door.)

               
                             MONICA
               Well?

               
               (George shakes her hand.)

               
                             GEORGE
               How' you doing?

               
                             MONICA
               Where's the test?

               
                             GEORGE
               You know, it's the damnedest thing. 
               I went out the window again to get a 
               cup of coffee...
 
               
               
               (Dream Cafe. Babu is looking as Jerry eats.)

               Babu? Babu...(waves Babu to come to 
               table) Babu...you know, I got to tell 
               you, I never do this, but the shrimp, 
               it's just that it's a little stringy. 
               You have any chicken?
 
               
                             BABU
               The shrimp is stringy?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, maybe your refrigerator...

               
                             BABU
               Quiet!! You shut up! You make me change 
               restaurant, but nobody comes! You say 
               make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only 
               Pakistani restaurant. But where are 
               people? You see people? Show me people. 
               There are no people!
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know, I think I'll just take the 
               check.
 
               
                             BABU

               Well eh, kind of....

               
                             MONICA
               George left.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh.

               
                             MONICA
               Is that the test?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.

               Thanks. I hope you did do a lot better 
               this time.

               Actually, you know what, I think I did. 
               The first time I couldn't really cons...(Monica 
               closes the window)...entreat.

               know what my IQ is? 151.
 
               
                             JERRY
               151?

               
                             GEORGE
               That's a good score.

               It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional 
               good deed doers. Your lone rangers, your superman, your Batman, 
               your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They are all wearing disguises, 
               masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people 
               to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, thanks 
               for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? 
               I'm renting here, I've got a security deposit. What am I supposed 
               to do?"

               So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to 
               be making up some
 
               time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll 
               just make up
 
               time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. 
               Of course, when
 
               they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing 
               the speed of the
 
               aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't 
               you just go as
 
               fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, 
               nail it. Give it
 
               some gas! We're flying!

               
               New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative 
               (and inebriated)
 
               man.

               
                             GAVIN
               Travelling, of course, is the best education. 
               Do you know last year I
 
               was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone 
               to more but I had
 
               just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now 
               I won't travel
 
               without him.

               
                             JERRY
               Is he on the plane now?

               
                             GAVIN
               Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the 
               baggage compartment. I don't
 
               know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better 
               behaved than
 
               most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have 
               any pets?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Uh, just my next door neighbor.

               You're missing out on a relationship 
               that could enrich your life in ways
 
               
               that you never could have thought possible.

               
                             JERRY
               Howbout picking up their, you know. 
               You find that enriching?
 
               
               Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.

               
                             JERRY
               What's the matter?

               
                             GAVIN

               Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the 
               cabin where
 
               flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.

               to a hospital.

               Would you take care of Farfel?

               Farfel?

               It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago 
               to get him to a hospital,
 
               could you take his dog to New York?

               
                             JERRY
               The dog? The dog??

               
                             GAVIN
               I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

               But, you know, what if, you know?

               
                             GAVIN
               Give me your address and phone number, 
               I'll call you.

               The dog?

               
               New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up 
               and there's a
 
               loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel 
               are playing
 
               'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! 
               Gimme the sneaker you stupid
 
               idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?

               
                             ELAINE
               Well it's only been three days, I'm 
               sure he's gonna call.
 
               
                             JERRY
               STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) 
               Do you believe this?
 
               Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal 
               in the house!
 
               He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.

               
                             ELAINE
               If only.

               
                             JERRY
               Look at this place. He's going everywhere, 
               I can't go out of the house
 
               at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first 
               night out of
 
               the house since I got back.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, when you walk him, do ya...

               
                             JERRY
               Do I what?

               
                             ELAINE
               Do you pick it up?

               
                             JERRY
               Yes, I pick it up.

               
                             ELAINE
               You pick it up?!?

               
                             JERRY
               Well you have to.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, boy would I love to see that.

               
                             JERRY
               SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to 
               Elaine) I don't know what to
 
               do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows 
               up?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe you should call the airline, they 
               might know where he is.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I tried. they don't know anything. 
               (notices Elaine making egg
 
               creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, milk.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's 
               probably on a bender.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What is a bender anyhow?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, they drink and they bend 
               things at the bar.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I can't believe he hasn't called.

               
                             JERRY
               Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta 
               wind up next to Yukon Jack and his
 
               
               dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!

               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             KRAMER
               Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
                             ELAINE
               We're going to the movies, we're gonna 
               see Prognosis Negative.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out 
               of my life.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You're breaking up?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. 
               I can't wait to do it. You
 
               know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going 
               to hurt their
 
               feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get 
               it on video,
 
               watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer, I don't know how you lasted 
               as long as you did.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Woah, you didn't like her?

               
                             ELAINE
               If you could see her personality it 
               would be like one of the Elephant
 
               
               Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone 
               gasps.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I can't believe someone hasn't killed 
               her yet.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               How come you never said anything?

               
                             JERRY
               You can't tell someone how you feel 
               about their girlfriend until after
 
               
               they stop seeing them.

               
                             KRAMER
               I tell you.

               
                             JERRY
               You. I'm talking about people.

               
                             ELAINE
               Are we still going to the movies tonight?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you 
               and George can go without me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Just me and George?

               
                             JERRY
               Sure.

               
                             ELAINE
               But we need you.

               
                             JERRY
               What do you need me for?

               
               Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

               
                             ELAINE
               Because... Yeah?

               
                             GEORGE
               Prognosis Negative!

               
               Elaine buzzes George into the building.

               
                             ELAINE
               Because I relate to George through you, 
               we're like friends-in-law.
 
               Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. 
               Can't you just
 
               put some newspapers down or something?

               
                             JERRY
               No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. 
               I won't enjoy myself. That's
 
               right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!

               
                             ELAINE
               Just me and George alone?

               
               George enters.

               
                             GEORGE
               Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis 
               Negative time, wa ha ha
 
               ha!!!

               
                             JERRY
               I can't go.

               
                             GEORGE
               Can't go, Why not?

               
                             JERRY
               Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I thought Kramer was watching.

               
                             JERRY
               He's breaking up with his girlfriend 
               tonight.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well so what's the problem, you just 
               put some newspaper down.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I don't want that smell in the house.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You spritz a little Lysol on it.

               
                             JERRY
               No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine 
               forces into some kind of
 
               strange mutant funk.

               
                             GEORGE
               So we're not going?

               
                             JERRY
               Nah. You two go.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh. You still wanna go?

               
                             ELAINE
               Do you?

               
                             GEORGE
               If you want.

               
                             ELAINE
               It's up to you.

               
                             JERRY
               Go ahead.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis 
               Negative with Jerry, uh,
 
               you wanna see Ponce de Leon?

               
                             GEORGE
               Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You 
               sure you don't wanna go?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I want to but I can't.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh! I tell you what. How about if I 
               come back here first and I clean
 
               everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not 
               satisfied we can
 
               switch apartments for the night.

               
                             JERRY
               No.

               
                             GEORGE
               What about this--

               
                             JERRY
               Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good 
               time.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I know, it's not that.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's just we want you to go.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, thank you very much. I'm telling 
               you, one more day stinkbreath!
 
               
               On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see 
               them walking
 
               along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest 
               function of
 
               human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're 
               gonna think
 
               the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's 
               making a
 
               poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume 
               was in charge?
 
               
               New scene.

               George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De 
               Leon. They're
 
               obviously uncomfortable alone together.

               
                             GEORGE
               So how long did you live there?

               
                             ELAINE
               About three years.

               
                             GEORGE
               That's pretty long.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hmm.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's not that long, really.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. 
               They both speak at the same
 
               time, then stop. Another silence.

               
                             GEORGE
               And then you came here.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah. So I've been here about six years.

               I must have been out of my mind. Look 
               at you. Why don't you do
 
               something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute 
               nothing to
 
               society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone 
               like you?
 
               Couldn't respect myself.

               I like herbal tea.

                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, 
               Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has

                             GEORGE
               You don't tell him?

               
                             ELAINE
               No. And you should see him, man, he 
               gets all hyper, he
 
               doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, 
               I feel
 
               great!"

                             GEORGE
               That is so funny!

               
                             ELAINE

               That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are 
               you sure? He was released on
 
               Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? 
               Unbelievable.
 
               Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, 
               Farfel!
 
               Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy

               It was weird because George and I get 
               along so great in so many
 
               situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. 
               Can't pass off.

               The only time it wasn't uncomfortable 
               was when we were making fun of
 
               you.

               
               Jerry (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, 
               how
 
               soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we 
               go right to the
 
               movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am 
               going. Okay,
 
               see you in five minutes.

               Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going 
               to the dog pound, come on
 
               down. (To Elaine) What?

               
                             ELAINE
               Do you have to?

               
                             JERRY
               What am I supposed to do? I don't want 
               to do it. I like dogs. I'm not
 
               sure this is a dog.

               
                             ELAINE
               You know, the guy might have just lost 
               your number.

               Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs 
               at the pound? They keep them
 
               there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.

                             KRAMER
               I went back with Ellen.

               
                             JERRY AND ELAINE
               Ohhhhh, that's great.

               Yeah, I really think you guys are good 
               together.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yes, she understands you and she is 
               not demanding.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Do you think that I forgot what you 
               two said about her?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I was just trying to be supportive, 
               you know. I knew you were upset.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               From now on when we pass each other 
               in the hall, I don't know you, you
 
               
               don't know me.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you doing?

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm getting my pot.

               
               Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer, we like her.

               
                             JERRY
               Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I believe I referred to her personality 
               as a potential science exhibit.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I said, "How come no one's killed her?" 
               Probably shouldn't have said
 
               anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers

               Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, can't you just give it one more 
               day, it's not his fault.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's not my dog, I don't know where 
               this boozehound is.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Alright, I tell you what. How about 
               if you and George go to the
 
               movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.

               
                             JERRY
               I can't let you do that, what about 
               Prognosis Negative?
 
               
                             ELAINE

                             ELAINE
               I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What does this mean?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, we'll go see something else tonight. 
               We'll see, uh, Ponce De
 
               Leon.

               
                             GEORGE
               What is with this dog, I thought we 
               were taking it to the pound.
 
               
                             JERRY
               She talked me into one more day. Talk 
               amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go
 
               to the bathroom.

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, regular human time?

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh why don't you wait then go in the 
               movies?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Why shouldn't I go here?

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's 
               good to get there and make sure
 
               you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.

               
                             GEORGE
               And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, go.

               
                             ELAINE
               Who's stopping you?

               
                             GEORGE
               What, are you doing me a favor?

               
                             ELAINE
               Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
 
               
               
               Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               How's it going?

               
                             ELAINE
               Good. Good. You?

               
                             GEORGE
               Things are good.

               
               After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy 
               off the floor and
 
               squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.

               
                             ELAINE
               Boy, he takes such a long time.

               
                             GEORGE
               I know.

               
                             ELAINE
               You know what he does in there? He gargles.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes 
               so long?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               How come we never hear him?

               
                             ELAINE
               Because he does it quiet. He does it 
               quiet. Lookit, Just like this,
 
               watch.

               
               Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw 
               up?!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               We talked about that already.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh.

               
               New scene.

               Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater.

               
                             GEORGE
               I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm 
               so uninteresting. I think I'm
 
               out of conversation.

               
                             JERRY
               So what are calling me six times a day?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               All I know about is sports. That's it. 
               No matter how depressed I get,
 
               I could always read the sports section.

               
                             JERRY
               I could read the sports section if my 
               hair was on fire.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else 
               is playing?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Boy, I know she really wants to see 
               that with me.
 
               
               New scene.

               Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.

               
                             ELAINE
               Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not 
               Seinfeld you're dealing with!
 
               When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
 
               
               
               The phone rings, Farfel begins barking.

               
                             ELAINE
               Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? 
               No, who's calling? Oh my
 
               god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better 
               pick up your
 
               dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.

               
               Cut back to Jerry and George.

               
                             GEORGE
               I mean, I could understand if there 
               was something else playing, but
 
               it's this or nothing.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know what to do.

               
                             GEORGE
               What is this 'saving movies' thing? 
               Something's playing, you go.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I know, I know.

               
                             GEORGE
               So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, 
               this is crazy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It is kind of silly.

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it is.

               
                             JERRY
               I mean, it's just a movie, for god's 
               sake.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Exactly.

               
                             JERRY
               It's not like she's *in* the movie.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Right.

               
                             JERRY
               Am I supposed to ruin the whole night 
               because she wants to see it? I
 
               mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control 
               all these
 
               circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               And she'll still see it, you're not 
               stopping her from seeing it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How does sitting next to a person in 
               a movie theater increase the level
 
               
               of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is 
               stupid, c'mon,
 
               let's just go.

               
                             GEORGE
               Good.

               
                             JERRY
               Saving movies.

               
                             GEORGE
               Ridiculous!

               
                             JERRY
               Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, you're dead.

               
               New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. 
               Farfel is
 
               barking as loud as ever.

               
                             GAVIN
               Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, 
               of, of my face was paralyzed.
 
               Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, 
               I was completely
 
               incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!

               
                             JERRY
               You know it's interesting, because I 
               called the hospital and they said
 
               
               you were released on Monday.

               
                             GAVIN
               Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was 
               taken to the Bell's Palsy Center
 
               in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top 
               notch physicians.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!

               
                             GAVIN
               He won't hurt you, he's just playing.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
 
               
               
                             GAVIN
               Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more 
               pure than yours.
 
               
                             ELLEN
               Kramer, are you coming?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, hi Ellen.

               
                             ELLEN
               Get in here.

               
               Kramer sulks off.

               
                             JERRY
               Listen, it's really been a pleasure 
               taking care of your dog for a week,
 
               
               but if you don't mind...

               
                             GAVIN
               Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me 
               to ask if you can come and visit
 
               him before the month is out.

               
                             JERRY
               Prediction. I never see you or him again 
               for the rest of my life.
 
               
               Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and 
               out of Jerry's
 
               apartment.

               
               New scene.

               Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment.

               
                             ELAINE
               We made plans.

               
                             JERRY
               Why don't we just rent a movie?

               
                             ELAINE
               I thought you wanted to see Prognosis 
               Negative.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, it's supposed to be really bad, 
               *really* bad. I mean it's long,
 
               there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, George told me the whole story, 
               line for line, I mean I almost
 
               feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him 
               yesterday, he didn't mention it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You and George got together?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we 
               have nothing to talk about.
 
               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             JERRY
               Hello.

               
               Kramer, Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

               
                             JERRY
               What's up?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you were right.

               
                             JERRY
               About what?

               
                             KRAMER
               Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.

               
               
                             JERRY
               Too bad.

               
                             ELAINE
               I thought she was the one.

               
                             KRAMER
               I'll bring back the pot.

               
                             ELAINE
               Okay, c'mon it's movie time.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, what are you gonna see?

               
                             JERRY
               Prognosis Negative.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, that's supposed to be great.

               
                             JERRY
               It's not.

               
                             KRAMER
               How do you know?

               
                             JERRY
               I have an instinct for these things.

               I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that 
               I really enjoyed.
 
               We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and 
               my mother had
 
               built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt 
               this gives you
 
               a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design 
               principle that a
 
               mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What 
               kind of a jerk
 
               walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother 
               room in there.
 
               There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet 
               will fall for
 
               this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, 
               BANG! With his
 
               little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, 
               even if he
 
               thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try 
               to avoid hitting the other parakeet?

               
               
                              THE END

               I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. 
               I mean
 
               between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really 
               need
 
               somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does 
               that really help
 
               you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, 
               tap-tap-tap,
 
               start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, 
               okay, once
 
               it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see 
               the cellist
 
               looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't 
               know what to
 
               do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, okay, 
               thank you very
 
               much."

               
               
               Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.

               
                             GEORGE
               Why even try anymore? There's no sense 
               to it. I'm never gonna meet
 
               anybody, I should just accept it.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, yes you will.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, I won't.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, maybe you won't.

               
                             GEORGE
               I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman 
               you dislike, much less like.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Are my nostrils getting bigger?

               
                             GEORGE
               No. Why must it be so difficult? Why 
               is there all this tension and
 
               hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street 
               and say, "Hi. I'm
 
               George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?

               
               Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers 
               up a meek 'Hi'
 
               which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' 
               a few more times
 
               as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though 
               we was saying that
 
               anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch 
               than read.)
 
               
               
               
               Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another 
               restaurant.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               There's just no men out there, you know?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I know.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               I mean the problem is that the good 
               ones know they're good. And they
 
               know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining 
               themselves
 
               to one person.

               
                             ELAINE
               I hate the good ones.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Is Jerry one of the good ones?

               
                             ELAINE
               That's a good question, I think he thinks 
               he is.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               Well, the mediocre ones are available, 
               but they're so insecure about
 
               not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well 
               I'm not good
 
               enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I 
               just go, "You're
 
               right."

               
                             ELAINE
               You know, maybe you need somebody between 
               good and mediocre.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, 
               somebody who just has to
 
               appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.

               
               
               Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.

               
                             GEORGE
               I mean it's gotten to the point where 
               I'm flirting with operators on
 
               the phone. I almost made a date with one.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, so there's still hope.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. 
               My dream is to become
 
               hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you 
               don't care, that
 
               indifference makes you attractive.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, so hopelessness is the key.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's my only hope.

               
               
               Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               See, I wouldn't really mind so much, 
               but I feel badly for my mother.
 
               I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, 
               I'm telling
 
               you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have 
               to kill her
 
               because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her 
               through that.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, at least you're not bitter.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Who says I'm not bitter?

               
                             ELAINE
               Aren't you too young to be bitter?
 
               
               
                             CYNTHIA
               No, you can be young and bitter, just 
               maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna
 
               be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Don't worry, your bitterness is safe 
               with me.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna 
               go throw up.
 
               
               
               
               Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from 
               the paper. You know, they should
 
               give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               So what'd you do last night?

               
                             JERRY
               Went out with George, you?

               
                             ELAINE
               Went out with Cynthia.

               
                             JERRY
               How was it? What'd you talk about?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, you know, the usual; The Federal 
               Reserve, the rainforest.
 
               Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get 
               rid of it in one
 
               fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. 
               What
 
               about you?

               
                             JERRY
               We brushed on that. Actually, George 
               was in rare form. He just can't
 
               find anybody.

               
                             ELAINE
               I know, Cynthia too. She's really given 
               up.
 
               
                             JERRY
               George too.

               
               They look at each other for a moment.

               
                             JERRY AND ELAINE
               Yeah, right.

               
                             JERRY
               I've never fixed anybody up.

               
                             ELAINE
               Uh, me neither and I am not about to 
               start with George.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well why wouldn't you start with George? 
               You think she's too good for
 
               George?

               
                             ELAINE
               I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too 
               good'?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well you implied it.

               
                             ELAINE
               I didn't say it.

               
                             JERRY
               Because if you think she's too good 
               for George, you are dead wrong.
 
               Dead wrong. Who is she?

               
                             ELAINE
               Who is he?

               
                             JERRY
               He's George!

               
                             ELAINE
               She's Cynthia!

               
                             JERRY
               So what?

               
                             ELAINE
               What, you don't think she's beautiful?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               You know what your problem is? Your 
               standards are too high.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I went out with you.

               
                             ELAINE
               That's because my standards are too 
               low. And by the way, you know,
 
               women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women 
               pluck their
 
               real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, 
               Jerry. Bald
 
               above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look 
               like that.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well let me tell you something about 
               George. He is fast. He can run
 
               like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred 
               pounds over his
 
               head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look 
               at him, but
 
               George can bait a hook.

               
                             ELAINE
               He can really do that?

               
                             JERRY
               Come on, let's do it, I think they'll 
               really get along.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What, are you into this?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're 
               gonna be telling us how
 
               their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?

               
                             JERRY
               Naturally.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell 
               each other everything, I mean
 
               every secret?

               
                             JERRY
               Everything.

               
                             ELAINE
               What if it worked out?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah right.

               
               
               
               Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.

               
                             GEORGE
               Out of the question. Out of the question!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
                             GEORGE
               No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one 
               step away from personal ads!
 
               And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What 
               does she look
 
               like?

               
                             JERRY
               She's good looking.

               
                             GEORGE
               How good looking?

               
                             JERRY
               Very good looking.

               
                             GEORGE
               Really good looking?

               
                             JERRY
               Really very good looking.

               
                             GEORGE
               Would you take her out?

               
                             JERRY
               Yes, I would take her out.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, you hesitated.

               
                             JERRY
               What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!

               
                             GEORGE
               No, something's off here, you hesitated.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I'm telling you, she's good looking.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What about the body, what kind of body?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Good body, nice body.

               
                             GEORGE
               How nice?

               
                             JERRY
               Nice.

               
                             GEORGE
               Just nice?

               
                             JERRY
               Pretty nice.

               
                             GEORGE
               Really good?

               
                             JERRY
               Really very nice and good.

               
                             GEORGE
               What about personality?

               
                             JERRY
               Good personality. Funny. Bright.

               
                             GEORGE
               Smarter than me? I don't want anyone 
               smarter than me.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How could she be smarter than you?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, let's see, let's see. What 
               else. What else. Oh yeah, what
 
               does she do?

               
               
               
               Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               First of all, what does he do?

               
                             ELAINE
               He was in real estate, um, now, he's 
               not working right now-
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               He's not working?! How come he's not 
               working?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, um, he, he got fired.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Why did he get fired?

               
                             ELAINE
               Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried 
               to poison his boss.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               Excuse me?

               
                             ELAINE
               Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, 
               I mean he just had some problems
 
               at work.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Is he nuts?

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, no, he's a really really funny 
               guy.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               What does he look like?

               
                             ELAINE
               Pardon?

               
                             CYNTHIA
               What does he look like?

               
                             ELAINE
               Um, well, he's got a lot of character 
               in his face. Um, he's short.
 
               Um, he's stocky.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Fat. Is that what you're saying, that 
               he's fat?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Powerful. He is so powerful, he can 
               lift a hundred pounds right up
 
               over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, 
               he's kind
 
               of, just kind of losing his hair.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               He's bald?

               
                             ELAINE
               No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's 
               balding.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               So he will be bald.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yup.

               
               
               Cut back to Jerry and George.

               
                             GEORGE
               What kind of hair?

               
                             JERRY
               You know, long dark hair.

               
                             GEORGE
               Flowing?

               
                             JERRY
               Flowing?

               
                             GEORGE
               Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading 
               hair. Thick lustrous hair is
 
               very important to me.

               
                             JERRY
               'Thick lustrous hair is very important 
               to me,' is that what you said?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, that's right.

               
                             JERRY
               Just clarifying.

               
                             GEORGE
               Let me ask you this. If you stick your 
               hand in the hair is it easy to
 
               get it out?

               
                             JERRY
               Do you want to be able to get it out 
               or do you want to not be able to
 
               get it out?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'd like to be able to get it out.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I think you'll get it out.

               
                             GEORGE
               What about the skin? I need a good cheek, 
               I like a good cheek.
 
               
                             JERRY
               She's got a fine cheek.

               
                             GEORGE
               Is there a pinkish hue?

               
                             JERRY
               A pinkish hue?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes, a rosy glow.

               
                             JERRY
               There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, 
               women kill to have her
 
               eyebrows.

               
                             GEORGE
               Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? 
               I like sweet. But not too
 
               sweet, you could throw up from that.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't think you'll throw up. *She* 
               likes to throw up.
 
               
               
               Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Has he ever been married?

               
                             ELAINE
               No.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Has he been close?

               
                             ELAINE
               He once spent a weekend with a woman.
 
               
               
                             CYNTHIA
               He didn't really try to poison his boss?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, he did.

               
               
               
               The next day, George is back at Jerry's.

               
                             GEORGE
               We had an incredible phone conversation. 
               We talked for like twenty
 
               minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You 
               know, I thought
 
               she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?

               
                             JERRY
               I think it's tamber.

               
                             GEORGE
               Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she 
               could do voiceover commercials,
 
               why didn't you tell me about her voice?

               
                             JERRY
               I didn't notice the voice.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's mellifluous!

               
                             JERRY
               So, Saturday night.

               
                             GEORGE
               She had to be impressed by that conversation, 
               had to! It was a great
 
               performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they 
               should just have
 
               two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.

               
               Elaine enters.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hi.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey! Saturday night!

               
                             ELAINE
               I know!

               
                             GEORGE
               So, what did she say?

               
                             ELAINE
               She said you're getting together Saturday 
               night!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               That's it?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah!

               
                             GEORGE
               She didn't mention anything about the 
               conversation?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No.

               
                             GEORGE
               Now, you see, I don't get that. We had 
               a relaxed stimulating, great
 
               conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention 
               it?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               She could have mentioned the conversation.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, 
               but that's that.
 
               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey.

               
                             KRAMER
               You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, the guy from Jersey?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. He just got a job at a condom 
               factory in Edison. Look at this,
 
               he gave me a gross.

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you gonna do with all of them?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. 
               Grab 'em.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No thanks, they look like they came 
               out of a cereal box.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, 
               they look kind of cheap.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I'll take one. It's possible.

               
               
               Mid-episode monologue.

               
               The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we 
               should have like a
 
               secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, 
               you go up
 
               to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) 
               he puts them in
 
               the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little 
               shaving
 
               cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" 
               (nods) "Have a
 
               nice day." "You too."

               
               
               
               Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's 
               date to end.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So where are they already, it's a quarter 
               to twelve, they should be back
 
               by now, what did they do?

               
                             ELAINE
               I think they went out to dinner.

               
                             JERRY
               Wait, I got another call. That must 
               be him. (clicks over) Hello?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, it's me, I just got home.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, hold on. (clicks back) It's George, 
               he just got home.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other 
               line.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Alright, I'll call you back as soon 
               as I'm done.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Of course. (clicks back to George) Yeah, 
               go ahead.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but 
               I made a pact with Cynthia, we
 
               swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.

               
                             JERRY
               You can tell me, I'll vault it.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's in the vault?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm locking the vault. What?

               
                             GEORGE
               We had sex.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh my god, you had sex, how did that 
               happen?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know. I closed my eyes and made 
               a move.
 
               
                             JERRY
               At your apartment?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               She didn't stay over?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, she left. Listen, you can't mention 
               any of this to Elaine.
 
               Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.

               
               Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh my god.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               He was uncomfortable because it was 
               our first time so he felt he would
 
               
               perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen 
               is always the
 
               most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.

               
                             ELAINE
               So? How was it?

               
                             CYNTHIA
               How good could it be? My head was on 
               a hot plate.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Wait, I got another call, that must 
               be Jerry.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, ok. (clicks over) Hello?

               
                             JERRY
               So, what did she have to say?

               
                             ELAINE
               What did he have to say?

               
                             JERRY
               He said they had a good time.

               
                             ELAINE
               Her too.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, good.

               
                             ELAINE
               Anything else?

               
                             JERRY
               Nope. You?

               
                             ELAINE
               Nope.

               
                             JERRY
               You sure?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yup. You?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             ELAINE
               Alright. Well uh, guess everything is 
               under control.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. Okay then.

               
                             ELAINE
               Alright. Goodnight.

               
                             JERRY
               Goodnight.

               
               
               
               Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment.

               
                             GEORGE
               I left three messages. I can't believe 
               this woman. She has sex with
 
               me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. 
               What kind of a
 
               person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What are you gonna do?

               
                             JERRY
               Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting 
               there on the kitchen floor
 
               like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, 
               whatever.
 
               She's not going to get away with this.

               
                             GEORGE
               I keep wracking my brain to try and 
               figure out what I did. I was
 
               smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress 
               so she could see I
 
               could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I'm gonna call her.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, don't call her.

               
                             JERRY
               No, I'm calling her.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, Jerry, don't call.

               
                             JERRY
               No, forget it, I'm gonna call.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't want you to call.

               
                             JERRY
               Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Give me the phone!

               
                             JERRY
               George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna 
               fight?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!

               
               Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, 
               now stop it!
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'll just call her when you leave!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You can't do that, it's none of your 
               business!
 
               
                             JERRY
               It is so my business!

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another 
               word out of either one of
 
               you!

               
               
                             GEORGE
               But tell him to give me the--

               
                             KRAMER
               Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens 
               up your mouth, says
 
               something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet 
               I know what this
 
               is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, but--

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly 
               what they want to do to you. They
 
               
               play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you 
               like that.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But Kramer--

               
                             KRAMER
               Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake 
               hands. Come on, there are
 
               plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.

               
               Jerry and George shake hands.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yes. You see? Isn't that better than 
               fighting? Animosity? I mean,
 
               you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the 
               way George, you
 
               know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               Right.

               
                             GEORGE
               Defective?!

               
                             KRAMER
               Defective.

               
                             GEORGE
               How could you give me a defective condom?!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               I didn't even know they were defective.
 
               
               
               Jerry gets between them to break up the fight.

               
                             KRAMER
               Didn't even thin you were gonna use 
               them.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What do you mean you didn't think I 
               wasn't gonna use them?!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Take it easy, you guys, just spread 
               out! Don't worry about it, if
 
               anything was wrong she would have called you already!

               
               
               
               Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               I missed my period.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh my god.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               I am very worried, I am never late.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               But he used a condom, right?

               
                             CYNTHIA
               I know, but these things aren't always 
               foolproof.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh no.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               What?

               
                             ELAINE
               Was it blue?

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Yeah. How'd you know?

               
                             ELAINE
               Just a hunch.

               
               
               
               Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.

               
                             JERRY
               Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist 
               off!
 
               
               Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, hi. Soda?

               
                             ELAINE
               No thanks.

               
                             JERRY
               So tell me. What's the problem with 
               your little flaky friend? She
 
               doesn't return calls?

               
                             ELAINE
               Who are you to talk about her like that? 
               She'll call him when she's
 
               good and ready. You don't even know her.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, I know her. I know her type.

               
                             ELAINE
               Her type? What type?

               
                             JERRY
               The type that doesn't return phone calls. 
               I knew we shouldn't have done
 
               this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!

               
                             ELAINE
               You told me? You pushed this whole thing 
               on me, it was your idea!
 
               
                             JERRY
               I was just trying to help your bitter, 
               twisted friend.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               She's not bitter!

               
                             JERRY
               Well, bitter's a judgement call, but 
               she's twisted!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Twisted? God, I did you a favor.

               
                             JERRY
               I thought you said they had a good time, 
               is there anything else you're
 
               keeping from me?

               
                             ELAINE
               Are you calling me a liar?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm calling you one if you are one, 
               are you a liar?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Are you?

               
                             JERRY
               Get your finger out of my face.

               
                             ELAINE
               You get yours out, I was here first!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I don't care.

               
                             ELAINE
               Get it out!

               
               Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap 
               fight, and gets
 
               in the middle.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! 
               Come on, break it up! What's the
 
               matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with 
               each other? I
 
               mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around 
               out there looking
 
               for something that's not even there, when everything that you 
               dream of is right
 
               here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? 
               By the way,
 
               when you see George give him these, these'll work.

               
                             ELAINE
               I knew those condoms were defective!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How did you know they were defective?!
 
               
               
               George walks in.

               
                             ELAINE
               Because! Because she missed her period!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               She missed her period? Oh my god. I 
               can't believe it! I'm a father!
 
               I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!

               
               George rushes out, hysterical.

               
               
               
               Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               So he shows up. He's all out of breath. 
               He's disheveled. And he
 
               tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine 
               with him and
 
               that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support 
               me in whatever
 
               way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.

               
                             ELAINE
               Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know 
               somebody.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               I said to him, "I really appreciate 
               this, but I just got my period."
 
               And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--

               
               George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hi!

               
                             GEORGE
               Sorry, we're a little late. We got so 
               hung up in traffic.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What happened?

               
                             JERRY
               Acting.

               
                             ELAINE
               Very mature.

               
                             JERRY
               Thank you. Hi Cynthia.

               
                             CYNTHIA
               Hi.

               
                             JERRY
               Well this is a great place to sit you 
               got here.
 
               
                             CYNTHIA
               Best seat in the house. (Looking at 
               George) right next to the
 
               kitchen.

               
                             GEORGE
               Stop it, stop it.

               
                             JERRY
               So what are these?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start 
               eating.
 
               
               George stars eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. 
               You get the idea
 
               that the relationship has just ended.

               
                             GEORGE
               This is good. Oh, this is good.

               Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought 
               they would
 
               have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? 
               Now, you're
 
               playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people 
               up. He fixed up
 
               Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. 
               She's very free
 
               about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going 
               out with a snake, I think that's over though."

               
               
               
                                    THE END

               You know it's bad enough you have a

               It's safer! Plus it's more annoying 
               to the other person.

                             JERRY
               Oh look at this guy.

               
                             ELAINE
               What's goin' on?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh there's a guy trying to get in front 
               of me, he has to ask
 
               permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.

               
                             ELAINE
               Did you get a thank you wave?

               
                             JERRY
               No, nothing. How could you not give 
               a thank you wave? Hey buddy!
 
               Where's my thank you wave?

               
               (Jerry sticks his head out the window)

                             JERRY
               Give me that wave!

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, are you free on Friday?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I'm free, why?

               
                             ELAINE
               Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky 
               today, she asked me to have
 
               dinner with her and her husband.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh my God! You won't believe what I 
               just saw! A car just bashed into
 
               a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!

               
                             ELAINE
               You gotta follow that car!

               
                             JERRY
               What?!

               
                             ELAINE
               You can't let him get away with that!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What are you, yellow?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're 
               yella.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Wait, he stopped, he's parking.

               
                             ELAINE
               What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
 
               
               
               (Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront 
               other
 
               driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving 
               behind you, uh, a few blocks
 
               back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, 
               I witnessed
 
               that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the 
               performance
 
               of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and 
               pinion
 
               steering. (They both smile flirtatiously at each other)

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are 
               talking by the
 
               table)

                             JERRY
               So I wound up going out for a decaf 
               cappuccino with her.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. 
               I have no speech.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know, I really liked her. We talked. 
               We flirted. And when she
 
               left, she reached out and touched my arm.

               
               (Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate)

                             JERRY
               He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine 
               laugh)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I love when they touch your arm. I can't 
               get enough of that. Why is
 
               that?

               
                             JERRY
               Let's not even analyze it.

               
               (Jerry begins walking towards door)

                             GEORGE
               So you didn't turn her in?

               
                             JERRY
               I wanted to but I couldn't go through 
               with it.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Gonna see her again?

               
                             JERRY
               Friday night.

               
               (Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button)

                             JERRY
               Yep.

               
                             ELAINE
               It's me!

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
               (Jerry unlocks and opens door)

                             JERRY
               By the way, Elaine does not need to 
               know about anything.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, hey, hey! I dig.

               
               (George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups)

                             JERRY
               Oh, you dig?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes! I see enormous potential here.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
               (George pours two cups of milk)

                             GEORGE
               Because great couples always have a 
               great story about how they met.
 
               That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've 
               never had a
 
               good meeting story.

               
                             JERRY
               I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this 
               woman at all.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't think so.

               
                             JERRY
               Look, she slammed into a parked car! 
               She took no responsibility for
 
               mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like 
               a criminal!
 
               
               (Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent)

                             JERRY
               On the other hand, does that mean she 
               should never be allowed to date
 
               again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social 
               contact for
 
               the rest of your life?!

               
               (Jerry looks at his cup in disgust)

                             JERRY
               What am I drinking, milk?

               
               (Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket)

                             ELAINE
               Hey!

               
                             JERRY
               Hi.

               
               (Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry)

                             ELAINE
               Sweater.

               
                             JERRY
               Thank you.

               
                             ELAINE
               So? What happened?

               
               (Jerry starts walking away)

                             JERRY
               With that?

               
                             ELAINE
               With the car!

               
                             JERRY
               What car?

               
                             ELAINE
               The hit and run!

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, right, right, right, right, right, 
               right, right, the hit and run.
 
               Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.

               
                             ELAINE
               Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Over the bridge. (Making a pointing 
               motion with his hand)
 
               
               (George walks out of the kitchen)

                             GEORGE
               Oh, well I didn't know you went into 
               Queens Jerry.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, Queens.

               
                             ELAINE
               So? Then what?

               
                             JERRY
               So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey 
               buddy! I saw you hit that
 
               car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"

               
               (Elaine gasps)

                             JERRY
               So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
 
               
               
               (Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement)

                             ELAINE
               I am speechless. I am without speech.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Tell her about the shoving.

               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
               (George smiles pointing at him)

                             ELAINE
               What shoving?!

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, it was nothing.

               
                             GEORGE
               No! Tell her.

               
               (Jerry looks at George with a grin)

                             JERRY
               Well he kinda lost his temper, and he 
               was pushing me up against the
 
               car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position 
               and does
 
               two punches)

               
                             ELAINE
               You know karate??

               
                             JERRY
               I know a little.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry 
               what did he do?
 
               
                             JERRY
               He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
 
               
               
               (Kramer enters)

                             KRAMER
               Hey! (Group does likewise)

               
                             ELAINE
               Did you tell Kramer?

               
                             JERRY
               Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking 
               away)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What? What? What? Tell me.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, 
               and he followed him.
 
               
               (Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling)

               
                             KRAMER
               Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife 
               would do a thing like
 
               that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. 
               (Pointing
 
               a finger at Jerry)

               
                             KRAMER
               They should be sent to Australia.

               
               (Jerry has a confused look)

                             JERRY
               Australia?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah, that's where England used 
               to send their convicts.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But not any more.

               
                             KRAMER
               No.

               
               (Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer)

                             ELAINE
               Hey Kramer, Kramer!

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah?

               
                             ELAINE
               What happened to you right here? (She's 
               pointing to her forehead)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I don't know!

               
               (Jerry smiles and shakes his head)

                             KRAMER
               You know I was watching Entertainment 
               Tonight, and uh, suddenly I
 
               got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee 
               table.
 
               
               (Elaine has a look of surprise)

                             ELAINE
               Well, that is, that is strange.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yep. (Mumbles off)

               
               (Elaine walks toward door)

                             ELAINE
               Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for 
               Friday night, right?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have 
               a date.
 
               
               (Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry)

                             ELAINE
               But last night you said you were free! 
               (Sounding very disappointed)
 
               
                             JERRY
               We just met.

               
               (Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger)

                             KRAMER
               Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               But I, I can't go alone!

               
                             JERRY
               Ask George to go with you.

               
                             ELAINE
               George, come on! I'll pay for you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You'll pay? I'm there.

               
                             JERRY
               Why do you even need anybody?

               
                             ELAINE
               Because I hate being at a table alone, 
               with a married couple.
 
               Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. 
               They're
 
               always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better 
               than mine.
 
               You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As 
               she's closing
 
               the door to leave)

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married 
               couple,
 
               Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused 
               on eating
 
               his meal)

                             ROBIN
               You went out with a bullfighter?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.

               
                             MICHAEL
               Wow.

               
                             ROBIN
               What was his name?

               
                             ELAINE
               His name? Name, um, his name was uh, 
               uh, Eduardo Carochio.
 
               
               (George points across the table)

                             GEORGE
               Pass the salt please.

               
                             ROBIN
               Where did you meet him?

               
                             ELAINE
               Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, 
               and he was fighting uh, is
 
               that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight 
               the
 
               bull, they avoid fighting the bull.

               
               (Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread)

                             GEORGE
               Bread.

               
               (Elaine hands bread to George)

                             ELAINE
               I just love meeting new people. You 
               know that's how you really do
 
               learn about life.

               
               (Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and 
               looks at
 
               Michael)

                             GEORGE
               God bless you.

               
               (Robin smiles)

                             ROBIN
               Thank you.

               
                             GEORGE
               I wasn't going to say anything, but 
               then I could see that he wasn't
 
               going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)

               
               (Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman 
               are both
 
               eating an ice cream cones)

                             WOMAN
               You know who's a good actor? Anthony 
               Quinn.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from 
               what I understand, not a very
 
               good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a 
               note.
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

               
                             JERRY
               Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he 
               never felt so good as when he
 
               left a note after smacking into a car.

               
               (Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling)

                             WOMAN
               Come here.

               
               
               
               (Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed 
               between
 
               Michael and George)

                             GEORGE
               Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
 
               
               
                             ROBIN
               He was only joking Michael.

               
               (Michael throws down his serviette)

                             MICHAEL
               You think you're so damn special because 
               you say 'God bless you'?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No, no, I don't think I'm special. My 
               mother always said I'm not
 
               special.

               
                             ROBIN
               He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
 
               
               
                             MICHAEL
               All right! Take his side!

               
                             ROBIN
               I am not taking his side.

               
                             MICHAEL
               Well who's side are you taking?!

               
                             ROBIN
               Well I'm not taking your side!

               his)
 
               
               
               
               (Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run 
               woman are
 
               now kissing)

                             JERRY
               Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very 
               bad driver. But he's such an
 
               unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even 
               leave a note.
 
               He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up 
               so he can
 
               exchange license, registration, and apologize.

               
               (Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)

               
               
               
               (Scene moves back to Jerry apartment with George talking outside 
               Jerry room,
 
               where Jerry is)

                             GEORGE
               I said 'God bless you'. Was that so 
               wrong?
 
               
                             JERRY
               The question is, did you allow a space 
               for the husband to come in
 
               with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the 
               right to first
 
               refusal.

               
               (George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks 
               over and
 
               presses the button)

                             ELAINE
               It's me.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
               (Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen)

                             GEORGE
               Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let 
               me say this: Once he passes
 
               on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.

               
                             JERRY
               No argument. Unless, she's one of these 
               multiple sneezers, and he's
 
               holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes 
               the series.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well I don't think she is a multiple 
               sneezer, because she sneezed
 
               again later, and it was also a single.

               
                             JERRY
               What if she's having an off night?
 
               
               
               (Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa)

               Hi!

               
               Jerry. Hi.

               
               (Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen)

                             ELAINE
               Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
 
               
               
               (George walks out of kitchen)

                             GEORGE
               Oh ya, like there's something wrong 
               with saying 'God bless you'. I
 
               was raised to say 'God bless you'.

               
               (Jerry sneezes)

                             GEORGE
               Ah, shut up.

               
                             ELAINE
               What does it mean anyway? 'God bless 
               you'. It's a stupid
 
               'stuperstition'.

               
               (Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa)

                             JERRY
               A stupid what?

               
               (Elaine looks at Jerry)

                             ELAINE
               Whatever.

               
                             JERRY
               You know, if you want to make a person 
               feel better after they sneeze,
 
               you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo 
               good
 
               lookin''.

               
               (Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes)

                             ELAINE
               Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God 
               bless you'. Anyway, she left a
 
               message on my machine, she wants you to call her.

               
                             GEORGE
               Who?

               
                             ELAINE
               Robin!

               
               (George looks quickly at Elaine)

                             GEORGE
               Why?!

               
                             ELAINE
               Well I assumed she called to apologize, 
               that's why she called me.

               Where's the remote phone?

               
                             JERRY
               Bedroom.

               
               (George walks toward Jerry's bedroom)

                             ELAINE
               Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would 
               you?
 
               
               (Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and 
               Elaine, then
 
               walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice 
               of Mary Hart
 
               starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the 
               sofa.)
 
                             JERRY
               What's it like out?

               
               (Kramer continues to shake behind sofa)

                             ELAINE
               Chilly out.

               
                             JERRY
               Can I take a sweater?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, you can take a sweater if you 
               want to.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Scarf?

               
                             ELAINE
               Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
 
               
               
               (Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes)

                             JERRY
               What's the matter? What's going on?
 
               
               
               (Kramer is looking around like he's lost)

                             KRAMER
               What happened?!

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               I think I hit my head again!

               
                             JERRY
               What is wrong?!

               
               (Elaine is pointing at the TV)

                             ELAINE
               Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask 
               you something. Kramer, the last
 
               time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah.

               
               (Elaine claps her hands together then stands up)

                             ELAINE
               That is it!

               
                             KRAMER
               What?

               
               (Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him)

                             ELAINE
               That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't 
               you see? There's something
 
               about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, 
               just like,
 
               just like that woman in Albany!

               
               (George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits 
               down)
 
                             KRAMER
               Mary Hart!

               
                             GEORGE
               God.

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               Well she apologized, and then she wanted 
               to know if we could get
 
               together Wednesday afternoon.

               
                             JERRY
               Get together?

               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Married women don't 'get together'. 
               They have affairs.
 
               
               (George walks to other side of sofa)

                             GEORGE
               Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. 
               It's like with stockings and
 
               martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't 
               cost me
 
               any money.

               
               (George sits on chair)

                             ELAINE
               Are you actually considering this?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't have an affair with a married 
               woman, that's despicable!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving 
               away without leaving a
 
               note.

               
               (Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable)

                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
               (Kramer walks out of washroom)

                             KRAMER
               Hey, you know who owns that car?

               
                             JERRY
               What car?

               
                             KRAMER
               The one that was hit a couple of nights 
               ago.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah who?

               
                             KRAMER
               That blond across the street. You know 
               the one with the long
 
               ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.

               
               (Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen)

                             JERRY
               The blond with the blue sweatpants! 
               Yeah, I think I've seen her.
 
               
               (Elaine nods, smiling)

                             ELAINE
               Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting 
               a guy with grey sweatpants.
 
               
               (Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows)

                             KRAMER
               Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's 
               not John Tesh?
 
               
               (Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very 
               excited)
 
                             JERRY
               The blond with the blue sweatpants!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, who is she?

               
                             JERRY
               I've had a crush on this woman for year! 
               I've always been afraid to
 
               approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark 
               cards.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! 
               Gees, it's too bad you can't
 
               say anything because of Angela.

               
               (Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. 
               I mean what kind of sick person
 
               does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, 
               I actually
 
               owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by 
               and allow this
 
               to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!

               
               (Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You can't compromise your principles!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How am I going to live with myself?!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Can't live!

               
                             JERRY
               I'm not religious, but I certainly know 
               where to draw the line!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               This country needs more people like 
               you!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Don't sell yourself short saying 'God 
               bless you' to every Tom, Dick
 
               and Harry in great personal risk.

               
                             GEORGE
               I believe strongly in that as you know.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               There should be more people like us.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               That's why the world's in the shape 
               it's in.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You're telling me.

               
               (Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading 
               their
 
               magazines)

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking 
               to the girl
 
               with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door)

                             JERRY
               Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that 
               I'm going to do everything I
 
               can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible 
               or
 
               something very close to that.

               
               (Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling)

                             BECKY
               Well God bless you.

               
               (Jerry pauses)

                             JERRY
               Thank you very much.

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are 
               together in
 
               bed)

                             GEORGE
               Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have 
               I done?
 
               
                             ROBIN
               Oh no, what's wrong?

               
                             GEORGE
               What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. 
               I just committed adultery!
 
               
                             ROBIN
               You didn't commit adultery, I did.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh yeah.

               
                             ROBIN
               If I didn't do it with you, I would 
               have done it with someone else.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. 
               You know there's a lot of
 
               losers out there.

               
                             ROBIN
               Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God 
               bless you'.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, that's a given.

               
                             ROBIN
               In three years with Michael, not one 
               'God bless you'.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Must be hell living in that house.
 
               
               
               
               
               (Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the 
               phone to
 
               Michael)

                             MICHAEL
               Hi, it's Michael.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hi, Michael!

               
                             MICHAEL
               Is Robin there?

               
                             ELAINE
               Robin? No, why?

               
                             MICHAEL
               Uh, she said she was going to be with 
               you.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, 
               yeah right, um, as a matter
 
               of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't 
               here, but I
 
               have the note, uh, right here.

               
               (Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)
 
               
                             MICHAEL
               If she's not with you, then where is 
               she?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well I, I don't know.

               
                             MICHAEL
               Is she with your bald friend from the 
               other night?!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, come on Michael!

               
                             MICHAEL
               He's finished! I'm going to sew his 
               ass to his face! I'm going to
 
               twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going 
               to break his
 
               joints, and reattach them!

               
               (Michael sneezes)

                             ELAINE
               You're soo good lookin'.

               
               
               
               (Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela 
               are talking
 
               by the sofa)

                             ANGELA
               Now you listen to me, suck face! You 
               tell anybody, anything, and I
 
               will carve my initials in your brain tissue!

               
                             JERRY
               Let me rephra-

               
                             ANGELA
               I'll bash your skull into a vegematic 
               like a bad cabbage, and I'll
 
               have a party on your head!

               
               (Elaine walks in)

                             JERRY
               Hi Elaine, this is Angela.

               
                             ANGELA
               I'll pluck all your body hairs out with 
               my teeth!
 
               
               (Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen)

                             JERRY
               Well I think I get the gist of it.
 
               
               
                             ANGELA
               So you don't say anything to anybody 
               about me hitting that car!
 
               
               (Jerry shrugs)

                             JERRY
               What car?

               
               (Jerry hands Angela her purse)

                             ANGELA
               Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's not complicated.

               
               (Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves)

                             ELAINE
               Very nice meeting you!

               
               (Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Come on up.

               
               (Elaine laughs)

                             ELAINE
               Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That 
               must have been so frightening!
 
               When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see 
               if I've got
 
               this scenario right.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright Elaine.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 
               'French Connection', kind
 
               of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the 
               city!
 
               
                             JERRY
               It was just a couple of blocks.

               
               (Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter)

                             ELAINE
               Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
 
               
               
               (George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward 
               him, Jerry
 
               goes to washroom)

                             GEORGE
               Hey.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, did you check you machine?

               
               (George takes glass from cupboard)

                             GEORGE
               No, why, what's happening?

               
                             ELAINE
               Michael called me today, and he asked 
               me where Robin was.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, okay.

               
                             ELAINE
               And I said I hadn't seen her.

               
                             GEORGE
               What?!

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no George! You don't understand! 
               She didn't tell me she was
 
               using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going 
               on, and I
 
               said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. 
               And then, and
 
               then he did mention your name.

               
                             GEORGE
               He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               He said he was going to sew your ass 
               to your face.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well I don't know, he caught me off 
               guard!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You lie! How hard is it to lie?!

               
               (Jerry walks back from washroom)

                             JERRY
               It's not that hard.

               
               (Elaine points finger at George)

                             ELAINE
               Well who told you to sleep with her 
               George?!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               It's not my fault! I wasn't going to 
               do anything until you got her
 
               all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the 
               matador!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh Gosh! None of this would never have 
               happened if you wouldn't have
 
               said 'God bless you'!

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh don't-

               
               (Jerry raises his arms)

                             JERRY
               Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? 
               What matador?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               She told this couple she had an affair 
               with a matador.
 
               
                             JERRY
               A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento 
               por favor. Pray tell, what
 
               was the young man's name?

               
                             ELAINE
               Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.

               
               (Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador)

                             JERRY
               Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's 
               very good. Kind of just rolls
 
               of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single 
               girl might
 
               meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Ray's Pizza!

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to 
               her outside her
 
               door)

                             JERRY
               Anyway, this person told me to tell 
               you to get an estimate on the
 
               damage.

               
                             BECKY
               Well, I already got an estimate. It's 
               $875.
 
               
                             JERRY
               $875?

               
                             BECKY
               That's right.

               
                             JERRY
               Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll 
               give you a check, and then
 
               this person can pay me back.

               
               (Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing)

                             JERRY
               Um, who do I make it out to?

               
                             BECKY
               Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

               
                             JERRY
               So, what are you doing this weekend?
 
               
               
               (Jerry hands check to Becky)

                             BECKY
               You have got some nerve! You smash up 
               my car, you don't admit it, and
 
               now you want to ask me out on a date?

               
                             JERRY
               I didn't do it!

               
                             BECKY
               Yeah righ-

               
               (Becky sneezes)

                             JERRY
               You are soo good lookin'.

               
               (Becky closes door)

                             BECKY
               Thank you.

               
               
               
               (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in 
               bedroom and
 
               George is looking out window)

                             GEORGE
               Jerry, let's go! You ready?

               
               (Jerry walks out of bedroom)

                             JERRY
               You sure you want to do this? I'm going 
               to be on the road for three
 
               weeks!

               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking 
               me, I'm not staying in the
 
               city.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright!

               
               (George put his bag over his shoulder)

                             GEORGE
               Come on let's get out of here.

               
               (Kramer enters)

                             KRAMER
               How could you?

               
                             JERRY
               What?!

               
                             KRAMER
               Man! I never thought you were capable 
               of this!
 
               
                             JERRY
               What did I do?

               
                             KRAMER
               I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, 
               she told me how you hit and
 
               ran.

               
                             JERRY
               I-

               
                             KRAMER
               I don't even want to look at you anymore! 
               All these years of
 
               friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment 
               to the
 
               building.

               
                             JERRY
               I didn't do it! I just had to pay her 
               to cover for somebody else!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Now you're not going to lie to me, are 
               you?
 
               
               (Jerry is putting on sweater)

                             JERRY
               No, never.

               
                             KRAMER
               Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened 
               out because I've got a
 
               date with her.

               
                             JERRY
               You got a date with Becky Gelke?!

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry, can we get out of here?!

               
                             KRAMER
               As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for 
               you, I wouldn't have even had
 
               an excuse to talk to her.

               
                             JERRY
               Well I'm happy to help, in any way that 
               I can.
 
               
               (Jerry yanks coat out of George's hands)

               
               
               
               
                            THE END
                              THE KEYS

               So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day 
               and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need 
               keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the 
               ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, 
               maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics 
               looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did 
               it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they 
               don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, 
               we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, 
               I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys 
               to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running 
               underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're 
               actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe 
               he left it up there somewhere..."
 
               
                             OPENING SCENE
               Jerry's apartment in the middle of the 
               night. Jerry comes out of his room. 
               We hear his thoughts.
 
               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               What is it about sleep that makes you 
               so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? 
               It's not like I'm running a marathon, 
               I'm just lying there.
 
               
               (Jerry notices his door is open.)

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               What the hell...? Why is the door open?
 
               
               
               (Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, 
               and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns 
               on the light.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer, what are you doing here!?

               
                             KRAMER
               Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm 
               sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! 
               Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds 
               Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted 
               to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used 
               the spare keys that you gave me to come 
               into your apartment to get your popper.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You scared me!

               
                             KRAMER
               It's just me.

               
                             JERRY
               That's enough!

               
                             KRAMER
               Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, 
               grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles 
               it around, then exits.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Jerry's apartment, daytime. We hear Jerry hurriedly 
               trying to get in the door.
 
               
                             JERRY
               C'mon...c'mon...

               
               (Jerry enters, sheds his jacket, drops his luggage and heads 
               for the bathroom. He opens the door to find Kramer taking a bubble 
               bath in his tub.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer! What are you doing?!

               
                             KRAMER
               What does it look like I'm doing? What?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I 
               gotta go!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Alright, alright...

               
                             JERRY
               C'mon!

               
                             KRAMER
               Sorry.

               
                             JERRY
               Move it! Move it! Get going!

               
                             KRAMER
               My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out 
               of the bathroom in a towel, covered 
               in soap suds.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Is that my towel?

               
               (Kramer loses the towel in the hallway and throws it on Jerry's 
               floor from the other side of the door.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Jerry's hallway at night. Jerry approaches his door 
               with a girlfriend.
 
               
                             GIRLFRIEND
               I'm really happy the movie was sold 
               out.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, 
               murderers chasing you, and you try and 
               see how fast you can get your keys out 
               and get into your apartment?
 
               
                             GIRLFRIEND
               I'm from Witchita, so...

               
                             JERRY
               Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the 
               murderers are coming.)
 
               
                             GIRLFRIEND
               Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!

               
                             JERRY
               The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door 
               and they both run inside.)
 
               
                             GIRLFRIEND
               That was close!

               
                             JERRY
               Did you see the look on that guy's face?
 
               
               
                             GIRLFRIEND
               You were so fast with those keys. (They 
               prepare to kiss, but are interrupted 
               by Kramer and his girlfriend coming 
               out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and 
               horsing around.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer! What the hell are you doing 
               here?!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you 
               were going to the movies.
 
               
                             JERRY
               All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               What, you know what, the keys. I want 
               the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, come on!

               
                             JERRY
               No, come on!

               
                             KRAMER
               What, what, I thought you went to the 
               movies!
 
               
                             JERRY
               It was sold out!

               
                             KRAMER
               Now how was I supposed to know it was 
               going to be sold out?
 
               
                             JERRY
               That's the point.

               
                             KRAMER
               What point?

               
                             JERRY
               Just, look, just give the keys.

               
                             KRAMER
               Just give me another chance!

               
                             JERRY
               Don't ask me!

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm asking you!

               
                             JERRY
               I'm telling you.

               
                             KRAMER
               You're joking.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm serious!

               
                             KRAMER
               It's not going to happen again!

               
                             JERRY
               Yes it will, now give me those keys!
 
               
               
               (Jerry and Kramer begin struggling over the keys. Kramer loses 
               his footing and falls on the floor, taking his girlfriend down 
               with him.)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! 
               But you're going to regret this. (He 
               angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters 
               seconds later when he realizes he's 
               left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Jerry's apartment, the next day. Jerry is now giving 
               his spare keys to Elaine.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So put 'em in a safe place.

               
                             ELAINE
               I will.

               
                             JERRY
               Where?

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is 
               Kramer upset?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I think so. I mean, he's acting really 
               weird lately...he's different.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, maybe you should just give him 
               the keys back.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I can't.

               
               (There's a gentle knock at the door.)

               
                             ELAINE
               Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)

               
                             JERRY
               Who's there?

               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer 
               enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with 
               the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you 
               got the...
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I'm not, uh...

               
                             KRAMER
               No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about 
               the keys. It's my fault. I gave the 
               keys away with my stupidity. I broke 
               "the covenant of the keys."
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, give him the keys back.

               
                             JERRY
               Elaine...

               
               (Elaine tries to give the keys to Kramer, but Jerry won't let 
               her. Jerry and Elaine begin struggling over the keys. Kramer 
               breaks it up.)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I don't want the keys back! No, I'm 
               glad the way things turned out. I was 
               clingin' to those keys, man! Like a 
               branch on the banks of a raging river. 
               And now I have let go. And I'm free...to 
               go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) 
               And I thank you.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Take the keys.

               
                             KRAMER
               I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries 
               to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer 
               refuses.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               O.K.!

               
                             KRAMER
               Now, one more thing - I would like my 
               keys back.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Your spare set?

               
                             KRAMER
               That's right.

               
                             JERRY
               You want 'em back?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for 
               the best.
 
               
               (Jerry takes a huge ring with hundreds of keys on it out of his 
               drawer, and hands it to Kramer. Kramer begins going through them.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene at the coffee shop. Kramer is now giving the huge keyring 
               to George.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what 
               to say.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!

               
                             GEORGE
               Should I give you my keys, is that the 
               transaction, trading keys...? Because 
               Elaine has my keys.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you can get 'em back.

               
                             GEORGE
               I suppose I could.

               
                             KRAMER
               Because you see, George, having the 
               keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept 
               me in a fantasy world. Every time I 
               went over to his house, it was like 
               I was on vacation. Better food, better 
               view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much 
               cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored 
               the squalor in my own life because I'm 
               looking at life, you see, through Jerry's 
               eyes. I was living in twilight, George. 
               Living in the shadows. Living in the 
               darkness...like you.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Me?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' 
               me out. (The waitress comes over.)
 
               
               
                             WAITRESS
               Hi, are you ready to order? (George 
               tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Do you ever yearn?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yearn? Do I yearn?

               
                             KRAMER
               I yearn.

               
                             GEORGE
               You yearn.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I 
               sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, not recently. I craved. I crave 
               all the time, constant craving...but 
               I haven't yearned.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Look at you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Aw, Kramer, don't start...

               
                             KRAMER
               You're wasting your life.

               
                             GEORGE
               I am not! What you call wasting, I call 
               living! I'm living my life!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you 
               have a job?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             KRAMER
               You got money?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             KRAMER
               Do you have a woman?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             KRAMER
               Do you have any prospects?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             KRAMER
               You got anything on the horizon?

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh...no.

               
                             KRAMER
               Do you have any action at all?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             KRAMER
               Do you have any conceivable reason for 
               even getting up in the morning?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I like to get the Daily News!

               
                             KRAMER
               George, it's time for us to grow up 
               - and be men. Not little boys.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why?

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm goin' to California. You know, I 
               got the bug.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, 
               too.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               No, the acting bug. Ever since I was 
               in that Woody Allen movie.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? 
               That was one line! You got fired!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               I know, I know, but man! I never felt 
               so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, no, I'm not.

               
                             KRAMER
               Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep 
               this between us - we're key brothers 
               now. (Gets up to leave.)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You're not really gonna go to California, 
               are you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene, Elaine's apartment at night. George is picking up 
               his spare keys from Elaine.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, 
               now he wants to have my keys, so I need 
               mine back from you.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does 
               he need yours?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know. He said he wants to be 
               my "key brother."
 
               
                             ELAINE
               That's ridiculous.

               
                             GEORGE
               That's Kramer.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'll give you back your spare keys - 
               but now I want mine back.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What for?

               
                             ELAINE
               'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry? Why?

               
                             ELAINE
               'Cause he gave me his.

               
                             GEORGE
               So what?

               
                             ELAINE
               So, if he has my keys, I should have 
               his.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I don't see why if you have his, 
               he should have yours.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I just said the same thing to you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, listen, I'll give you your 
               spare keys, but I don't have them with 
               me. Can I please have mine to give to 
               back to Kramer?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George 
               begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's 
               counter.) What are you doing? Would 
               you just put that down? (Takes the papers 
               away from George.) I gotta get some 
               new friends.
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene, Jerry's apartment the next day.

               
                             JERRY
               Did you bring the keys?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes, but I still don't feel right about 
               letting you into Kramer's apartment 
               without his permission.
 
               
                             JERRY
               This could be an emergency!

               
                             GEORGE
               You never should have taken away his 
               keys!
 
               
                             JERRY
               I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't 
               take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into 
               the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               How'd the Mets do?

               
                             JERRY
               They lost.

               
               (Jerry and George open Kramer's door and poke their heads in.)
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer?

               
               (Newman walks up behind them.)

               
                             NEWMAN
               Hello, boys.

               
                             JERRY
               Hello, Newman.

               
                             NEWMAN
               You lookin' for someone?

               
                             JERRY
               Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm 
               not in the mood!
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Coy? I'm not being coy.

               
                             JERRY
               Is he being coy?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, coy.

               
                             JERRY
               You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, 
               Newman?
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Who?

               
                             JERRY
               Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer 
               is and wanna know now!
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. 
               I got witnesses.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Turn around, George.

               
                             GEORGE
               Sure. (Turns around.)

               
                             NEWMAN
               George?

               
                             JERRY
               Now, you better tell me where Kramer 
               is, or are we gonna have to do this 
               the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               Help! Help!

               
                             JERRY
               Where's Kramer?

               
                             NEWMAN
               HELP! (Elaine enters.)

               
                             ELAINE
               What's going on?

               
               (Newman grabs Elaine and hides behind her.)

               
                             NEWMAN
               They're gonna beat me up!

               
                             GEORGE
               No we're not.

               
                             JERRY
               We're trying to find out what happened 
               to Kramer.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               You wanna know what happened to Kramer? 
               I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. 
               He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, 
               that's right - about the keys. Thought 
               he got a bad rap.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Bad rap?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Yeah. From you.

               
                             JERRY
               Me?

               
                             NEWMAN
               You heard me. So he packed it up and 
               split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               L.A.?

               
               (Cut to Kramer in his car on the highway, listening to rock music. 
               The car's engine starts to fail, then stalls. Kramer can't believe 
               it.)
 
               
               
               
               Commercial break.

               
               
               
               
               
               New scene, Jerry's apartment at night (Jerry's at the window, 
               George and Elaine are on the couch).
 
               
                             JERRY
               I never should have taken his keys away. 
               But he drove me to it! I had no choice! 
               He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you 
               saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the 
               keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. 
               You saw it, didn't you see it?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under 
               her breath) I mean, it's complete bullsh*t.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Huh?

               
                             ELAINE
               What...?

               
                             JERRY
               No, what'd you say?

               
                             ELAINE
               Nothing. I didn't say anything.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, you didn't see it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw 
               it. Yep.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I heard you say something, there.

               
                             ELAINE
               I didn't say anything.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks 
               up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I 
               don't know what you said. But it was 
               something. I heard something. Hello? 
               Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could 
               you turn the music down? Could you turn 
               the music down!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Ask her about Kramer.

               
                             JERRY
               She's drunk out of her mind.

               
               (Cut back to Kramer with his car broken down on the side of the 
               highway. He tries to thumb a ride.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene, Jerry approaching his apartment door. He tries to 
               unlock it, but realizes Elaine has his keys. Jerry goes to the 
               coffee shop to call Elaine.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm 
               locked out of my apartment, I need my 
               spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the 
               coffee shop.
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch a ride on the back of a 
               motorcycle.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey! You ever been in an accident?
 
               
               
                             BIKER
               About five years ago. I was going down 
               this very road. Same time of day, going 
               about the same speed I'm going now...there 
               was a rock in the road. Couldn't have 
               been more than a pebble. Never really 
               saw it! Lost control of the bike, went 
               flyin' about a hundred feet - came down 
               right on my head. Cracked it wide open! 
               Blood and stuff was just splattered 
               all over the road, there...I broke every 
               bone in my face. Hey, you know, when 
               they found me, my eyes were hanging 
               out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced 
               me dead at the scene. I was in a coma 
               for...well, they told me about a year...said 
               I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but 
               I showed 'em. Ever since then I always 
               wear a helmet! (The biker goes into 
               a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Jerry in a booth at the coffee shop waiting for George. 
               George enters, spare keys in hand.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Georgie Boy! Way to come through with 
               the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' 
               about it, I just don't feel right about 
               letting you into Elaine's apartment.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Don't feel right? What are you talking 
               about?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, you know, I shouldn't have let 
               you into Kramer's, now you want to go 
               into Elaine's...she entrusted me with 
               her spare keys, how can I just let you 
               in?
 
               
                             JERRY
               What is the big deal?

               
                             GEORGE
               Just because you have someone's spare 
               keys, it doesn't entitle you to break 
               into their apartment. That's the reason 
               you took away Kramer's keys.
 
               
                             JERRY
               First of all, you're not even supposed 
               to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed 
               to give 'em back to her, so she can 
               give 'em back to me, because she has 
               mine. So technically, those are my keys.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Yes, well, if you had never taken your 
               keys back from Kramer, he never would 
               have taken his back from you and given 
               'em to me, in which case I wouldn't 
               have had to take mine back from her.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab 
               the keys from George.)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Nope, no can do.

               
                             JERRY
               George, give them to me, I want these 
               keys. (They struggle over the keys.) 
               I don't want to get physical!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Do you wanna fight?

               
                             JERRY
               Do you wanna fight?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the 
               face! (The struggle continues.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch another ride, this time 
               with a van full of drugged-out hippies. Kramer is telling them 
               a story as they go down the road...
 
               
                             KRAMER
               And then, the evil ogre took back the 
               magical keys from the handsome young 
               prince.
 
               
                             HIPPIE #1
               Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, 
               no way.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yes! And then the handsome young prince 
               was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
 
               
               
                             HIPPIE #1
               Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's 
               pretty cold, huh?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, he's cold.

               
                             HIPPIE #1
               Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If 
               that ogre dude pulled that crap on me 
               (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! 
               I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE 
               A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) 
               Hey, you can drop me here!
 
               
                             HIPPIE #1
               Hey, what's the rush, man?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
 
               
               
                             HIPPIE #1
               Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a 
               man?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What do you think, junior? You think 
               these hands have been soakin' in Ivory 
               liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
 
               
               
                             HIPPIE #2
               Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You 
               know so much about the world, we need 
               you, please Kramer! (they all start 
               chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! 
               (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape 
               their clutches.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene, Elaine's building at night. Jerry and George approach 
               Elaine's door, still arguing about the keys.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Don't you see? You're just avoiding 
               the middle man. You were gonna give 
               her her spare keys, so she was gonna 
               give 'em to me. So, all that's happening 
               is that instead of giving them to her, 
               you're giving them to me. It's just 
               unfortunate that when she gave you yours, 
               you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then 
               she would have given 'em to me, because 
               she has mine. So then I would have never 
               had to ask you for hers, so that I could 
               get mine.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins 
               unlocking the door, mutters under his 
               breath) Maybe because it's a crock of 
               sh*t.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What's that?

               
                             GEORGE
               Nothing.

               
                             JERRY
               I heard something.

               
                             GEORGE
               Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's 
               apartment.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch yet another ride, this time 
               with a woman driving an eighteen-wheeler.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
 
               
               
                             WOMAN
               Goin' on four years.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind 
               the wheel of a semi.
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then 
               laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite 
               the sweet-talker.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You know, I always wanted to drive the 
               big rigs. I used to watch those commercials 
               during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
 
               
                             WOMAN
               You want to give it a try?

               
                             KRAMER
               Really?

               
                             WOMAN
               Do you know how to double-clutch?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah.

               
                             WOMAN
               Well, come on! (They trade places and 
               Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer 
               turns out to be really rusty on the 
               ol' double-clutch.)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               New scene, Jerry and George in Elaine's apartment looking for 
               Jerry's spare keys.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               They were in here, I saw her put 'em 
               in here!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, this is great.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, what do they look like?

               
                             JERRY
               They look like keys, George. They look 
               exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What 
               do they look like."
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, they're obviously not here.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette 
               and a hidden wall opens up, we have 
               checked every square inch of this apartment!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What is this? "Murphy Brown"?

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               By Elaine Benes?

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Wait a second! (They fight over the 
               paper.)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Gimme half!

               
                             JERRY
               All right, here!

               
                             GEORGE
               Why didn't she tell us?

               
                             JERRY
               Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine 
               enters the room behind Jerry and George. 
               Jerry spots her and tosses his half 
               of the script at George. George throws 
               it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               You weasels!

               
                             JERRY
               What? What?

               
                             ELAINE
               How dare you!

               
                             GEORGE
               We hardly read anything!

               
                             JERRY
               It was funny!

               
                             ELAINE
               Who gave you permission to come into 
               my house and just go through all my 
               things? You thought it was funny?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well... (picks up some of the pages) 
               From what I saw...
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, it's just a first draft!

               
                             JERRY
               I was locked out of my apartment, I'm 
               just trying to get my keys.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               He forced me to!

               
                             JERRY
               I did not!

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes you did!

               
                             ELAINE
               You! Get out! Get out! Get out!

               
                             JERRY
               Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 
               'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Good!

               
                             ELAINE
               And I want my keys back from you!

               
                             GEORGE
               What, you don't want me to hold your 
               keys?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, you can't be trusted!

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys 
               to Elaine.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               And I don't want you to hold mine!
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Good! I won't!

               
                             JERRY
               Good! Don't! Are these my keys?

               
                             ELAINE
               These aren't my keys!

               
                             GEORGE
               Whose are these?

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know!

               
               (Meanwhile, Kramer's finally made it to Los Angeles. He's shown 
               roller-skating through traffic, and nearly running over some 
               guy on a scooter.)

               New scene, Jerry and Elaine watching "Murphy Brown" in Jerry's 
               apartment.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I just thought I could write it.

               
                             JERRY
               Is that something you want to do?

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know. Those writers make a lot 
               of money.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine, let me tell you something about 
               show business. It's hard work! You don't 
               just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta 
               watch the show, study it, get a sense 
               of the characters, how they relate to 
               each other.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters 
               under her breath) God, what an asshole.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What did you say?

               
                             ELAINE
               I didn't say anything.

               
                             JERRY
               I heard something. (Looks at the TV) 
               Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's 
               on "Murphy Brown"!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!

               
                             JERRY
               Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the 
               desk!

               Oh - I'm familiar with it.

               (laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? 
               I can't do this if you keep
 
               
               moving.

               
                             KRAMER
               You sure you don't want me to take my 
               clothes off? (beat) I'll do it!
 
               
                             NINA
               No, that's the last thing in the world 
               I want you to do.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well, why don't you take your clothes 
               off?
 
               
                             NINA
               I don't know... I don't think Jerry 
               would like that.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               (debonair smile) Well, it'd be our little 
               secret.

                             GEORGE
               (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling 
               with his fly) Button fly!
 
               
               Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get 
               these
 
               
               things open!

               
                             JERRY
               I like the button fly.

               
                             GEORGE
               (incredulous) What?

               
                             JERRY
               That is one place on my wardrobe I do 
               not need sharp interlocking
 
               
               metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are 
               you
 
               
               doing today?

               
                             GEORGE
               Nothing.

               
                             JERRY
               I have to go meet Nina. Want to come 
               up to her lot, check out her
 
               
               paintings?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't get art.

               
                             JERRY
               There's nothing to get.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, it always has to be explained 
               to me, and then I have to have
 
               
               someone explain the explanation.

               
                             JERRY
               She does a lot of abstract stuff. In 
               fact she's painting Kramer
 
               
               right now.

               
                             GEORGE
               What for?

               
                             JERRY
               She sees something in him.

               
                             GEORGE
               So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a 
               wall.

                             KRAMER
               Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're 
               brown. (beat) Or, really,
 
               
               they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.

               
                             NINA
               Tell me about Elaine.

               
                             KRAMER
               She and Jerry were a big thing, like 
               Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
 
               
                             NINA
               But, they're still friends.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up 
               two fingers together).
 
               
                             NINA
               Don't you think that's strange?

               
                             KRAMER
               Why, what's the difference?

               
                             NINA
               Well, are you still friends with any 
               of your ex-girlfriends?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you know... I, uh... have many 
               relationships.
 
               
                             
               the door outside Nina's studio)

               
                             GEORGE
               You know, I'm a little nervous.

               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, you know... the friend meeting 
               the new woman. I feel like I'm
 
               
               getting fixed up for a friendship.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know how long this is gonna 
               last.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Really? I thought you liked her.

               
                             JERRY
               I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. 
               She doesn't like me having
 
               
               fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)

               
                             GEORGE
               You know, it's a miracle you're not 
               married. (beat) Hey, I'm not
 
               
               obligated to buy anything, am I?

               
               (Nina opens the door)

               
                             JERRY
               Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend 
               George.
 
               
                             NINA
               How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot 
               about you. (George nods)
 
               
                             JERRY
               (walking over to where Kramer is posing) 
               Hey, look at this guy!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah!

               
                             JERRY
               (to Nina) I brought George up to see 
               some of your paintings.
 
               
                             NINA
               Oh, are you interested?

               
                             GEORGE
               (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! 
               Sure, sure I'm interested.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               George, you gonna buy a painting?

               
                             GEORGE
               (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.

               
                             NINA
               Are you an art-lover?

               
                             GEORGE
               I am an art-adorer! I adore art.

               
                             NINA
               Great! Well, take a look around. Pick 
               out something you like.
 
               
               (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls 
               over to
 
               
               the painting-in-progress (Kramer) and picks up a brush.)

               
                             JERRY
               May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" 
               across the painting)
 
               
                             NINA
               (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, 
               play with this. (hands
 
               
               Jerry a small white envelope)

               
                             JERRY
               What's this?

               
                             NINA
               My father gave me four tickets to the 
               Yankee game for Saturday
 
               
               afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.

               
                             JERRY
               (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... 
               I'm working, I'm going
 
               
               out of town.

               
                             NINA
               Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. 
               Do you guys want 'em?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               (immediately) Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               They're right behind the dugout, George, 
               first row!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Behind the dugout, are you kidding? 
               How did you get them?
 
               
                             NINA
               Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... 
               it's the owner's box.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               All my life I've dreamed of sitting 
               front row, behind the dugout!
 
               
                             NINA
               (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting 
               George was apparently look-
 
               
               ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?

               
                             
               Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, 
               and Elaine are being lead
 
               
               to their seats)

               
                             GEORGE
               Look at where we are! (referring to 
               the seat usher) He's not
 
               
               stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher
 
               
               
               abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
 
               
               
                             USHER
               No, no, these are your seats.

               
                             GEORGE
               She said first row! Right behind the 
               dugout!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, it's the second row. It's just 
               as good.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I was all primed for the first row; 
               I was gonna put my feet up
 
               
               on the dugout!

               
                             ELAINE
               Would you shut up? These are great! 
               You can't get any better than
 
               
               this.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, there's better, (pointing at the 
               row in front of them) right
 
               
               there, that's better.

               
                             KRAMER
               Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, 
               who wants a dog? (Kramer
 
               
               hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!

               
                             ELAINE
               I could've been at my boss' son's bris 
               right now.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (amused) You're supposed to do that?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you 
               think anyone would want to
 
               
               go to a circumcision?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'd rather go to a hanging.

               
                             ELAINE
               Anyway, I called him back... I told 
               him I had to go visit my father
 
               
               in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)

                             MAN
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah?

               
                             MAN
               Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Hi!

               
                             KRAMER
               (screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA 
               CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               --and this is Kramer.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, hey.

               
               (the Yankees make a good play, the crowd applauds)

               
                             WEST
               So how are the seats?

               
                             GEORGE
               Okay.

               
                             ELAINE
               Great, great.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah.

               
                             WEST
               George, I heard you bought one of Nina's 
               paintings.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, it's being framed right now. I 
               don't even know what it costs.
 
               
               (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?

               
                             WEST
               Well, if you have a lot of money.

               
               (Yankees make a horrible play, the crowd responds)

               
                             WEST
               (leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat 
               -- to Elaine) I think you
 
               
               better take off that Orioles cap.

               
                             ELAINE
               (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
 
               
               
                             WEST
               No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the 
               owner's box, and I don't
 
               
               think it's a good idea.

               
                             ELAINE
               You're not serious.

               
                             WEST
               Yes, yes, yes, I am!

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, did he say that?

               
                             WEST
               No, no, but he gave me the seats. I 
               don't think he'd like it if
 
               
               you wore an Orioles cap.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well maybe you should ask him!

               
                             WEST
               I don't have to ask him! Now are you 
               gonna take the hat off or
 
               
               not?

               
                             ELAINE
               No! I don't have to take it off, why 
               should I take it off? This
 
               
               is ridiculous!!

               
                             GEORGE
               Just take the cap off.

               
                             ELAINE
               George, we are at a baseball game! This 
               is America!
 
               
                             WEST
               Look. Either you take the cap off, or 
               you'll have to leave.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it 
               off.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Just take the cap off!

               
                             ELAINE
               No!

               
               (a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking 
               off
 
               
               GEORGE'S hat, and throwing it onto the field... West calls security
 
               
               
               over, they proceed to remove Elaine)

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got 
               here!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with 
               you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               (getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               (sarcastically, to George) Stay!

               
                             GEORGE
               Okay, we'll go!

               
               (meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's 
               cap... the
 
               
               camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where 
               Kramer
 
               
                             IS

               head, he falls off the dugout onto

               ...and then the ball hits him in the 
               head and he falls right over

                             JERRY
               Is he okay?

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to 
               the emergency room, and you
 
               
               know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               This is the most amazing story I've 
               ever heard--why did he want you
 
               
               to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!

               
                             ELAINE
               I know! Can you imagine that?

               
               (Kramer enters with a bandage wrapper around his forehead)

               
                             JERRY
               How you feeling?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
               (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey,
 
               
               we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... 
               we're
 
               
               all in the picture.

               Wha- a picture?

               
                             KRAMER
               A picture.

               
                             ELAINE
               OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??

               
                             KRAMER
               Uh-huh.

                             ELAINE
               Hi, Mr. Lippman.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               How's your father?

               
                             ELAINE
               My, my father?

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Uh-huh.

               
                             ELAINE
               I went to visit him.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, 
               neuralgia...
 
               
                             LIPPMAN
               But--but he's feeling better now?

               
                             ELAINE
               Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a 
               miracle, um. My visit must have
 
               
               buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               (correcting her) Boo-eed.

               
                             ELAINE
               What--what did I say?

               
                             LIPPMAN
               You said "boyed."

               
                             ELAINE
               I did?

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Yeah.

               
               (Elaine starts to laugh hysterically, and at the same time discreetly 
               removes
 
               
               Lippman's sports section from his desk. She manages to maneuver 
               it into her
 
               
               lap, out of sight.)

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Well, I got a plane to catch.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh! Where are you going?

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Going to Houston. It's a publisher's 
               convention. (beat) Can I have
 
               
               my sports section?

               
                             ELAINE
               Ah. ...Yeah.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               I've been saving it for the plane. I 
               never miss the Sunday sports

               There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's 
               news. You know, the
 
               
               Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Right, right. (starts to take the paper 
               from Elaine's hand; Elaine
 
               
               holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?

               
                             ELAINE
               Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! 
               (laughs) That is the THIRD
 
               
               time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing 
               news-
 
               
               papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Gotta go.

               
                             ELAINE
               Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, 
               and uh... alrighty! (beat)
 
               
               I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!

               
                             
               Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong 
               are admiring Nina's "Kramer.")
 
               
                             MRS.ARM
               I sense great vulcrability. A land child 
               crying out for love, an
 
               
               innocent orphan in the post-modern world.

               
                             MR. ARM
               I see a parasite.

               
                             MRS.ARM
               A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is 
               seeking to gratify only his
 
               
               most basic and immediate urges.

               
                             
               Another part of the studio where Jerry 
               and Nina are arguing.)
 
               
                             NINA
               She was a guest of my father's. She 
               should've taken the cap off.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's preposterous! They ask someone 
               to take off a baseball cap
 
               
               at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?

                             MRS.ARM
               He is struggled, he is man-struggled. 
               He lifts my spirit!
 
               
                             MR. ARM
               He is a loathsome, offensive brute, 
               yet I can't look away.
 
               
                             
               Jerry and Nina again.)

               
                             JERRY
               Look, I'm really getting tired off all 
               the fighting. Maybe we
 
               
               should just end this before we really start hating each other.
 
               
               
                             NINA
               Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because 
               you always have to
 
               
               remain friends!

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I like to remain friends with 
               people I was friends with!
 
               
                             NINA
               Hey -- why don't you just go then! And 
               -- oh, give this to George.
 
               
               Tell him he owes me $500!

               He transcends time and space.

               
                             MR. ARM
               He sickens me.

               
                             MRS.ARM
               I love it.

               
                             MR. ARM
               Me too.

                             GEORGE
               Five-hundred dollars?! What?

               
                             JERRY
               That's what she told me!

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a 
               piece of junk!
 
               
                             JERRY
               That's what it costs!

               
                             GEORGE
               Why did you even take it? You broke 
               up with her!
 
               
                             JERRY
               I wasn't thinking! I don't know.

               
                             GEORGE
               You weren't thinking.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, she framed it and everything.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget 
               it. No way I'm buying this!
 
               
               (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly
 
               
               
               lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?

               
                             JERRY
               Do you want me to paint you something? 
               I'd love to paint you some-
 
               
               thing!

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not paying for this. If you were 
               going out with her, it'd be a
 
               
               different story.

               
                             KRAMER
               (entering, handing Jerry a piece of 
               paper) This was in front of your
 
               
               door.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, Kramer.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hi, Mike.

               
                             JERRY
               (looking at the paper) Wow, a letter 
               from Nina!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               (notices the painting) Whoa, man! That 
               is the ugliest thing I've ever
 
               
               seen!

               
                             JERRY
               (reading note) Oh my god!

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               This is amazing, you can't believe this!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What's it say?

               
                             JERRY
               Listen to this: "I don't know what you 
               expect to find out there,
 
               
               Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one 
               thing
 
               
               I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything
 
               
               
               I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with 
               my fists,
 
               
               because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness
 
               
               
               and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm 
               will-
 
               
               ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."

               
                             GEORGE
               WOW!

               (emotionally) She's deep.

               (reading on) "...'cause that's what 
               you need to do to prove I'm not
 
               
               going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places 
               and
 
               
               people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"

                             JERRY
               No one's ever written me a letter like 
               this. Maybe I was wrong about
 
               
               her!

               Get in there and give her a
 
               
               call. Pick up the phone and call her!

               
                             JERRY

               ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.

               SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV 
               is heard) I told ya! (the inter-

                             JERRY
               Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta 
               get a posse together. I love
 
               
               a good posse.

               
                             NINA
               What's the appeal of the posse?

               
                             JERRY
               The appeal of the posse? The posse has 
               tremendous appeal. Get away
 
               
               from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, 
               it's a
 
               
               week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.

               
               (George enters)

               
                             NINA
               Hello, George.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, 
               don't I?
 
               
                             NINA
               Well, I really love that piece.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy 
               oh boy...! You know, in fact,
 
               
               I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from 
               you!
 
               
               Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You 
               know
 
               
               what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.

               
                             NINA
               No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. 
               I want you to have it!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               This could be in a museum some day! 
               It's not safe with me! It should
 
               
               really be in a doormanned building.

               
                             NINA
               Honestly, George, the money's not important.

               buzzes)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah?

               
                             ELAINE
               (on intercom) It's Elaine.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             NINA
               Elaine?

               
                             JERRY
               ...Yeah.

               
                             NINA
               (rolling eyes) This person does not 
               believe in telephones, does she?
 
               
                             JERRY
               She likes the pop-in. I've told her 
               how I hate the pop-in. (pointing
 
               
               to George) He likes the pop-in, too.

               
                             GEORGE
               I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in 
               guy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               How 'bout Kramer.

               
                             JERRY
               HUGE pop-in guy!

               
                             NINA
               Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, 
               we're on for tomorrow?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             NINA
               Okay.

               
                             JERRY
               Okay!

               
                             NINA
               Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, 
               Elaine walks in.)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (to Nina) Hello!

               
               (Nina doesn't respond, just walks past Elaine)

               
                             ELAINE
               (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's 
               coming back tomorrow, I'll
 
               
               be fired!

               
                             JERRY
               If he noticed, he would have called 
               you from Houston!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, he wants to torture me.

               
                             
               later on that night. George, Elaine, 
               and Jerry are watching TV.
 
               
               Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? 
               I hate it when you're the
 
               
               clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, 
               insti-
 
               
               gating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great 
               clicker! (gets the clicker back)
 
               
               Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.

               
                             ELAINE
               You're all over the dial! You don't 
               know what you want! I've never
 
               
               seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
 
               
               
               (another tug-o-war starts)

               
                             JERRY
               Let go!

               
                             ELAINE
               No, come on! I want it, Jerry!

               
                             JERRY
               Let go, Elaine!

               
                             ELAINE
               Well at least let George do it!

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, George can't click! (George joins 
               in the fight)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) 
               Give it! Give it! (he finally
 
               
               gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.

               
               (George starts clicking, the first station he lands on is playing 
               Neil Simon's
 
               
               Chapter 2. After a few seconds, George gets bored, and changes 
               the station)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back 
               to that. (they watch it a little
 
               
               longer)

               
                             ELAINE
               It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.

               
                             JERRY
               (on to something) Wait a second... wait 
               a second!! (he watches the TV
 
               
               for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!

               
                             ELAINE
               What letter?

               
                             JERRY
               This is the letter she wrote to me, 
               she stole it right from the movie!
 
               
               
               (Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, 
               and starts
 
               
               reading in unison with movie on TV.)

               
                             JERRY
               "...'cause you don't even make the slightest 
               effort to offer happiness
 
               
               still know that I love you!!"

               
                             GEORGE
               This is incredible!

               
                             JERRY
               I always thought there was something 
               funny about this letter! She cop-
 
               
               
               ied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe I won't send her that check.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               You know, it's not really that terrible.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What are you talking about? She completely 
               misrepresented herself!
 
               
               (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness!
 
               
               
               James Caan doesn't offer happiness!

               
                             
               Lippman's office. Lippman is on the 
               phone when Elaine walks in and
 
               
               places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave
 
               
               
               but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the 
               room)
 
               
                             LIPPMAN
               (into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't 
               take the cap off? (beat)
 
               
               But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's
 
               
               
               unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. 
               Take
 
               
               care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny 
               West,
 
               
               my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees
 
               
               
               too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they 
               throw
 
               
               him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter.
 
               
               
               She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to 
               some
 
               
               friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore
 
               
               
               cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?

               
                             ELAINE
               Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR 
               Baltimore.
 
               
                             LIPPMAN
               Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, uh, fan. My father--

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Anyway, she refused to take the cap 
               off; caused a whole big scene!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Really?

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Yeah.

               
                             ELAINE
               So... impudent.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for 
               tomorrow night. I'm inviting
 
               
               Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.

               
                             ELAINE
               (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, 
               Mr. Li--
 
               
                             LIPPMAN
               Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, 
               I want you at the game.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (very reluctant) Okay.

               
                             LIPPMAN
               Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and 
               Elaine. You know the Baltimore
 
               
               cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little 
               fun with
 
               
               him.

               
                             ELAINE
               That will be fun.

               
               
               
                             
               Nina's studio. Nina is working on a 
               painting. Jerry is watching her,
 
               
               sitting on the sofa.)

               
                             JERRY
               How's it coming?

               
                             NINA
               Good, good.

               
                             JERRY
               Seen any good movies lately?

               
                             NINA
               No... not really. You?

               
                             JERRY
               No. I like a good comedy. You know, 
               like a Neil Simon? You like Neil
 
               
               Simon?

               
                             NINA
               Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite 
               would have to be, uh...
 
               
               Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?

               
                             NINA
               I don't know... maybe.

               
                             JERRY
               I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was 
               on TV just the other night.
 
               
               Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't 
               help
 
               
               notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina 
               opens
 
               
               answer the door...)

               
                             MR. ARM
               Well, we've made our decision. We want

               Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and 
               George are watching a baseball
 
               
               game and talking.)

               
                             GEORGE
               Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy 
               Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               So is it all over between you and... 
               Marsha Mason?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George 
               bought) And by the way, can
 
               
               you get this thing outta my house?

               
                             GEORGE
               Tell you what, I'll make a deal with 
               you. I'll sell it to you right
 
               
               now for ten bucks.

               
               (the Yankees announcer is heard on TV)

               
                             TVVOICE
               Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble 
               in the area just behind the
 
               
               Yankee dugout.

               
                             GEORGE
               Behind the dugout, that's where we were 
               sitting the other day.
 
               
                             TVVOICE
               Well, we're not going to show it, we 
               don't want to encourage that kind
 
               
               
               of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going 
               at it
 
               
               with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're 
               getting
 
               
               the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers?
 
               
               
               Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."

               
               (Jerry and George look at each other, wondering.)

               
                             
               the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and 
               Mrs. Armstrong are having
 
               
               Kramer over for dinner.)

               
                             KRAMER
               ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran 
               away from home and hopped a
 
               
               steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
 
               
               
                             MRS.ARM
               More potatoes?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, sure. Please.

               
                             MR. ARM
               Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship 
               to Sweden?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.

               Let me speak with the head librarian. 
               ... Because it's absurd. An overdue 
               book
 
               
               from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio 
               station?

               Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK 
               I can be down there in like a half hour.
 
               
               
               Bye.

               
                             KRAMER
               What's the problem?

               
                             JERRY
               This you're not goin' to believe. The 
               NYPL says that I took out Tropic of 
               Cancer
 
               
               in 1971 and never returned it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Do you know how much that comes to? 
               That's a nickel a day for 20 years. 
               It's
 
               
               going to be $50,000

               
                             JERRY
               It doesn't work like that.

               
                             KRAMER
               If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's not going to be anything. I returned 
               the book. I remember it very vividly
 
               
               
               because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. 
               It was the first time I
 
               
               ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade 
               she was developing this
 
               
               body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. 
               And then one day ...
 
               
               FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               That orange dress is burned in my memory
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, memory burn.

               
                             JERRY
               I wonder what ever happened to her.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               How did they ever find you?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, computers, they're cracking down 
               now on overdue books. The whole thing 
               is
 
               
               completely ridiculous.

                             JERRY
               It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're 
               going to the library
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You know I never got a library card.

                             KRAMER
               It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there 
               anyway. People sitting around reading
 
               
               
               the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a 
               quarter, ooh,
 
               
                             JERRY
               I gotta go to the library. You want 
               to go?
 
               
                             KRAMER

               The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam 
               that was. Boy that Dewey guy really 
               cleaned
 
               
               up on that deal.

               Tryin' to save a quarter.

               
                             JERRY
               I kinda like those sticks. I'd like 
               to get them for my house.

               ...
 
               
               Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was 
               a schoolgirl. There was
 
               
               a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. 
               She needs a little understanding.
 
               
               She needs a little Kramer.

               library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.

               Lt. Bookman has been working here for

               Where's Karen?

               
                             SECRETARY
               She went to pick up lunch.

               
                             ELAINE
               She didn't ask me what I wanted.

               
                             SECRETARY
               She must have forgot.

               
                             ELAINE
               How could she forget I've been ordering 
               lunch every day here for 3 and a half 
               years?
 
               
               Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting 
               a really weird vibe.
 
               
               Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.
 
               
               
                             SECRETARY
               I don't know anything.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ah, you don't know anything. You see, 
               "I don't know anything", means there's
 
               
               
               something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would 
               have said "You're crazy."

               And then that lunch thing.

               
                             JERRY
               So they forgot to get your lunch. Big 
               deal!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What do you know. You've never worked 
               in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See,
 
               
               
               you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but 
               you understand, ... LUNCH!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't understand lunch, I don't know 
               anything about lunch. Listen. Just because
 
               
               
               I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does 
               it?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What did he do?

               
                             GEORGE
               He purposely mispronounced my name. 
               Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say,
 
               
               
               "Can't stand ja".

               
               "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I remember he made you wear a jock on 
               your head for a whole class. And the 
               straps
 
               
               were hangin' down by his ,...

               
                             GEORGE
               OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. 
               It was like from an exhumed corpse.

                             GEORGE
               Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in 
               for me. He actually failed me in gym.
 
               
               
               ... ME!

                             HEYMAN
               Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes, Mr. Hayman

               
                             HEYMAN
               Your underwear was stick'n out of your 
               shorts during gym class.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well I guess that's because I wear boxer 
               shorts.
 
               
                             HEYMAN
               Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not really sure, I...

               
                             HEYMAN
               Well let's take a look.

               
                             
               gets a wedgie)

               
               
               
               BACK TO MONK'S

               
                             GEORGE
               He gave me a wedgie.

               
                             JERRY
               He got fired the next day.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why do they call it a wedgie?

               
                             GEORGE
               Because the underwear is pulled up from 
               the back and ... it wedges in..
 
               
                             JERRY
               They also have an atomic wedgie. Now 
               the goal there is to actually get the
 
               
               
               waistband on top of the head. Very rare.

                             JERRY
               Well what do girls do ?

               
                             ELAINE
               We just tease some one 'til they develop 
               an eating disorder.
 
               
               guy who ruined his life.

                             KRAMER
               Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You 
               know this guy Bookman from the library
 
               
               
               he's waiting for ya.

               
               
               
               STANDUP ROUTINE

               
               What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where 
               you go in you can take
 
               
               out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring 
               it back when you're done.
 
               
               It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had 
               when they were a little
 
               
               kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just 
               be his friend. That's
 
               
               what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And 
               that's why everybody
 
               
               kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... 
               I'll bring it back late.
 
               
               ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?

               Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can 
               get this all straightened out. Would
 
               
               
               you like a cup of tea?

               
                             BOOKMAN
               You got any coffee?

               
                             JERRY
               Coffee?

               
                             BOOKMAN
               Yeah. Coffee.

               
                             JERRY
               No, I don't drink coffee.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about 
               instant coffee?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I don't have--

               
                             BOOKMAN
               You don't have any instant coffee?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I don't normally--

               
                             BOOKMAN
               Who doesn't have instant coffee?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, 
               you put it in the cupboard, you
 
               
               forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. 
               It lasts
 
               
               forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.

               
                             JERRY
               Really? I'll have to remember that.
 
               
               
                             BOOKMAN
               You took this book out in 1971.

               Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               Yeah, '71. That was my first year on 
               the job. Bad year for libraries.
 
               
               Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman
 
               
               
               telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the 
               length of
 
               
               his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my 
               bag. But
 
               
               you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public
 
               
               
               Library, fella.

               
                             JERRY
               Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that 
               book. I remember it very
 
               
               specifically.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               You're a comedian, you make people laugh.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I try.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               You think this is all a big joke, don't 
               you?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I don't.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered 
               your name--from my list. I looked
 
               
               
               it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're 
               a celebrity
 
               
               that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above 
               the law?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Certainly not.

               
                             BOOKMAN
               Well, let me tell you something, funny 
               boy. Y'know that little stamp,
 
               
               the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not 
               mean
 
               
               anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of 
               a lot.
 
               
               
               Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know 
               what you're
 
               
               thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library
 
               
               
               books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live 
               without
 
               
               libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old 
               to change
 
               
               the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, 
               right
 
               
               now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of 
               pee-pees
 
               
               and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?
 
               
               
               Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue
 
               
               
               fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about 
               that
 
               
               
               that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. 
               You and
 
               
               
               is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!

                             MARION
               It's Bookman the library cop.

               
                             KRAMER
               So I didn't do anything wrong.

               
                             MARION
               I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get 
               fired. I shouldn't have come here.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Why don't ya' leave?

               
                             MARION
               I can't.

               No way I'm payin' that! I returned that 
               book I n 1971. I have a witness
 
               
               Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece 
               of black jack gum.
 
               
               It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it.

               Marsha
 
               
               to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough 
               ... I think.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So Sherry, what do you remember about 
               that day at the library?
 
               
                             SH
               I remember it like it was yesterday. 
               It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a 
               purple dress.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
 
               
               
                             SH
               Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. 
               I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? 
               Dentyne?

               Licorice gum? Never! We were reading

               discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private 
               life.
 
               
               We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't 
               have
 
               
               
               library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final

               Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the 
               steps of the library. I sat down
 
               
               next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game 
               against Erasmus
 
               
                             JERRY
               That was double overtime.

               
                             GEORGE
               So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george 
               Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move.
 
               
               
               So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and 
               smiles, the little
 
               
               baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding 
               me back. It was
 
               
               Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 
               42nd St. library ,
 
               
               a grown man, getting a wedgie.

               
                             ELAINE
               At least it wasn't atomic.

               
                             GEORGE
               It was.

               
                             JERRY
               So Georgie Boy, guess what happened 
               to TROPIC OF CANCER
 
               
                             GEORGE
               How should I know?

               
                             JERRY
               Because I gave it to you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me?

               
                             JERRY
               Yesah, think. Don't you remember you 
               kept begging me to see it then finally
 
               
               
               I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym 
               locker room.
 
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               The locker room!

               
               THE LOCKER ROOM

               
                             JERRY
               Here's the book. Don't let anybody see 
               it. Don't let anything happen to it.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, 
               I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               All right, I'll see you after school. 
               I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
 
               
                             HEYMAN
               Can't Stand Ya'.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes Mr. Hayman.

               
                             HEYMAN
               Your underwear was stick'n out of your 
               shorts during gym class.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well I guess that's because I wear boxer 
               shorts.
 
               
                             HEYMAN
               Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not really sure, I...

               
                             HEYMAN
               Well let's take a look.

               
               (George gets a wedgie and TROPIC OF CANCER falls on floor)

               ( Jerry writes out a check for the never-returned TROPIC OF CANCER 
               and hands it to Bookman)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
 
               
               
                             BOOKMAN
               Hard feelings? What do you know about 
               hard feelings? Y'ever have a man
 
               
               die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?

               
                             JERRY
               What is your problem?

               
                             BOOKMAN
               What's my problem? Punks like you, that's 
               my problem. And you better not
 
               
               screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over 
               you like a
 
               
               pitbull on a poodle.

               
                             JERRY
               (after Bookman exits): That is one tough 
               monkey! (turns to Elaine)
 
               
               So you were saying?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I 
               gave my boss Marion's poems.
 
               
               The ones that affected Kramer so much.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, beautiful did he like them?

               
                             ELAINE
               No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               (to George) Was he out there?

               
                             GEORGE
               Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened 
               to him.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I guess we'll never know.

                             HEYMAN

               ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground)
 
               
               
               
               
               STAND UP

               
               It was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind 
               of like started of kind
 
               
               of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and 
               then suddenly you're like
 
               
               in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from 
               a rope. You have hardly
 
               
               any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock 
               strap?" Ya' know and kids
 
               
               are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... 
               Then its History,
 
               
               Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of

               Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores 
               have any idea
 
               what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you 
               think they just
 
               feel they have their own little country out there and they can 
               charge anything
 
               they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You 
               don't like it;
 
               go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline 
               complex is a
 
               huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit 
               is what's
 
               supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about 
               it; the terminals,
 
               the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't 
               notice the beating
 
               that you're taking on the tuna.

               
               
               George is at the airport.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's all departures. I see nothing but 
               departures. (to the woman
 
               beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?

               
               The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the 
               other side.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
 
               
               
                             MAN
               There's a clock over there.

               
                             GEORGE
               Where?

               
                             MAN
               There.

               
                             GEORGE
               But you have a watch on.

               
                             MAN
               It's right by the escalator.

               
                             GEORGE
               Why don't you just look at your watch?
 
               
               
                             MAN
               I told you, it's right over there.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Let me see the watch.

               
               George grabs the man's wrist.

               
                             MAN
               Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You know we're living in a society!
 
               
               
               Jerry walks up from the ramp.

               
                             JERRY
               George.

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry. Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've 
               you been waiting?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I just got here. My car broke down on 
               the Belt Parkway.
 
               
               Jerry, Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece 
               of junk.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               One mile from the exit it starts shaking, 
               really violently shaking,
 
               like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So you have no car?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               So what good are you?

               
               Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says 
               O'BRIEN
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's 
               gonna be waiting a while,
 
               O'Brien's not showing up.

               
                             GEORGE
               How do you know?

               
                             JERRY
               He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, 
               wouldn't let him on the
 
               plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square 
               Garden.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               We should take his limo.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, right.

               
                             GEORGE
               Wait a second. Think about it. He's 
               not showing up. Wait till you
 
               see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said 
               he's in
 
               Chicago.

               
                             JERRY
               He's definitely in Chicago.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well the guy's just standing there.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How would we do it?

               
                             GEORGE
               We just go up to him, we say, "We're

                             JERRY
               Maybe he knows O'Brien?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew 
               O'Brien he wouldn't have a
 
               sign. Let's just do it.

               
                             JERRY
               What if we get caught?

               
                             GEORGE
               What's gonna happen? They can't kill 
               us.

               Who's gonna be O'Brien?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'll be O'Brien.

               
                             JERRY
               Who am I?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're you.

               
                             JERRY

                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Okay.

               
                             GEORGE
               What, you don't want to be you?

               
                             JERRY
               Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why 
               can't I be somebody?
 
               
                             GEORGE

               This is incredible! This is one of the 
               greatest things I've ever done
 
               in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.

               What for?

               ma? It's me. Guess where I am.
 
               In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I 
               can't tell you
 
               now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would 
               you stop

               How's this? I'm

               I thought I saw him look in the mirror 
               suspiciously.
 
               
                             JERRY
               He can't hear us.

               Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do 
               you say we stop off, pick up
 
               your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.

               And of course, his great book, "The 
               Game".
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work 
               in the big game. So you've never
 
               uh, met him before?

               
                             EVA
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               Never seen a picture of him?

               
                             EVA
               Never.

               
                             JERRY
               Not even on the book jacket?

               
                             EVA
               There was no picture on the book jacket.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got 
               company. Wake up.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hello. I'm O'Brien.

               
               
               
               Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey!

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey!

               
                             KRAMER
               What, you took a cab?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah? So?

               
                             KRAMER
               How much do you make?

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm not telling you.

               
                             KRAMER
               C'mon.

               
                             ELAINE
               No!

               
                             KRAMER
               I'll tell you how much I make.

               
                             ELAINE
               I know how much you make. I don't even 
               know why I'm doing this, I
 
               don't even like basketball.

               
                             KRAMER
               You ever seen Michael Jordan?

               
                             ELAINE
               Just in those commercials.

               
                             KRAMER
               Maybe you'll see him do one of those 
               three-sixty dunks.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What's that?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, it's like this, here, you guard 
               me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Huh?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah.

               
               Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a 
               bunch of garbage
 
               cans.

               
               
               Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't think we're gonna make the tip 
               off.
 
               
                             TIM
               You think someone's been tipped off?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               So, um, you've read "The Big Game", 
               have you?
 
               
                             EVA
               Yes I've read it and I've memorized 
               it.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Tell me your impressions, I would love 
               to hear what a young woman
 
               thinks of "The Big Game".

               
                             EVA
               Well, this is sort of embarrassing, 
               but it's changed my life. The way you
 
               
               analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well 
               it left me
 
               breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, it's just a game. Remember that, 
               kids.
 
               
                             TIM
               Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget 
               what you wrote in the
 
               epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this 
               game.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just 
               for effect.
 
               
                             JERRY
               He tends to exaggerate.

               
                             GEORGE
               Okay, I mean it's serious but--

               
                             EVA
               We are really looking forward to your 
               speech tonight.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, my speech?

               
                             EVA
               Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. 
               Would you like to look it over?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well you might as well look it over.
 
               
               
               
               Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.

               
                             KRAMER
               So what's going on, how did all this 
               happen?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry and George called me from this 
               limo and they said we're all going
 
               
               to the Knicks-Bulls game.

               
                             KRAMER
               Limo? I thought that George went to 
               pick him up.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               He did.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well then why would they take a limo 
               from the airport?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know.

               
                             KRAMER
               That's pretty strange. Did he say anything 
               else?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really 
               important that we call them
 
               O'Brien and Murphy.

               
                             KRAMER
               O'Brien. Why would he want to be called 
               O'Brien?
 
               
               
               Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               ...and the Jews steal our money through 
               their Zionist occupied
 
               government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed 
               white
 
               minority communities.

               
                             JERRY
               You're not going to open with that, 
               are you?
 
               
                             EVA
               What was that you said about the myth 
               of the Holocaust?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I said so many things.

               
               Suddenly they hear a loud bang.

               
                             GEORGE
               They're shooting! They're shooting!
 
               
               
                             TIM
               Alright, get down!

               
               The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look 
               around, Eva has
 
               fallen on top of George.

               
               Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.

               
                             GEORGE
               That's really very nice of you, Eva. 
               Thank you.
 
               
                             EVA
               But of course you know I would. I would 
               do anything for you. Anything.
 
               
               Tim returns.

               
                             TIM
               Nothing to worry about, it was just 
               a flat tire. But rest assured, we're
 
               
               prepared to handle anything that might come up.

               
               Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and 
               starts handling
 
               it sensually.

               
                             JERRY
               Nice looking Lugar.

               
               
               
               Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.

               
                             JODI
               I'm standing in front of the Paramount 
               adjacent to Madison Square Garden
 
               
               where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators 
               are gathering to
 
               protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the 
               leader of the
 
               midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to 
               be their most
 
               charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate 
               of the violent
 
               overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration 
               of Adolf
 
               Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. 
               There is a
 
               full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources 
               tell me he is
 
               in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set 
               up barricades, but
 
               quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match 
               for the emotional
 
               fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, 
               I'm Jodi
 
               Baskerville, back to you in the studio.

               
               
               Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.

               
                             KRAMER
               Something's very strange. George goes 
               to the airport to pick up Jerry.
 
               They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball 
               game and wanna be
 
               called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?

               
               A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of 
               them recognized
 
               Elaine.

               
                             DAN
               Elaine?

               
                             ELAINE
               Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?

               
                             DAN
               Good.

               
                             ELAINE
               Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.

               
                             DAN
               Oh, Kramer?

               
               They shake hands.

               
                             ELAINE
               What's going on?

               
                             DAN
               Oh, we're heading down to protest this 
               big neo-nazi rally. The head of
 
               the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should 
               come.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls 
               game.
 
               
                             DAN
               Oh, well that's where the rally is. 
               The Paramount, right next door.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
 
               
               
                             DAN
               Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be 
               something, this is the first time
 
               
               he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks 
               like.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Who?

               
                             DAN
               The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.
 
               
               
               
               Cut back to the limo.

               Jerry and George are alone inside.

               
                             JERRY
               What's taking him so long out there?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Didja see the way she was looking at 
               me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!

               
                             GEORGE
               I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi 
               though.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well we gotta make a plan before they 
               come back, what are we gonna do?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               Let's just make a run for it.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How'd that happen?

               
                             GEORGE
               I hurt it in a hotel room. You know 
               where they tuck the covers in real
 
               
               tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried 
               to kick it out
 
               and I pulled it.

               
                             JERRY
               I know, why do they make that bed so 
               tight? You gotta sleep with your
 
               feet like that.

               
                             GEORGE
               For a mental patient. Wait a minute, 
               the phone, we'll call the police.
 
               
               
               George grabs the phone and dials.

               
                             GEORGE
               9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. 
               Hello, police? Uh, yeah
 
               listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--

               
               Tim re-enters the limo.

               
                             GEORGE
               --Astroturf? You know who's responsible 
               for that, don't you?! The
 
               Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always 
               will.
 
               
                             TIM
               We'll be ready in a minute.

               
                             GEORGE
               Would you excuse us for a minute Tim 
               boy, we're kind of in the middle
 
               of something.

               
                             TIM
               With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're 
               just about to leave.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, 
               you or me?
 
               
                             TIM
               You are.

               
                             GEORGE
               And who's responsible for making hate 
               mongering and fascism popular
 
               again?

               
                             TIM
               You are.

               
                             GEORGE
               Good. I think you forgot something.
 
               
               
                             TIM
               I'm sorry.

               
                             GEORGE
               Good. Now get out.

               
               Tim leaves.

               
                             GEORGE
               Okay, what are we gonna do?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know.

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, how's this? We wait till we 
               get to your street corner, we see
 
               
               Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the 
               city.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Nah. No one's ever been shot in the 
               city.
 
               
               
               Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm telling you, something's going on. 
               I can feel it, sense it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sure he was just joking around.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's 
               coming in from Chicago,
 
               Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my 
               god. Yes. Yes!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What is it?

               
                             KRAMER
               Don't you see? There's always been something 
               very strange about Jerry,
 
               always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for 
               you? The limo?
 
               The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien 
               are the same
 
               person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry's a nazi?!

               
                             KRAMER
               I can't believe I didn't see it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I 
               know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You don't think so.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, he's just neat.

               
               
               Cut back to the limo.

               
                             TIM
               You know it's funny. You don't look 
               like an O'Brien.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Me??

               
               George and Jerry laugh nervously.

               
                             TIM
               And you really don't look like a Murphy.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I may not look like a Murphy but I act 
               like a Murphy.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to 
               a fault.
 
               
                             TIM
               Where are you from?

               
                             JERRY
               Dublin. Originally. Parents came over 
               here when I was eighteen.
 
               Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful 
               country
 
               though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.

               
                             TIM
               Sounds more like Scottish.

               
                             JERRY
               We were right on the border.

               
               
               Cut back to the street corner.

               
                             KRAMER
               Maybe he's with the company.

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there 
               to infiltrate the organization
 
               from within.

               
                             ELAINE
               What about his comedy act?

               
                             KRAMER
               That's the perfect cover! All that time 
               on the road? Look Jerry, he's
 
               too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic 
               people.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What about George?

               
                             KRAMER
               What about him, he's part of it. His 
               whole personality is a disguise.
 
               No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you 
               they're with
 
               the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with 
               Helms and Hunt
 
               and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably 
               know who killed
 
               Kennedy!

               
                             ELAINE
               I'll bet they were even in on it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not 
               gonna let him hurt you. (grabs
 
               and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer, you're hurting me!

               
               
               Quick cut to the now approaching limo.

               
                             GEORGE
               Those are my friends I was telling you 
               about. We're gonna talk to
 
               them, pull over.

               
                             ELAINE
               Get off of me!!

               
               The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.

               
                             KRAMER
               O'Brien.

               
               This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at 
               a nearby bus
 
               stop.

               
                             MAN
               O'Brien? Is that him?

               
                             MAN #2
               Yeah, that's him.

               
                             MAN #3
               Look there's O'Brien!

               
                             MAN #4
               Filthy nazi bastard!

               
                             ALL FOUR
               Let's get him!!

               
               They begin running full speed towards the gang.

               
                             GEORGE
               What do I do?! What do I do?!

               
                             JERRY
               Get in the car! Get in the car!

               
               George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which 
               speeds off.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, 
               Murphy?
 
               
                             TIM
               Why did you call him O'Brien and him 
               Murphy?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               It could be very confusing.

               
               The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah? Eva?

               
                             EVA
               It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups 
               receiver) It's O'Brien.

               Who are you?

               
               George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's 
               car broke
 
               down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.

               
               
               Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.

               A limousine has just pulled up it's 
               being surrounded by a huge group of
 
               
               protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.

               
               Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, 
               none of the three
 
               are intelligible at this point.

               They are banging on the car, trying 
               to flip it over. The police seem
 
               unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. 
               O'Brien must be
 
               having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for 
               his first public
 
               appearance.

               
               Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated 
               and less
 
               understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva 
               are becoming
 
               unnerved.

               
                             EVA
               Get out!!

               
                             ELAINE
               Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!

               
                             DAN
               Elaine?

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey!

               
               
               Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic 
               says 'DONALD
 
               O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.

               
                             GEORGE
               I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! 
               I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone!
 
               Jerry?! Jerry?!!

               So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World 
               War Two movie and
 
               there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in 
               those movies always
 
               had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that 
               they would do
 
               and then when they were around the offices they had like this 
               casual heil,
 
               remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, 
               heil, how are ya,
 
               is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished 
               with the copier?
 
               Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, 
               heil, nice
 
               to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?

               
               
               
                                   THE END

               Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to 
               be two-and-a-half
 
               feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't 
               be down there
 
               on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, 
               nuclear
 
               physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be 
               two-and-a-half
 
               feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread 
               out, give me
 
               some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could 
               see is typing
 
               everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get 
               all the words on
 
               there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in 
               the roller of the
 
               typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, 
               I'd like to
 
               get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, 
               only I'm
 
               allowed up here."

               
               
               
               First scene.

               
               Jerry and George are at a newsstand.

               
                             GEORGE
               Where'd you meet her?

               
                             JERRY
               I met her on an elevator.

               
                             GEORGE
               On an elevator? You met a woman on an 
               elevator?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Impossible, right?

               
                             GEORGE
               You got less than sixty seconds. That's 
               like dismantling a time bomb.
 
               
               What got into you?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. She was so beautiful, 
               it was like a pure reflex. The
 
               
               words just came out of my mouth.

               
                             GEORGE
               Wow. What'd you say?

               
               (flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator)

               
                             JERRY
               You know, I'm the one responsible for 
               those crop circles in England.
 
               
               (end of flashback)

               
                             GEORGE
               Wow.

               
                             JERRY
               Can you believe I did that?

               
                             GEORGE
               What did she say?

               
               (another flashback)

               
                             ISABEL
               What crop circles?

               
               (end of flashback)

               
                             JERRY
               Not a good sign.

               
                             GEORGE
               Not everybody knows what the crop circles 
               are. (to the newsstand
 
               
               owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?

               
                             NEWSSTAND OWNER
               Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You got something in your teeth there.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               It's green.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking 
               around like this all
 
               
               afternoon.

               
                             JERRY
               Did you bump into anybody you knew?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I had a job interview.

               
                             JERRY
               How'd it go?

               
                             GEORGE
               Take a guess.

               
               (flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's 
               spinached
 
               
               teeth.)

               
                             INTERVIEWER
               Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing 
               available at the present time,
 
               
               but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.

               
                             GEORGE
               Ok, thanks.

               
               (end of flashback)

               
                             JERRY
               What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, right.

               
                             JERRY
               What's the matter?

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, nothing.

               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               You won't think I'm a bad person?

               
                             JERRY
               Too late for that.

               
                             GEORGE
               'Cause believe me, I would only say 
               this to you and maybe a
 
               
               psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, she's got a big nose.

               
                             GEORGE
               I mean, big would even be ok, a little 
               beyond big.
 
               
               (momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose)

               
                             JERRY
               It's a schnoz.

               
                             GEORGE
               Now, I'm aware that my own physical 
               dimensions are perhaps a little
 
               
               short of perfection.

               
                             JERRY
               A little.

               
                             GEORGE
               So who am I to be thinking about someone's 
               nose? I mean, I should be
 
               
               grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. 
               But I have
 
               
               to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the 
               nose. I don't
 
               
               ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed 
               at night, I tell
 
               
               myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I 
               think about it. I
 
               
               look at her, I see nose.

               
                             JERRY
               Stop being so concerned with looks.
 
               
               
               (momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number)

               
                             JERRY
               Have you said anything to her about 
               it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I could never do that. You know the 
               ironic thing is if she had a
 
               
               smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first 
               place. She'd be
 
               
               out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, 
               I know that. And
 
               
               I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, shut up, here they come.

               
                             GEORGE
               How can I not think about it? Look at 
               the size of this thing.
 
               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza 
               at Jerry's
 
               
               apartment.

               
                             KRAMER
               So my mother's going out with this guy 
               who leaves a jacket in her house
 
               
               so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows 
               up and he
 
               
               takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail 
               fraud. So
 
               
               Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell 
               the landlord that
 
               
               you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Won't the landlord know I'm not the 
               daughter?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               No no, he's never met her. She's in 
               California.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Are you coming with me?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, 
               Peter Von Nostrand.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why don't you just commit yourself already?
 
               
               
                             AUDREY
               What is so special about this jacket?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               He believes it possesses some extraordinary 
               power over women.
 
               
                             AUDREY
               What's the smudge on your hand?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge 
               last night. Yeah, I'm going
 
               
               back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover 
               charge.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What, you didn't wash all day?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You 
               wouldn't believe the women at
 
               
               this club. Ohh, man.

               
                             AUDREY
               It's amazing how many beautiful women 
               live in New York. I actually
 
               
               find it kind of intimidating.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you're as pretty as any of them, 
               you just need a nose job.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer!

               
                             KRAMER
               What? What?

               
                             ELAINE
               How could you say something like that?!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What? What do you mean? I just said 
               she needs a nose job.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No no, there's nothing wrong with her 
               nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
 
               
                             AUDREY
               No, it's ok.

               
                             ELAINE
               What did you have to say that for?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Well, I was just trying to help out.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket 
               goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You see what happens when you try to 
               be nice?
 
               
               
               
               
               
               Mid-episode monologue.

               
               But what would the world be like if people said whatever they 
               were thinking, all
 
               
               the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date 
               last? About
 
               
               thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." 
               "That's ok,
 
               
               your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, 
               ok, thank you
 
               
               very much."

               
               
               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment.

               
                             AUDREY
               Elaine said I could stay with her another 
               month until Tina gets back.
 
               
               What are you thinking about?

               
                             GEORGE
               Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly 
               be thinking?
 
               
                             AUDREY
               You look like you've got something on 
               your mind.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something 
               on my mind. (pregnant pause)
 
               
               So how about that Kramer, huh?

               
                             AUDREY
               How about him?

               
                             GEORGE
               They way he just says stuff.

               
                             AUDREY
               He sure does.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
 
               
               
                             AUDREY
               So, what did you think?

               
                             GEORGE
               About the pizza?

               
                             AUDREY
               No, about the nose job.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what 
               did you think?
 
               
                             AUDREY
               Well, I've thought about it, but I don't 
               know.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, 
               one way or the other, but
 
               
               these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you 
               were so inclined.
 
               
               And again, I'm not suggesting.

               
                             AUDREY
               I know, they're good.

               
                             GEORGE
               Peter Jennings had one.

               
                             AUDREY
               Really?

               
                             GEORGE
               Probably. They all do. In my high school, 
               half my graduating class
 
               
               had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...

               
                             AUDREY
               Uh huh.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's really nothing, it's like going 
               to the dentist.
 
               
                             AUDREY
               I hate the dentist.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's a cleaning.

               
                             AUDREY
               So you really think I should do this?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               If it makes you happy, I don't focus 
               on these things. I will tell you
 
               
                             THIS
               Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial 
               society. I don't condone
 
               
               it, but it's a fact of life.

               
                             AUDREY
               Well, maybe I should.

               
                             GEORGE
               What the hell.

               
                             ELAINE
               Aw, now you talked her into getting 
               a nose job?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Me? I didn't say anything.

               
                             ELAINE
               You encouraged her to get one.

               
                             GEORGE
               I didn't encourage. No encourage.

               
                             ELAINE
               Peter Jennings had one?

               
                             GEORGE
               It's possible.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, I think you should accept her 
               for who she is.
 
               
                             AUDREY
               No, George is right. I want to get one.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I think it's a mistake.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me too, really. Unless you'd really 
               like to get one.
 
               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm going straight to hell, no two ways 
               about it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, it might not be hell but you're 
               gonna run into some bad dudes.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, let's get the check, she's taking 
               the
 
               
               bandages off at four o'clock.

               
                             JERRY
               We have time.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna 
               have a whole new face.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It is exciting.

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course, not as exciting as miss crop 
               circles, but...
 
               
                             JERRY
               Please, please, Isabel? She is the most 
               despicable woman I have ever
 
               
               met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally 
               and so
 
               
               attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain 
               is facing my
 
               
               penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.

               
                             GEORGE
               You're not letting him win. He wins 
               till you're forty.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Then what?

               
                             GEORGE
               He still wins but it's not a blowout.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               She wants to be an actress. She makes 
               me read these moronic acting
 
               
               scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, 
               I'm helpless,
 
               
               I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
 
               
               
               (flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment)

               
                             JERRY
               I don't want to see this woman anymore 
               but
 
               
               I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, 
               help me. Help
 
               
               me.

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm proud of you.

               
               (end of flashback)

               
                             JERRY
               So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm 
               going cold turkey.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Good for you.

               
                             JERRY
               I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I 
               was like an animal. I mean it was
 
               
               
               just completely uninhibited.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's like going to the bathroom in front 
               of a lot of people and not
 
               
               caring.

               
                             JERRY
               It's not like that at all.

               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               How do you even know the jacket is there?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Well I don't, I'm guessing.

               
                             GEORGE
               Okay, look, Audrey, before you take 
               the bandage off just remember that
 
               
               
               I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that 
               you're gonna
 
               
               be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, 
               like if you'd
 
               
               listened to your friend, Elaine,

               
                             AUDREY
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah?

               
                             AUDREY
               Enough.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's 
               get this show on the road.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Are you sure you want us here for this?
 
               
               
                             AUDREY
               Yes.

               
                             JERRY
               Shouldn't a doctor do it?

               
                             AUDREY
               No, he said I could do it. Okay, here 
               goes.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Very exciting, very exciting, it's like 
               watching a birth.
 
               
               Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their 
               horror.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               It looks good.

               
                             JERRY
               Great job.

               
                             KRAMER
               You got butchered.

               
               George faints.

               
               An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George 
               to his feet.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Let's put him over here.

               
                             KRAMER
               Where are you going?

               
                             AUDREY
               To the doctor!

               
                             KRAMER
               Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
 
               
               
               Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George.

               
                             ELAINE
               How ya feeling?

               
                             GEORGE
               Too much salt in my diet.

               
                             ELAINE
               Can I get you anything?

               
                             GEORGE
               Nah, I'm good.

               
                             ELAINE
               You sure? Anything?

               
                             GEORGE
               Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come 
               out too well, did it?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's like, all dented.

               
                             ELAINE
               Seems to be.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix 
               it. You can't stop modern
 
               
               science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. 
               Can't be
 
               
               stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--

               
                             ELAINE
               Shut up, George.

               
                             GEORGE
               Shut up?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               Interesting.

               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring 
               a bowl of cereal,
 
               
               Jerry has cracked.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me 
               her number!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I don't have it, I threw it out.

               
                             JERRY
               You're lying! You got it, I want that 
               number!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I told you, I threw it out.

               
                             JERRY
               Give it to me!

               
                             KRAMER
               You told me not to give it to you, you 
               made me promise.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I changed my mind, I want that 
               number.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You said, no matter what you do or say, 
               I'm not to give you the number.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I was lying, give it to me!

               
                             KRAMER
               No, you told me not to!

               
                             JERRY
               I want that number!

               
                             KRAMER
               Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper 
               to the ground) Yeah! Yeah!
 
               
               Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) 
               Look at you!
 
               
               Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look 
               in the mirror,
 
               
               cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand 
               by and do it
 
               
               anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching 
               you
 
               
               destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!

               
               Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal 
               and the bowl,
 
               
               then storms out again.

               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about 
               her nose,
 
               
               George is trying not to look at it.

               
                             AUDREY
               The doctor said that they need to build 
               the lateral wall of the septum.
 
               
               Over here...

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             AUDREY
               You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, I got it.

               
                             AUDREY
               You see how it's collapsing? That's 
               what's causing this huge dent.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, phew.

               
                             AUDREY
               So anyway, George, do you know what 
               I was thinking about?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             AUDREY
               Remember we talked about taking a trip 
               together?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               We did?

               
                             AUDREY
               Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hawaii?

               
                             AUDREY
               Anyway, I think it would be great to 
               get away after all this.
 
               
               George (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little 
               tricky right
 
               
               now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time 
               of year, there's
 
               
               a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, 
               pretty dangerous.
 
               
                             AUDREY
               I never heard that.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh yeah. My friend lived there.

               
                             AUDREY
               We could go to the Caribbean.

               
                             GEORGE
               You know, I have to tell you something. 
               You couldn't get me on a plane
 
               
               right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them 
               to me, he
 
               
               used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's 
               the word there,
 
               
               uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't 
               let that stop you
 
               
               from going. You could go. I don't mind.

               
                             AUDREY
               George, I don't think this is working.
 
               
               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.

               
                             ISABEL
               Ever since you came back from the Army, 
               you've changed. I swear
 
               
               Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm Nelson!

               
                             ISABEL
               That's not the line, Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) 
               Nothing's changed, Alma, I just
 
               
               need more time.

               
                             ISABEL
               I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, 
               when you're not around, I just go
 
               
               
               crazy thinking about you.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, you just need to relax. Maybe 
               a hobby, bowling is fun.
 
               
                             ISABEL
               Yeah, bowling's good if you're really 
               gross and ugly.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
 
               
               
               
               
               Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is 
               playing chess
 
               
               with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               Well I'm getting a little tired of this. 
               What do you say we
 
               
               play one for all the marbles?

               
                             JERRY'S PENIS
               Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot 
               beat me. Do you have
 
               
               any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               I can't take her anymore. I hate reading 
               her stupid little
 
               
               acting scenes.

               
                             JERRY'S PENIS
               Oh, so what? So you read from a little 
               play. You can't put up
 
               
               with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give 
               me one hour,
 
               
               then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest 
               of the night.
 
               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               What about tomorrow morning? Do you 
               have any idea what that's
 
               
               like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you 
               get to do
 
               
               whatever it is you do. You disgust me.

               
                             JERRY'S PENIS
               Oh, go read a book.

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               Enough chatting, let's play.

               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.

               
                             ELAINE
               You know the only reason I'm doing this 
               is because you took Audrey to
 
               
               the hospital.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, 
               you got
 
               
               everything?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             KRAMER
               Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a 
               ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What do I need this for?

               
                             KRAMER
               Because we're engaged.

               
                             ELAINE
               We're engaged?

               
                             KRAMER
               Um hm.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer, this is too big.

               
                             KRAMER
               It's my mom's.

               
               A stout man walks around the corner.

               
                             LANDLORD
               Hello?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert 
               Pepper's daughter. My father
 
               
               asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.

               
                             LANDLORD
               Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure 
               to meet you. (To Kramer) And
 
               
               you must be Professor Von Nostrand?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yes, yes I am.

               
                             LANDLORD
               I've read your book, Professor, and 
               I was quite intrigued by it.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
 
               
               
                             LANDLORD
               Tell me, is it your contention that 
               Shakespeare was an imposter?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               My contention?

               
                             LANDLORD
               Yes, your contention.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yes, that's my contention.

               
                             ELAINE
               I heard him contend that.

               
                             LANDLORD
               It's too bad about your father.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, it was a frame-up.

               
                             LANDLORD
               A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's 
               very proud of the work
 
               
               you're doing.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, well, we're all proud of the work 
               I'm doing.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               She does fine work.

               
                             LANDLORD
               Your father gave me strict orders not 
               to turn the jacket over to
 
               
               anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The 
               closet's this
 
               
               way.

               
                             ELAINE
               How kind of you.

               
                             LANDLORD
               You know, your father has a very extensive 
               wardrobe.
 
               
               Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.
 
               
               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain 
               appears to have
 
               
               the upper hand.

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               What's the matter, fella? You look a 
               little tired. Ha ha ha ha
 
               
               ha!

               
                             ISABEL
               Nelson, don't you see? You are a part 
               of me, and I, I am a part of
 
               
               you.

               
                             JERRY'S PENIS
               It's killing me. (Makes a move)

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               That's your move?

               
                             JERRY'S PENIS
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               Well that's trouble, my friend. That's 
               big trouble. Checkmate!
 
               
                             JERRY'S PENIS
               Getting weak... Losing

               
               power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're 
               nothing
 
               
               without me. Nothing!

               
               Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop.

               
                             JERRY'S BRAIN
               Punk.

               
                             JERRY
               Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
 
               
               
               Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face.

               
               
               
               Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Daddy certainly does have an extensive 
               wardrobe.
 
               
                             LANDLORD
               He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I 
               don't have to tell you he's quite
 
               
               
               popular with the ladies.

               
                             ELAINE
               My father, really? I had no idea.

               
                             LANDLORD
               Yes, they're crazy about him. There 
               was one in particular, came
 
               
               around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. 
               Could have been
 
               
               your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's 
               it, Babs
 
               
               Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the 
               street, drunken
 
               
               stumblebum.

               
                             KRAMER
               You don't say?

               
                             ELAINE
               I found it!

               
                             LANDLORD
               The woman used to walk around here half 
               naked, sucking Colt 45 from a
 
               
               can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her 
               knees,
 
               
               screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy 
               ape, and bring
 
               
               back that box of Danish!"

               
               Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and 
               more agitated.
 
               
               Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.

               
               
               
               New scene.

               
               The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.

               
                             KRAMER
               So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, 
               you're killing him!"
 
               
                             JERRY
               So I assume the jig was up.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, pretty much.

               
               Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the 
               jacket. Audrey
 
               
               walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful.
 
               
               
                             AUDREY
               Hi.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hi!

               
                             JERRY
               Hey.

               
                             AUDREY
               Hello.

               
                             GEORGE
               Audrey? My god, you look incredible! 
               I can't believe it!
 
               
                             AUDREY
               Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               So, will I see you later tonight?

               
                             AUDREY
               Not sure.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, I'll check

               
               you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?

               
                             AUDREY
               I didn't wash.

               Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae 
               Lounge.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in 
               such perfect
 
               
               proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who 
               would have
 
               
               though she's like--

               
                             GEORGE
               Elaine. Shut up.

               The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? 
               Do we really
 
               need to insult the person at this particular moment of their 
               lives? They know
 
               they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really 
               need the
 
               abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything 
               else? When someone
 
               goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to 
               perform a
 
               cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to 
               remove the
 
               skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."
 
               
               
               
               
                                   THE END

               Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. 
               "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They
               can't all be the best. 
 
               There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom 
               of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying 
               to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah,
               he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got,
               it'll be worse after you see him. 
 
               He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."? And then there's 
               always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." 
               Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! 
               Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."

               ...And usually for lunch I'll have a 
               salad, and for dinner, I eat
 
               whatever I want.

               
                             JERRY
               What do you think the worst part of 
               being blind is?
 
               
                             JULIANNA
               Excuse me?

               
                             JERRY
               You know, if you were blind what do 
               you think the worst part of it would
 
               
               be?

               
                             JULIANNA
               I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               I think it would be not being able to 
               tell if there was bugs in my food. 
 
               
               How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be 
               feeling around
 
               with my lips and my tongue.

               
                             JULIANNA
               Well that's how my five-year old eats. 
               He's a very picky eater.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You hear about that kid that was kidnapped 
               the other day in
 
               Pennsylvania?

               
                             JULIANNA
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               He was at a carnival with his mother. 
               She goes to get a hot dog, next
 
               thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.

               
                             JULIANNA
               Oh.

               
                             JERRY
               Imagine how sick a person has to be 
               to do something like that. And
 
               these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, 
               I could be one
 
               of these people.

               
                             JULIANNA
               Have you seen any good movies?

               
                             JERRY
               Who takes care of your boy during the 
               day?
 
               
                             JULIANNA
               We have a woman. Why?

               
                             JERRY
               No no. I'm just saying.

               
                             JULIANNA
               She had references.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. 
               I'm talking about the
 
               ones that forge them. You know I think this is really helping.
 
               
               
                             JULIANNA
               I don't live near here, ya know!

               
               
               
               
               Jerry, Elaine and George are at Jerry's apartment.

               
                             JERRY
               So she's giving me the massage and I'm 
               just making conversation.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I don't like to talk during a massage.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Neither do I, but I do it for them. 
               I figure they're bored.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about 
               getting the pleasure. I feel
 
               like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying 
               it. There's
 
               nothing to eat in here.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh! I forgot to tell you--

               
                             JERRY
               I'm in the middle of a story.

               
                             ELAINE
               Okay, go ahead.

               
                             GEORGE
               Why don't you ever go shopping?

               
                             JERRY
               Not like it's a really funny story or 
               anything.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What happened?

               
                             JERRY
               Well so she mentioned that she had a 
               son, and the for some reason I
 
               launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was 
               abducted.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, wasn't that terrible?

               
                             JERRY
               Yes, it was.

               
                             GEORGE
               Not even an apple.

               
                             ELAINE
               She doesn't want to hear that, that 
               was stupid.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I know it was stupid.

               
                             ELAINE
               Really stupid.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, I just said it was stupid.

               
                             GEORGE
               What about this leftover Chinese food?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Take it.

               
                             ELAINE
               I can't believe you said that.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, would you stop it already?

               
                             ELAINE
               So, what did she say?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, she actually seemed to 
               get a little paranoid.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               This is terrible. What is this, ginger? 
               I hate ginger. I can't
 
               understand how anyone can eat ginger.

               
                             ELAINE
               I have a good masseuse you could go 
               to.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Nah, she's really good and she's not 
               just a masseuse, she's a physical
 
               
               therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, 
               it's a real
 
               medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's 
               covered by
 
               insurance.

               
                             GEORGE
               Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               You don't have to pay for the massage?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Not if you have a doctor's note.

               
                             ELAINE
               So where do you get this note?

               
                             JERRY
               Well I've never actually done it but 
               if I really wanted to I could
 
               probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.

               
                             GEORGE
               Right, your friend Roy.

               
                             ELAINE
               What's the name of this physical therapist?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything 
               about her kid, she a little
 
               off.

               
                             GEORGE
               And you don't have to pay.

               
               
               
               George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office.

               
                             GEORGE
               We have three-o'clock appointments.
 
               
               
                             RECEPTIONIST
               George and Elaine, right? Could you 
               fill these out for me
 
               please? And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll 
               be with
 
               Raymond.

               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?

               
                             RECEPTIONIST
               Yes.

               
                             GEORGE
               But, uh, Raymond is a man.

               
                             RECEPTIONIST
               That's right.

               
               George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't get a massage from a man.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why not?

               
                             GEORGE
               What, are you crazy? I can't have a 
               man touching me. Switch with me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, I don't want the man either.

               
                             GEORGE
               What's the difference, you're a woman. 
               They're supposed to be touching
 
               you.

               
                             ELAINE
               He'd just be touching your back.

               
                             GEORGE
               He'd just be touching your back too.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No, it could get sexual.

               
                             GEORGE
               I know. That's the point. If it's gonna 
               get sexual, it should get
 
               sexual with you.

               
                             ELAINE
               I wouldn't be comfortable.

               
                             GEORGE
               I would? What if something happens?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What could happen?

               
                             GEORGE
               What if it felt good?

               
                             ELAINE
               It's supposed to feel good.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't want it to feel good.

               
                             ELAINE
               Then why get the massage?

               
                             GEORGE
               Exactly!

               
               A man walks up dressed in white.

               
                             RAYMOND
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes?

               
                             RAYMOND
               I'm Raymond.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hello.

               
                             RAYMOND
               Are you ready?

               
               George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.

               
               
               
               George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George 
               appears extremely
 
               uncomfortable.

               
                             RAYMOND
               ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted 
               to join her here in the
 
               office.

               
                             GEORGE
               Really.

               
                             RAYMOND
               I used to be a flight attendant.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh boy.

               
                             RAYMOND
               Ya know, why don't you open those pants, 
               it's gonna be a lot easier
 
               that way.

               
               George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down 
               his hips then
 
               starts massaging his lower back.

               
                             RAYMOND
               So what do you do?

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             RAYMOND
               I said, 'What do you do?'.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know.

               
                             RAYMOND
               You don't know what you do?

               
                             GEORGE
               Nah.

               
                             RAYMOND
               Oh, come on. Hey, you're very tense.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Coffee. Too much coffee.

               
                             RAYMOND
               Okay, just take off those pants now, 
               I'll work the hamstring.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, the hamstring's fine.

               
                             RAYMOND
               But you wrote that it was tender.

               
                             GEORGE
               I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.

               
                             RAYMOND
               I'll check it out.

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you sure?

               
                             RAYMOND
               Yeah, take 'em off.

               
               George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond 
               rubbing his
 
               hands with oil. Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs 
               back on the
 
               table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid 
               with
 
               discomfort.

               
                             RAYMOND
               How did you hurt this?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know.

               
                             RAYMOND
               You don't know?

               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             RAYMOND
               But you just told me--

               
                             GEORGE
               Korea.

               
                             RAYMOND
               You hurt it in Korea?

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             RAYMOND
               The hamstring.

               
                             GEORGE
               Korea.

               
                             RAYMOND
               How?

               
                             GEORGE
               Hamstring.

               
                             RAYMOND
               How did you hurt the hamstring?

               
                             GEORGE
               Hotel.

               
               
               
               Elaine is in the waiting room, George walks out very slowly, 
               he appears
 
               positively shell-shocked.

               
                             ELAINE
               How'd it go? George?

               
               George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.

               
               
               
               Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.

               
                             JERRY
               No appointments at all? Because my neck 
               is still tight. What about
 
               Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.

               
               George enters acting nervous.

               
                             JERRY
               What's with you?

               
                             GEORGE
               A...

               
                             JERRY
               Yes, A...?

               
                             GEORGE
               A man gave me...

               
                             JERRY
               Yes, a man gave you...?

               
                             GEORGE
               A man gave me... a massage.

               
                             JERRY
               So?

               
                             GEORGE
               So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               He was what?!

               
                             GEORGE
               He was... touching and rubbing.

               
                             JERRY
               That's a massage.

               
                             GEORGE
               And then I took my pants off.

               
                             JERRY
               You took your pants off?

               
                             GEORGE
               For my hamstring.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh.

               
                             GEORGE
               He got about two inches from... there.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Really?

               
                             GEORGE
               I think it moved.

               
                             JERRY
               Moved?

               
                             GEORGE
               It may have moved, I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm sure it didn't move.

               
                             GEORGE
               It moved! It was imperceptible but I 
               felt it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Maybe it just wanted to change positions? 
               You know, shift to the other
 
               side.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, 
               this was a move.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Okay, so what if it moved?

               
                             GEORGE
               That's the sign! The test; if a man 
               makes it move.
 
               
                             JERRY
               That's not the test. Contact is the 
               test, if it moves as a result of
 
               contact.

               
                             GEORGE
               You think it's contact? It has to be 
               touched?
 
               
                             JERRY
               That's what a gym teacher once told 
               me.
 
               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey.

               
                             KRAMER
               I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. 
               You know, I looked in there
 
               and there he was having coffee and a donut.

               
                             JERRY
               Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut 
               he goes to a fancy restaurant
 
               or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't even like to sit next to a man 
               on an airplane 'cause our knees
 
               might touch.

               
                             JERRY
               I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at 
               the counter in little tiny filthy
 
               
               smelly Dinky Donuts.

               
                             KRAMER
               Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut 
               like everyone else?
 
               
                             JERRY
               He can have a donut, but not at Dinky.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't even like to use urinals, I've 
               always been a stall man.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Look I'm telling-- (he does a double 
               take and looks at George) I'm
 
               telling you, that was Joe DiMaggio.

               
                             GEORGE
               The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's 
               in Dinky Donuts. What about
 
               this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.

               
                             JERRY
               I never said I'd do that.

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you talking about, that's seventy-five 
               bucks! I'm not
 
               working, I can't afford that.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know how I feel about it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Alright, alright.

               
                             KRAMER
               A stall man, huh?

               
               
               
               George and Jerry are in Roy's office.

               
                             JERRY
               ...so we were just kinda wondering if 
               it was possible for you to write
 
               us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.

               
                             GEORGE
               He didn't say he can't.

               
                             JERRY
               I mean, if you feel funny about it at 
               all.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He doesn't feel funny.

               
                             JERRY
               If he does.

               
                             GEORGE
               Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               He feels funny. You don't have to do 
               this.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He knows that!

               
                             JERRY
               Roy, should we go? Is this a breach 
               of our friendship?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

               
                             ROY
               Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George 
               looking at a poster on the wall) 
 
               
               Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got 
               a hell of a
 
               body, doesn't he?

               
                             GEORGE
               How would I know?

               
                             ROY
               Do you like him?

               
                             GEORGE
               What do you mean, like him?

               
                             ROY
               Do you like him?

               
                             GEORGE
               I mean he's a good fighter and a nice 
               guy but I don't like him.
 
               
                             ROY
               How come you don't like him?

               
                             GEORGE
               Why should I?

               
                             JERRY
               What is the matter with you?

               
                             GEORGE
               Nothing, why? You think something's 
               wrong? Am I different?
 
               
                             ROY
               So, you want the notes?

               
                             JERRY
               You don't have to, really.

               
                             ROY
               Nah nah, it's ok.

               
                             JERRY
               We should probably get one for Elaine, 
               too, right George? (turns to
 
               George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
 
               
               
               
               
               Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well what about the week after? No appointments 
               at all? (Jerry tries
 
               to sit down on the couch, but Elaine is too close to the end 
               and he has to
 
               squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down) Can I at least 
               just talk to her
 
               so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, 
               I make one
 
               innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut 
               off. This woman
 
               is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               Well you were too close to me, I was 
               all scrunched in there.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here 
               first.
 
               
               Kramer enters.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop 
               again.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Uh huh.

               
                             ELAINE
               Joe DiMaggio?

               
                             KRAMER
               Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went 
               in and sat down across from him
 
               and I really watched him. I studied his every move. For example, 
               he dunks.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?

               
                             KRAMER
               That's right.

               
                             JERRY
               See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio 
               could not be a dunker.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, he's a dunker.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why couldn't he be a dunker?

               
                             KRAMER
               And nothing diverts his attention. Like, 
               I'm uh, you know, like I'm
 
               sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, 
               you know, to uh,
 
               look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* 
               (slams the
 
               table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing 
               these yelping
 
               noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction 
               because
 
               the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything 
               that's going on
 
               around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like 
               he hits.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               So then what?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, then the waitress, she comes up 
               and she tells me to shut up or
 
               they're gonna throw me out.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why didn't you just call out his name?
 
               
               
               George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee.

               
                             JERRY
               What happened to you?

               
                             GEORGE
               One of those kids called me a Mary.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               A what?

               
                             GEORGE
               I was jumping over a puddle and for 
               some reason I went like this.
 
               (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) They called 
               me a Mary. So I
 
               chased them, and I tripped and I fell.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, you know kids, they can be very 
               perceptive.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, George? What is this? (Elaine makes 
               the same outstretched arm
 
               motion) What is that? No really, what is that?

               
               George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers 
               it, Jerry grabs
 
               it from him.

               
                             JERRY
               Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god, 
               how did this happen? What can I
 
               do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's 
               under
 
               investigation for insurance fraud.

               
                             KRAMER
               ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' 
               Joe DiMaggio. Joe,
 
               Joe. Go, Joe...

               
                             JERRY
               I told you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Told me what?

               
                             JERRY
               I told you we shouldn't do it.

               
                             GEORGE
               He didn't say anything.

               
                             JERRY
               He's got a house, a family, they could 
               take away his license. You
 
               should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never 
               should have
 
               got three notes.

               
                             ELAINE
               Three notes?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, you, me and George.

               
                             ELAINE
               You got me a note?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             ELAINE
               But I got my own note.

               
                             JERRY
               You what?

               
                             ELAINE
               I got a note from my gynecologist.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Why'd you do that?

               
                             ELAINE
               I didn't know you were getting me a 
               note.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Of course I was getting you a note.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               But you didn't say anything.

               
                             JERRY
               Neither did you, that's how he got caught. 
               We sent in four notes from
 
               two doctors.

               
                             KRAMER
               How can you do that to your friend? 
               He's got a wife, kids, and a lot
 
               of other stuff. Oh, yeah.

               
               Kramer leaves.

               
               
               
               Jerry and George are at Roy's office.

               
                             JERRY
               Hi Pam.

               
                             PAM
               Hello.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hello.

               
                             JERRY
               I just thought maybe I could talk to 
               Roy.
 
               
               Roy walks in.

               
                             ROY
               Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... 
               Hi.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hi Roy.

               
                             GEORGE
               How ya doing?

               
                             ROY
               Come on back, I have a patient but she's 
               under.
 
               
               
               
               Roy, Jerry and George are talking over a woman sleeping in a 
               dental chair.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't even know what to say.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me neither.

               
                             JERRY
               I knew this would happen.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me too.

               
                             JERRY
               I mean the whole thing, it's just...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Tragic.

               
                             JERRY
               Well it's not tragic.

               
                             GEORGE
               No?

               
                             JERRY
               No, it's...

               
                             GEORGE
               Unsettling?

               
                             JERRY
               Okay. I mean, what if the--

               
               Pam walks in and interrupts.

               
                             PAM
               I hope you're both happy.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm not happy.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me neither. I've never been happy.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I mean I'm happy sometimes, but not 
               now.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, college was fun.

               
               Pam walks in again and interjects.

               
                             PAM
               You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, 
               you know that?
 
               
                             ROY
               Don't mind her.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh please, I love her.

               
                             GEORGE
               I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
 
               
               
                             ROY
               I can't understand, I've never had a 
               problem with these notes before.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What's the next move, what's gonna happen 
               now?
 
               
                             ROY
               Well, nothing really, as long as we 
               get the physical therapist to go along
 
               
               with our story.

               
                             JERRY
               What? The physical therapist? Why?
 
               
               
                             ROY
               She just has to say the complaint was 
               related to a dental problem.
 
               
               The woman in the chair wakes up and looks at Jerry and George.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               How ya doing?

               
               
               
               Jerry and George are at Julianna's office.

               
                             JERRY
               Hi. Look, I know I don't have an appointment 
               but it's really important
 
               that I talk with Julianna.

               
                             RECEPTIONIST
               I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not it.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I know she's mad at me but I really 
               have to speak with her.
 
               
                             RECEPTIONIST
               I told you, she's not here.

               
                             JERRY
               You don't understand.

               
                             RECEPTIONIST
               Look, you have to leave.

               
                             JERRY
               Wait a second, don't you-- (Julianna 
               walks up with her child) Hi. Hi. 
 
               
               Look, I don't know what you--

               
                             JULIANNA
               Please!

               
                             JERRY
               --but, you see, let me just talk to 
               you for a second, see, what I did is
 
               
               inadvertently sent an insurance--

               
                             JULIANNA
               I treated you, so please, just get out 
               of the office!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Can't you just listen to me?

               
                             JULIANNA
               Run Billy! Run to the office and close 
               the
 
               door! (to the receptionist) Call the police!

               
               Julianna then runs down the hall.

               
                             JERRY
               The police?

               
               Raymond the masseuse walks up.

               
                             RAYMOND
               Hi George.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hello.

               
                             JERRY
               Raymond?

               
               
               
               Elaine, Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, I mean it's only six months probation, 
               it's a slap on the wrist.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations 
               forthcoming.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Men have been popping into my sexual 
               fantasies. All of a sudden, I'll
 
               be in the middle.

               
                             ELAINE
               Of what? Oh.

               
                             GEORGE
               And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. 
               I say "Get out of here! 
 
               What do you want? You don't belong here!"

               
                             ELAINE
               What do they do?

               
                             GEORGE
               They talk back. They go, "Hey George, 
               how's it going?" I say, "Get
 
               the hell out of here!"

               
               Jerry spots Kramer through the window.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the 
               glass to get Kramer's attention) 
 
               
               Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.

               
               Kramer enters and sits at the booth.

               
                             KRAMER
               I just came from Roy's. I threw up from 
               the gas.
 
               
               The three all put down their coffee cups simultaneously.

               
                             JERRY
               Did he say anything?

               
                             KRAMER
               No no, he's fine.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh my god, it's...

               
                             GEORGE
               Joe DiMaggio.

               
                             KRAMER
               Where?

               
                             JERRY
               Having a cup of coffee.

               
                             ELAINE
               He's dunking!

               
                             JERRY
               Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper. 
               Here.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You see? Now that is a handsome man. 
               (Elaine and Jerry look right at
 
               George) Oh please.

               
                             KRAMER
               Wait, wait. *bang* (he slams his hand 
               down on the table) *bang*
 
               (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* See? 
               I told you.
 
               
               
               (Closing monologue)

               
               What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual 
               man worry? I 
               think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales 
               resistance. We're 
               constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. 
               Men think, 
               "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally 
               wander into 
               some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and 
               the salesman 
               goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little 
               bit, see how 
               you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you 
               like to see him in a sandal?'"

                             KRAMER
               You can have this one.

               No, that's not enough BTUs for my living

               time.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, I didn't get one either.

               Why do I always have the feeling that 
               everybody's doing something better than 
               me on Saturday afternoons?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               This is what people do.

               
                             JERRY
               No they don't. They're out on some big 
               picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're 
               making out on blankets. They're not 
               at some mall in Jersey watching their 
               friends trying to find the world's cheapest 
               air-conditioner.

               You should see what my father used to 
               go through before he bought a car. He'd 
               go from state to state. He was away 
               for weeks at a time. It was like he 
               was running for President and he was 
               going through the primaries. We'd get 
               phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               So we took a little ride. What's the 
               big deal?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well at least you accomplished something. 
               You got fish.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Big accomplishment. GEORGE Fish. What 
               do they do?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What do you do?

               
                             KRAMER
               (RE: CAR) It's this way.

               
                             GEORGE
               What time is it?

               
                             JERRY
               Five o'clock.

               
                             GEORGE
               Always late. Always late.

               
                             JERRY
               You're not late.

               
                             GEORGE
               I told them to meet me in front of my 
               building at six-fifteen.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Who?

               
                             GEORGE
               My parents. It's their anniversary. 
               I'm taking them out to dinner and a 
               show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush 
               hour.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Isn't it going the other way?

               
                             JERRY
               There is no other way in New York. Everybody 
               goes every way all the time.
 
               
               ELAINE But it's Saturday. JERRY You got the picnic and burger 
               traffic. GEORGE I always get myself in this position. Can't be 
               on time. Gotta rush.
 
               
               KRAMER STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND.

               
                             ELAINE
               What's the matter?

               
               HE MUMBLES SOMETHING AND CONTINUES WALKING.

               
                             JERRY
               I have to go to the bathroom. Why do 
               they hide the bathroom in these malls?
 
               
               
               KRAMER STUMBLES WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER.

               
                             JERRY
               You want me to help you with that?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               No, no, I got it.

               
               AND HE STUMBLES AGAIN. JERRY SPOTS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

               
                             JERRY
               (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, 
               Georgie boy?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Did I need that pointed out for me? 
               What is that going to do for me? How 
               does that help me, to see her? I'm trying 
               to live my life. Don't show me that.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               If you like her, go talk to her.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, 
               "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a 
               glass of white wine?"
 
               
                             JERRY
               Before you got within twenty feet of 
               this woman, she'd have her finger on 
               the mace button. She's like an expensive 
               car with one of those motion-sensor 
               force field alarms. Any sudden movement 
               in the area could set her off.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               She's fat.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh she's fat?

               
               KRAMER STOPS AGAIN, CONFUSED.

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               Where's the car?

               
                             KRAMER
               I thought it was here.

               
                             GEORGE
               You don't know where we parked?

               
               KRAMER LOOKS AROUND, THEN RESUMES WALKING. THEY FOLLOW.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, this is great.

               
                             KRAMER
               Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I thought it was green. I remember seeing 
               green.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I didn't pay attention.

               
                             GEORGE
               This is just what I need.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sure it's right around here.

               
                             KRAMER
               It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               There's elevators all over! It all looks 
               the same.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's over there. I know where it is.
 
               
               
               NOW JERRY TAKES THE LEAD AND THE OTHERS FOLLOW.

               
                             ELAINE
               It's black, right?

               
                             KRAMER
               Dark blue.

               
                             GEORGE
               You come to a parking lot, you write 
               it down. How hard is that?
 
               
                             JERRY
               There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
 
               
               
               THEY STOP...

               
                             JERRY
               Hmmm...I thought it was...

               
                             KRAMER
               Didn't we come in over there?

               
                             JERRY
               I thought it was over there.

               
                             ELAINE
               How long can fish live in one of these 
               plastic bags?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               About two hours.

               
                             ELAINE
               You'd better find this car.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's this way...

               
                             JERRY
               I really have to go to the bathroom.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Why don't you go behind one of these 
               cars? J
 
               
               JERRY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.

               
                             KRAMER
               Why? Nobody's around.

               
                             JERRY
               I'll wait.

               
                             KRAMER
               You know when you hold it in like that 
               you can cause a lot of damage to your 
               bladder. That's what happens to truck 
               drivers. They hold it in all the time. 
               Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. 
               JERRY Alright.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers 
               are a six hundred million dollar a year 
               industry?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Maybe I should just go anytime I get 
               the urge like you...wherever I am. There's 
               too much urinary freedom in this society. 
               I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
 
               
               
               ANGLE ON ELAINE AND GEORGE...

               
                             ELAINE
               There it is!...No that's not it.

               
               A CAR SCREECHES AROUND A CURVE, ELAINE IS UNNERVED.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? 
               Maniac. Can you explain something to 
               me? I got six questions wrong on my 
               drivers test. That's the maximum. I 
               read the book, I'm a college graduate. 
               This is a country where fifty percent 
               of its high school students can't locate 
               Europe on a map. How are they all passing 
               that test? It's a mystery.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               ...Six wrong?

               
                             ELAINE
               Those school zones are a killer.

               
                             JERRY
               Will you let me help you with that?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
 
               
               
               HE DOES SO.

               
                             JERRY
               You're not worried somebody's gonna 
               pee on it?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Pink eleven. Remember that.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed 
               to remember. Where the car is, that's 
               insignificant.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Look at this place. It's huge...

               
                             GEORGE
               I can tell you this. If I am not in 
               front of my house at six-fifteen, when 
               my parents get there, they will put 
               me on an aggravation installment plan 
               that will compound with interest for 
               decades.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Parents never forget a foul-up. I once 
               left a jacket on the bus when I was 
               fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago 
               to do a show, "Make sure you hang on 
               to your jacket."
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               It's got to be here.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why are they using so many colors? And 
               the numbers go up to forty.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Maybe it's not on this level.

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               There are four different levels. Maybe 
               we're on the wrong level. How long was 
               the escalator ride up?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               It felt like a couple of levels.

               
                             JERRY
               You should always carry a pad and pen. 
               GEORGE I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid 
               I'll puncture my scrotum.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I have a pen.

               
               THEY REACT...

               
                             JERRY
               Where was the bathroom in this mall? 
               There are six-hundred stores, I didn't 
               see one bathroom. What is this, like 
               a joke? They finished building the mall 
               and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the 
               bathrooms."
 
               
                             MOTHER
               Don't you dare talk to me like that! 
               You hear me?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Look at that woman.

               
               SHE'S HITTING HER BOY ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

               
                             MOTHER
               I told you! I don't care! You'll have 
               to wait.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, is that necessary?

               
                             MOTHER
               Why don't you mind your own business?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I think hitting a defenseless child 
               is my business.
 
               
                             KID
               You're ugly.

               
                             GEORGE
               ...What?

               
                             KID
               You're ugly.

               
                             GEORGE
               You are!

               
                             KID
               You are!

               
               THE KID GETS IN THE CAR. GEORGE IS STUNNED.

               
                             GEORGE
               I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. 
               I can't stand kids. Adults think it's 
               so wonderful how honest kids are. I 
               don't need that kind of honesty. I'll 
               take a deceptive adult over an honest 
               kid any day.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               (RE CAR) I found it!

               
                             ELAINE
               He's got it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh...no.

               
                             JERRY
               All right, that's it. From now on no 
               more calling out they found it, unless 
               we're sitting in it. Okay?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, look at my fish.

               
               JERRY HOLDS UP THE BAG AND HITS IT WITH HIS FINGER.

               
                             JERRY
               His eyes look a little cloudy.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh are they gonna be furious.

               
                             JERRY
               Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. 
               (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this 
               mall. You said you'd been here before!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               It was easy the last time.

               
                             ELAINE
               My fish are dying right in front of 
               me! We have to get someone to drive 
               us around the parking lot to help us 
               look for the car.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No one's going to do that.

               
               ELAINE SPOTS A FORTY-ISH, STYLISH COUPLE WALKING TO THEIR CAR.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Excuse me, we can't seem to find our 
               car. I was wondering if it would be 
               possible if you're not in a hurry, to 
               drive us around the garage for five 
               minutes so we can look.
 
               
                             MAN #1
               ...Sorry.

               
                             ELAINE
               Five minutes.

               
                             MAN #1
               Can't do it.

               
                             ELAINE
               We're not wilding.

               
               THEY LEAVE.

               
                             ELAINE
               Excuse me - I can't seem to find my 
               car - do you think you could drive me...
 
               
               
               THEY START LAUGHING.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well 
               tell me if you think this is funny - 
               These fish are dying! They're gasping 
               for oxygen right now! They'll be floating 
               in an hour. Is that funny too?
 
               
               THEY IGNORE HER AND KEEP LAUGHING. CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Those are really ugly sneakers. Where 
               did you get those?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Right here at the mall.

               
               BACK TO ELAINE, SEEKING OUT A MAN WITH A BEARD.

               
                             ELAINE
               Excuse me...

               
               HE IGNORES HER AND KEEPS WALKING.

               
                             ELAINE
               Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly 
               sorry. But the fish will be dead. You 
               do know that. They can't live in plastic. 
               That's not me talking, that's science.
 
               
               
               CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.

               
                             JERRY
               It's amazing how shopping makes me have 
               to go. All I have to do is walk into 
               a department store and it's like some 
               kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               You drank a whole bottle of water.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I know.

               
                             KRAMER
               So why don't you just go?

               
                             JERRY
               No I can't.

               
                             KRAMER
               Don't you get tired of following rules?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You think I'm too cautious?

               
                             KRAMER
               Why be uncomfortable if you don't have 
               to? It's organic.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.

               
                             KRAMER
               Buddy Hackett?

               
                             JERRY
               He's a comedian.

               
                             KRAMER
               I know.

               
                             JERRY
               All right. All right.

               
                             KRAMER
               (pointing) You can go over here.

               
                             JERRY
               I can manage.

               
                             KRAMER
               (turns away and spots George) George! 
               (leaves scene)
 
               
               KRAMER It'll take you ten seconds.

               
               HE NUDGES JERRY.

               
                             JERRY
               Okay, okay. I'll be right back.

               
               WE STAY WITH JERRY AS HE WALKS TO THE BACK OF A CAR, LOOKS AROUND 
               LIKE SUPERMAN, THEN LETS FLY. HE FINISHES, ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS 
               AND SEES A SECURITY GUARD STARING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED.
 
               
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Okay, let's go. Come with me.

               
                             JERRY
               But...

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Come on.

               
                             JERRY
               ...Kramer

               
               INT. SECURITY GUARD'S OFFICE

               
                             JERRY
               I've had this condition since I was 
               eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals 
               my whole life. I have no control over 
               it. Doctors have told me that when I 
               feel it, the best thing to do is just 
               release it. Otherwise, I could die.
 
               
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Well you're still not allowed.

               
                             JERRY
               Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! 
               I'm telling you that if I don't go, 
               I could die. Die. Is it worth dying 
               for?
 
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               That's up to you.

               
                             JERRY
               So you don't care if I die.

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               What I care about is the sanitary condition 
               of the parking facility.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It was life and death.

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Uh huh.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless 
               I was in mortal danger? I know it's 
               against the law.
 
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning 
               and die. That's why!...Do you think 
               I enjoy living like this?...the shame, 
               the humiliation...You know I have been 
               issued a public urination pass by the 
               city because of my condition. Unfortunately 
               my little brother ran out of the house 
               with it this morning.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Him and his friends are probably peeing 
               all over the place. You want to call 
               the Department of Social Services? Oh, 
               it's Saturday. They're closed today. 
               My luck.
 
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               You can tell the police all about it.

                             KRAMER
               Jerry!

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry!

               
                             GEORGE
               Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out 
               of here. The guy goes to pee, he never 
               comes back. It's like a science fiction 
               story.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe he went to one of the other levels. 
               I'll go look for him.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll 
               be back in five minutes.

               If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. 
               We'll find the car, Jerry will show 
               up, and then we'll never find you.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, I'll be back.

                             GEORGE
               Oh what's the difference? We'll all 
               be dead eventually.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Does that bother you?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother 
               you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Not at all.

               
                             GEORGE
               See now that bothers me even more than 
               dying bothers me, cause it's people 
               like you who live to be a hundred and 
               twenty because you're not bothered by 
               it. How could it not bother you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I once saw this thing on T.V. with people 
               who are terminally ill. And they all 
               believed the secret of life is just 
               to live every moment.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile 
               I'm here with you in a parking garage, 
               what am I supposed to do?
 
               
               
               INT. SECURITY OFFICE - JERRY AND THE SECURITY GUARD.

               
                             JERRY
               First of all you don't even know technically 
               that I went. That's for starters. I 
               mean I could've been pouring a bottle 
               of water out there. You don't know.
 
               
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               I know what you did.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens 
               that I did pour water out. I had a bottle 
               of very tepid water and I poured it 
               out. And I could see how you made a 
               mistake, because pouring water out sounds 
               very much like a person urinating.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               And you know when you think about it 
               it's really quite an amusing case of 
               mistaken identity. That's all it is.
 
               
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Yeah I'm sure.

               
                             JERRY
               You know this is not the first time 
               this has happened to me. I always carry 
               water because of my condition. It dehydrates 
               me. It's a vicious cycle.

               And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking 
               for the car. Five minutes, that's all. 
               I just want to find him.

                             MAN #1
               I can't.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, see that's not a reason you can't. 
               You just don't want to.
 
               
                             MAN #1
               That's right.

                             ELAINE
               But wouldn't you get any satisfaction 
               out of helping someone out?
 
               
                             MAN #1
               No, I wouldn't.

               
               
               
               INT. SECURITY SHACK - JERRY (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. 
               I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I 
               obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, 
               the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell 
               you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their 
               fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding 
               anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. 
               They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What I haven't told you, or anyone else 
               for that matter, is that my father's 
               been in a Red Chinese prison for the 
               past fourteen years.

                             KRAMER
               The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector 
               never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty 
               pounds.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Really.

               
                             KRAMER
               What does he do with all that fat? Does 
               he just jump up and down on it? Does 
               he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE

                             KRAMER
               He was a wrestler. He would grab hold 
               of someone's stomach and just squeeze 
               it until they gave.

               great military leaders, General Chang, 
               who by the way came up with the recipe 
               for General Chang's chicken. You know, 
               the one with the red peppers and orange 
               peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, 
               I have it all the time. Very spicy.

               Well General Chang was a very flamboyant 
               man. A complete failure as a general, 
               but a helluva cook.

               See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna

                             GEORGE
               Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents 
               are waiting in front of my building 
               and we're stuck here.
 
               
                             AMY
               I wouldn't want to get lost in here. 
               It smells like a toilet. People are 
               such animals.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, right.

               
                             JERRY
               Filthy pigs.

               
               THEY ALL GET IN THE CAR.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's a blue Honda...

               
                             AMY
               This has happened to me too. It's very 
               frustrating.

               Hi, I'm Elaine.

                             AMY
               Hello.

               
                             ELAINE
               It's very nice of you to do this. I've 
               asked several people and they wouldn't 
               even answer me.
 
               
                             AMY
               I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm 
               Amy.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hi Amy, I'm George.

                             GEORGE
               I didn't mean anything by it. I don't 
               even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know 
               you were...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               ...with that group.

               
                             ELAINE
               What about my fish?

               
                             JERRY
               Boy, those Scientologists. They can 
               be pretty sensitive.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'll say.

               
               THEY TURN TO GEORGE, WHO'S GAPING AT SOMETHING.

               
                             ELAINE
               What is it?

               
                             ELAINE
               The car!

               
                             JERRY
               The car!

               
                             GEORGE
               The car!

               
                             ELAINE
               We found it. I can't believe it!

               
                             GEORGE
               Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. 
               I knew it! I knew this would happen. 
               (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer!

               Kramer.

               
                             KRAMER
               Jerry?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, over here.

               
                             KRAMER
               Boy I had a helluva time finding that 
               air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. 
               I completely forgot where I hid it. 
               You know where it was? GEORGE Purple 
               23.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Sometimes it's good to have a pencil 
               to write these things down.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What time is it?

               
                             GEORGE
               Seven forty-five.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well at least there's no traffic.

               
                             GEORGE
               Right.

               
                             KRAMER
               What time does that play start?

               
                             GEORGE
               Eight o'clock.

               
                             KRAMER
               That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) 
               Where's your little bag of...
 
               
               JERRY INDICATES HE SHOULDN'T PURSUE THAT.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this 
               garage is going to cost a fortune. You 
               know how long we were here?

               At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, 
               isn't that
 
               discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass 
               hanging out of
 
               the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people 
               out there
 
               with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping 
               them. Nobody
 
               goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't 
               pull that in
 
               there."

               
               Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. 
               I think your car got stolen
 
               again.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you talking about?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well you parked it on eighty-fourth 
               and Columbus, right?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yep, well I just walked by there and 
               that car is gone.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah, I know.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, where is it?

               
                             JERRY
               What's the difference?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, there's no difference, you know, 
               I'm just curious.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You always have to know everything that's 
               going on, don't you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What happened to the car?

               
                             JERRY
               If I don't tell you it will kill you, 
               won't it?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.

               
                             JERRY
               You have to know, you must know.

               
                             KRAMER
               I must know.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I'm not telling you.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, come on.

               
                             JERRY
               Nope. I don't think so.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, please?

               
                             JERRY
               Not today, pal.

               
                             KRAMER
               Okay, I beg you.

               
                             JERRY
               Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make 
               it a real beg. You gotta put
 
               some beg into it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Okay, please! Please tell me!

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging 
               needs a lot of work.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.

               
                             JERRY
               I loaned the car to George.

               
                             KRAMER
               Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               George and Elaine went to a flea market 
               in Westchester, okay?!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Alright.

               
                             JERRY
               Huh?

               
                             KRAMER
               Huh. I mean, what do they want to go 
               there for?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Will you stop it already?!

               
                             KRAMER
               You know, why didn't they ask me to 
               go?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What, they don't like me?

               
                             JERRY
               *I* don't like you!

               
                             KRAMER
               If they like me, why don't they ask 
               me to go? Oh yeah.
 
               
               
               
               George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new 
               hat.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I really think it looks good.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?

               
                             GEORGE
               All bald people look good in hats.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               You should have lived in the twenties 
               and thirties, you know men wore
 
               hats all the time then.

               
                             GEORGE
               What a bald paradise that must have 
               been. Nobody knew.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, you can wear a hat all the time 
               now. Who's stopping you?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? 
               I'd always be worried about that
 
               first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment 
               on her
 
               face.

               
                             ELAINE
               Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
 
               
               
               Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses 
               and this
 
               causes George to swerve and hit something.

               
               
               Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well I'm very disappointed in George 
               and Elaine. And you know I'm
 
               somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.

               
                             JERRY
               Why not?

               
                             KRAMER
               Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I 
               don't like you, you've got
 
               problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for 
               the fight?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five 
               minutes.
 
               
               Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. 
               You don't mind, do you?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I like Mike.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, I just got off the phone with 
               him, you know we had a great
 
               conversation.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah? What did you talk about?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. 
               He had some pretty
 
               interesting things to say.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah? What did he say?

               
                             KRAMER
               You have to know everything, don't you?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Why is that? Why do you have to know 
               everything?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Beg me.

               
                             JERRY
               Please, don't make me beg.

               
                             KRAMER
               No no no, I want you to beg me. And 
               I don't want you to say it, I just
 
               
               want you to put some beg into it. Go on.

               
                             JERRY
               Kramer, please tell me what the guy 
               said.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               No no no, that's no good. No, I really 
               don't think that's a beg. No,
 
               it's close, but uh...

               
                             JERRY
               Kramer!

               
                             KRAMER
               Look, I can't say anything. You know, 
               the guy told me the stuff in
 
               confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.

               
                             JERRY
               Well you can't just mention it and then 
               not tell me.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Alright. I'll tell you but you can't 
               say anything to him.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm not saying anything, I'm putting 
               it in the vault, I'm locking the
 
               vault, it's a vault!

               
                             KRAMER
               He thinks you're a phony.

               
                             JERRY
               He what?

               
                             KRAMER
               I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               A phony? He called me a phony?

               
                             KRAMER
               A big phone. A big one.

               
                             JERRY
               Why did you tell me that if I can't 
               say anything?!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You begged me.

               
               
               Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now 
               making a clanking
 
               noise.

               
                             GEORGE
               Do you hear that?

               
                             ELAINE
               Of course I hear that.

               
                             GEORGE
               You had to move the mirror?

               
                             ELAINE
               I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't 
               there. You threw off my
 
               equilibrium.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh yeah, blame it on me because you 
               can't drive, George.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't drive?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing 
               things in this car, you have
 
               no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from 
               the left lane?
 
               Watch this.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, I really don't.

               
                             GEORGE
               And I can make a left turn from the 
               right lane too.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sure you could.

               
                             GEORGE
               What are we gonna tell Jerry about the 
               car?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know.

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, start looking for spaces.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, you're never gonna find a space 
               on Jerry's block, just put it in a
 
               
               garage.

               
                             GEORGE
               Look, I have my system. First I look 
               for the dream spot right in front
 
               
               of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh come on, George, please put it in 
               a garage. I don't want to spend
 
               an hour looking for a space.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't park in a garage.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in 
               my family can pay for parking,
 
               it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, 
               my brother,
 
               nobody. We can't do it.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'll pay for it.

               
                             GEORGE
               You don't understand. A garage. I can't 
               even pull in there. It's
 
               like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply 
               myself, maybe I
 
               could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do 
               you want? Go
 
               around me, I'm looking for spaces.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh George, there's a space right there!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream
 
               
               space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come 
               true, what did
 
               I tell you?

               
                             ELAINE
               You didn't even have to take it out 
               to dinner.
 
               
               They share a laugh.

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel 
               parking. (spitting into
 
               his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make 
               a living
 
               parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, 
               knowing all
 
               the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing 
               it back in,
 
               that's the key.

               
                             ELAINE
               Will you just park it already?

               
                             GEORGE
               There's nothing I can even impart to 
               you, that's the sad thing. It's
 
               so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) 
               Look at this
 
               guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing 
               my space!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               George, wait, you don't know who this 
               guy is, people kill for a parking
 
               
               space in this city.

               
                             GEORGE
               No no no, he's not getting away with 
               this.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               George?

               
               George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, what are you doing?

               
                             MIKE
               I think I'm parking my car.

               
                             GEORGE
               You can't do that, you can't just sneak 
               in from the back like that.
 
               
                             MIKE
               I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know 
               you were parking, you were just
 
               sitting there three spaces up.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well if you didn't think I was parking, 
               why did you put it in head
 
               first?

               
                             MIKE
               Well that's the way I park. Anyway, 
               you didn't start backing in until I
 
               
               pulled in.

               
                             GEORGE
               I was in the middle of a conversation.
 
               
               
                             MIKE
               Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

               
                             GEORGE
               The point is I was here first.

               
                             MIKE
               I was closer to this space than you 
               were.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               But I'm backing in! You can't put it 
               in head first!
 
               
                             MIKE
               I can if I have room!

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you gonna move the car?

               
                             MIKE
               No, I'm not gonna move the car.

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerk!

               
                             MIKE
               Oh, you're not?

               
                             GEORGE
               Do you believe this guy?

               
                             ELAINE
               Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I am not putting it in a garage, it's 
               my space.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What are you gonna do, you just gonna 
               leave it here like this? Uh.
 
               I'm going upstairs.

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you coming back down?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. 
               I gotta go to the bathroom.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, just make sure he reserves 
               the good chair for me. Wait, what
 
               
               are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell 
               him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, come on, you're good at this.

               
                             ELAINE
               What am I gonna say?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know, I don't know, you'll think 
               of something.
 
               
               Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his 
               in retaliation.
 
               
               
               Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts 
               in.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any 
               Hennigan's here?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible 
               what we just went through on the
 
               way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe 
               it. (pushing a
 
               bag of chips off the counter)

               
                             JERRY
               Tell me what happened.

               
               Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted 
               and
 
               the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, 
               this pack of
 
               extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And 
               for some
 
               reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then 
               we payed the
 
               toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow 
               us, alright?!
 
               So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this 
               really like a
 
               souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really 
               suddenly and the
 
               car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George 
               is such a
 
               great driver.

               
                             JERRY
               He is?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired 
               a gun right up in the air.
 
               
                             JERRY
               A gun?!

               
                             ELAINE
               I think it was a gun. And then they 
               followed us all the way into the
 
               city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they 
               went home.
 
               
                             JERRY
               My god, are you okay?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the 
               way, the car hit a pothole and now
 
               
               it's making a clanking noise.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, 
               that, that's the important thing.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Exactly.

               
                             JERRY
               Where's George now?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, he's out in front of the building. 
               He's arguing with some guy
 
               about a parking space.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you talking about?

               
                             ELAINE
               Look out the window, you'll see.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey Georgie!

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey!

               
                             JERRY
               Are you okay?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I'm fine.

               
                             JERRY
               Crazy kids, huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             ELAINE
               Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
 
               
               
                             MIKE
               Is that Jerry? Jerry?!

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, hey Mike.

               
               George What, you know Jerry?

               
                             MIKE
               Yeah, I know Jerry.

               
                             GEORGE
               How do you know him?

               
                             MIKE
               What's the difference?

               
                             GEORGE
               Because I know him too, and probably 
               a lot better than you.
 
               
                             MIKE
               Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You 
               know your friend here's a real
 
               piece of work!

               
                             JERRY
               I'm coming down.

               George, What, you know Kramer?!

               
               Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hi.

               wants to talk to you.

                             JERRY
               Yeah, he's a real phony.

               
                             KRAMER
               What's going on?!

                             GEORGE
               It's my space!

               
                             KRAMER
               I'll be down in a minute.

               
                             ELAINE
               Are you going down?

               
                             KRAMER

                             ELAINE
               Is anything wrong?

               
                             KRAMER
               Why should anything be wrong?

               
                             ELAINE
               Be down in a minute.

               
               Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.

               
                             MIKE
               Hey pal, you're not getting that space. 
               I mean, I'll sleep in my car if
 
               I have to.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'll die out here.

               
               Two bystanders are discussing the incident.

               
                             BYSTANDER #1
               He was down there. Once he passed his 
               front bumper, it's no
 
               longer his space.

               
                             BYSTANDER #2
               No, it doesn't matter. He was-

               
                             MIKE
               Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!

               
                             JERRY
               Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) 
               Indiana.
 
               
                             MIKE
               Hey Krame! You know this guy?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah, I know him.

               
                             MIKE
               You're looking tremendous. What are 
               you on some kind of
 
               regimen?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. 
               The forty percent was too much
 
               so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it 
               down another
 
               fifteen percent.

               
                             MIKE
               Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer!
 
               
               I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! 
               Ha ha ha!!!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, come on.

               
                             MIKE
               Hey! Your friend here has some real 
               problems.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Me? You see what he did here, you see 
               how he tried to sneak into my
 
               space?

               
                             MIKE
               Hey, just 'cause I went in front first 
               doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You only went in front first 'cause 
               you saw me backing up and you
 
               didn't have room to parallel park!

               
                             MIKE
               I only went in front first 'cause I 
               could make it in front first and if
 
               
               you pull out I'll show you!

               
                             GEORGE
               You've got a prayer.

               
                             KRAMER
               I go in front first all the time.

               
                             JERRY
               Front first, that's how you park when 
               you're pulling a bank job.
 
               
               Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.

               
                             GEORGE
               Did you talk to him?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, it's all taken care of.

               
                             GEORGE
               You told him? What did you tell him?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I did a number on him, it was a thing 
               of beauty, you really had to have
 
               
               been there to appreciate it.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't believe it, what did you say?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I told him a pack of teenagers in a 
               convertible were terrorizing us and
 
               
               they followed us into the city.

               
                             GEORGE
               A pack of teenagers?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, by the time I got to the end of 
               the story, he was to relieved
 
               that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.

               
                             GEORGE
               You are a genius, it's as simple as 
               that.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What can I say, you know? It's a gift. 
               I only wish I could teach it
 
               but, you know it's inborn.

               
               Elaine and George rejoin the others.

               
                             KRAMER
               By the way, thanks a lot for inviting 
               me to the flea market.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh great.

               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, so that's why you were acting so 
               funny.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well I didn't know you wanted to go 
               to the flea market.
 
               
                             MIKE
               A flea market? You went to a flea market??
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, who's talking to you?

               
                             ELAINE
               We just didn't think of you.

               
                             KRAMER
               You said it, sister.

               
                             GEORGE
               What? Every time I leave my house now 
               I have to call everybody I know
 
               and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?

               
               People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.

               
                             GEORGE
               Great move, telling him, by the way, 
               real smart move.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say 
               anything!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised 
               no judgement.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You're right. My fault.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I'm sorry.

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What was wrong with that sorry? It was 
               a good sorry. Jerry, was that
 
               a good sorry?

               
                             JERRY
               It was a so-so sorry.

               
               A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of 
               the cab.
 
               
                             TRUCK DRIVER
               Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You heard the man. I guess you gotta 
               be moving your car.
 
               
                             MIKE
               And like you're not gonna just back 
               it in if I do that?
 
               
                             TRUCK DRIVER
               Well somebody better move something 
               soon! I got a truck full of
 
               ice cream here!

               
               Fade out/in.

               
                             ELAINE
               You see, they had to move the cars so 
               the truck could get through,
 
               right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these 
               two nonpartisan
 
               drivers to move them.

               
                             JERRY
               Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Amazing how they picked you, out of 
               everyone, to terrorize.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why 
               us?' You remember?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Uh huh.

               
                             JERRY
               Sounds like you did some pretty nifty 
               maneuvering,
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well, you know, It's interesting, you 
               know, under that pressure, what
 
               you're capable of.

               
                             ELAINE
               Right.

               
                             GEORGE
               I learned a lot about myself.

               
                             JERRY
               What did you do to my car?!

               
                             GEORGE
               I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the 
               mirror, I got discombobulated.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I thought you said you were a good driver!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No no, I never said I was a good driver, 
               I said I was a good parker.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I think you said driver.

               
                             GEORGE
               Parker, I never said driver, I said 
               parker, a great parker.
 
               
                             MIKE
               Will you move it up a little bit?

               
                             GEORGE
               No no no, that's in the right position.
 
               
               
                             MIKE
               No no, I was further in.

               
                             GEORGE
               No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
 
               
               
                             MIKE
               Do you mind?

               
                             GEORGE
               Do you?

               
                             SID
               Hey, somebody better move these cars, 
               you're making a commotion.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey Sid.

               
                             MIKE
               Who are you?

               
                             SID
               Never mind who I am. I know who I am. 
               Do you know who you are? (to
 
               George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything 
               gets
 
               disrupted and disjointed?

               
                             GEORGE
               Sid, it's completely his fault.

               
                             MIKE
               Oh, right.

               
                             SID
               Why don't you start taking the bus?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm 
               putting it in a garage. The
 
               fight's starting in two minutes.

               
                             GEORGE
               Don't do it!

               
                             JERRY
               What are we gonna do, stay out here 
               all night?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, 
               it's my space.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Why don't you just flip a coin already?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No no, this is a matter of principle. 
               That would just be saying that
 
               anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. 
               Well I'm
 
               making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm 
               not putting up
 
               with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not 
               putting up with
 
               head first parking.

               
                             ELAINE
               You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting 
               there pontificating about
 
               what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               So you're against me now?

               
               An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' 
               frozen yogurt
 
               store, are discussing the incident.

               
                             ANGRY MAN
               He could have pulled up to the car and 
               backed in, but he chose to go
 
               in head first.

               
                             MATTHEW
               No he couldn't, because the other car 
               was already backing in.
 
               
                             ANGRY MAN
               No he wasn't.

               
                             MATTHEW
               All that matters is who was there first.
 
               
               
                             ANGRY MAN
               Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, 
               you little puke.
 
               
                             MATTHEW
               You just spit on me!

               
                             ANGRY MAN
               Don't you raise your voice to me!

               
                             MATTHEW
               You're not my father.

               Hey Matthew.

               
                             MATTHEW
               Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How ya doing?

               
                             MATTHEW
               Okay.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, how's your father? I hear he's 
               closing his store.
 
               
                             MATTHEW
               What?!

               
                             JERRY
               Oh no, nothing.

               
                             MATTHEW
               What's happened to daddy? He's going 
               out of business?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, no, no, no.

               
                             MATTHEW
               We're not going to have any money? We're 
               out of money?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, of course not, of course not!

               
                             MATTHEW
               Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the 
               store. He's going out of
 
               business. We don't have any money?

               
                             MARYEDITH
               Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't--

               
                             MARYEDITH
               Boy, I don't know about your friend, 
               Jerry. He says
 
               some pretty stupid things sometimes.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, congratulations.

               
                             MARYEDITH
               What for?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you're pregnant.

               
                             MARYEDITH
               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               You're not pregnant?

               
                             MARYEDITH
               No, I'm not pregnant.

               
                             KRAMER
               Are you sure you're not pregnant?

               
                             MARYEDITH
               Yes, I'm sure!

               
                             KRAMER
               That's weird.

               
                             MARYEDITH
               Come on, Matthew.

               
                             MATTHEW
               No.

               
                             MARYEDITH
               Come on, Matthew!

               
                             KRAMER
               I thought she was pregnant.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, do you think I'm phony?

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               Mike thinks I'm a phony.

               
                             ELAINE
               He thinks you're a phony?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, but I can't say anything because 
               Kramer wasn't supposed to tell
 
               me.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, you have to say something.

               
                             JERRY
               I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting 
               it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You gotta open the vault.

               
                             JERRY
               Open my vault?

               
                             ELAINE
               Open your vault.

               
                             JERRY
               Once I open the vault, it ceases to 
               be a vault.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You have no choice.

               
                             JERRY
               Oy ga-vault.

               
                             NEWMAN
               You wanna know why you can't go in front 
               first? I'll tell
 
               you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. 
               Chaos. It
 
               reduces us to jungle law.

               
               George begins applauding.

               
                             KRAMER
               When can you park head first?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Never.

               
                             MIKE
               What are you asking this guy for?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Who's talking to you?

               
                             GEORGE
               He's right. never.

               
                             MIKE
               Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? 
               You have to pull all the way
 
               up to the front car?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               When do you ever have ten car lengths?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What about Sundays and holidays?

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh please.

               
               A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George,

               
                             SHEILA
               What's going on here?

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my 
               space.
 
               
                             SHEILA
               I really hate people who do that. I 
               hope you don't let him get away
 
               with it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, thank you for your support.

               
                             SHEILA
               Hey, that's a great hat.

               
                             GEORGE
               Really? You like it? I got it at a flea 
               market today.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Hey George, nice hat.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, thanks.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Can I try it on?

               
                             GEORGE
               No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Well sure it would.

               
                             GEORGE
               No! Get out of here, Newman.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Come on, let me try it on.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, Newman, stop it.

               
                             SHEILA
               Let him try it on.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't want him to!

               
                             SHEILA
               What is wrong with you?

               
                             GEORGE
               You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat 
               to reveal the bald pate) There!
 
               There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try 
               on the hat?!
 
               Here! Try on the hat!

               
                             NEWMAN
               Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending 
               your parking.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, just keep the hat!

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, that's it. The fight's already 
               started. I'm going upstairs,
 
               who's coming? Elaine?

               
                             ELAINE
               It depends on who's going. (to George) 
               Are you going?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I'm not going if he's going.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Me either.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not going if he's going.

               
                             MIKE
               Well I'm going.

               
                             JERRY
               Well if he's going then I'm not going.
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               But it's your house.

               
                             JERRY
               I still don't have to go.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not 
               going.
 
               
                             MIKE
               Why won't you go if I go?

               
                             JERRY
               Why? I'll tell you why.

               
                             KRAMER
               No. Don't, Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               Like you didn't call me a phony?

               
                             MIKE
               What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! 
               Jerry! First of all, I think
 
               you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary 
               way. I
 
               mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's 
               good, sort of
 
               thing? You know, slang.

               
                             JERRY
               Use it in a sentence.

               
                             MIKE
               Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. 
               (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               He begged me.

               
                             MIKE
               He begged you?!

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, come on. Who wants to watch 
               the fight?
 
               
               Two police officers walk up.

               
                             COP #1
               Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 
               'em. Let's go.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Officer, could I just explain something 
               to you?
 
               
                             COP #1
               Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both 
               of you a ticket in about two
 
               minutes.

               
                             GEORGE
               Officer, he can't pull in head first.
 
               
               
                             MIKE
               Officer, he backed up from down the 
               street. He was double-parked, he was
 
               
               sitting there.

               
                             COP #1
               Alright, you move your car. It's his 
               space, you can't go in head
 
               first.

               
                             COP #2
               Wait a second. Why can't he go in head 
               first? He said the guy was
 
               just sitting over there.

               
                             COP #1
               What are you talking about? This guy 
               was here first.
 
               
                             COP #2
               But he didn't take it.

               
                             COP #1
               Hey, it's his space.

               
                             COP #2
               No, it's his space.

               
               Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard 
               arguing
 
               through the window.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, you're gonna have to go to the 
               bathroom!
 
               
                             MIKE
               Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't have a job!

               
                             MIKE
               Neither do I!

               
               Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the 
               remote and turns
 
               on the TV.

               
                             REFEREE
               Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*
 
               
               
               Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.

               People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because 
               they think,
 
               'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 
               'I'll be
 
               circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' 
               I think because
 
               everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars 
               than parking
 
               spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. 
               It's like
 
               Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem 
               is car
 
               manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars 
               every year, they're
 
               not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working 
               on. Wouldn't
 
               that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving 
               turntable,
 
               and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.

               I have never seen an old person in a 
               new bathing suit in my life. I don't 
               know where they get their bathing suits, 
               but my father has bathing suits from 
               other centuries. My parents live in 
               Florida, and if you go down there and 
               you forget your bathing suits then they 
               want you to wear one of theirs. You 
               know how that gets? "You need trunks 
               son? I've got trunks for you. You can 
               wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear 
               bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's 
               kind of the same thing a tree would 
               wear if it went swimming. So I get in 
               the water with in thing and it's like 
               floating around me somewhere. Did you 
               ever put on a bathing suit that you 
               don't even know exactly where you are 
               inside the bathing suit? You bump into 
               somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, 
               I'm waiting for the boat to come back."

               So, what took you so long?

               
                             JERRY
               We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car 
               place.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I don't know why you had to rent a car. 
               We would have picked you up.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What's the difference?

               
                             HELEN
               You could have used our car.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't wanna use your car.

               
                             HELEN
               What's wrong with our car?

               
                             JERRY
               Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you 
               wanna use it?
 
               
                             HELEN
               We don't use it.

               
                             MORTY
               What are you talking? We use it.

               
                             HELEN
               If you were using it, we wouldn't use 
               it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So what would you do? You'd hitch?
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               How much is a rent-a-car?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. 25 bucks a day.

               
                             HELEN
               What? You're crazy.

               
                             MORTY
               Plus the insurance.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

               
                             MORTY
               How could you not get the insurance?
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               We'll pay for the car.

               
                             JERRY
               You're not paying for it.

               
                             HELEN
               Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               God it's so hot in here. Why don't you 
               put on the air conditioning?
 
               
                             HELEN
               You don't need the air conditioner. 
               So, you have your speech all ready?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's not a speech. Do I have to make 
               a speech?
 
               
                             HELEN
               Of course, they're giving a testimonial 
               for your father. You could do your comic 
               routines.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over 
               real well with that crowd.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (looking by the window) Ooh, you have 
               a lake?
 
               
                             JERRY
               The lake isn't real.

               
                             HELEN
               The lake is real.

               
                             MORTY
               Are you kidding? They built the lake.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               But it's real. It's water.

               
               (Jerry and Elaine take their luggages to the guest room)

               
                             HELEN
               Where are you going with those?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               Don't sleep in there. You can you use 
               the bedroom.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I can't take your bedroom.

               
                             HELEN
               I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I can't kick you out of your bed.

               
                             HELEN
               We don't even sleep.

               
                             JERRY
               Ma.

               
                             HELEN
               But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               (to Morty) What about you?

               
                             MORTY
               Why should I be comfortable?

               
                             JERRY
               (to Helen) What about him?

               
                             HELEN
               Don't worry, he's comfortable.

               
                             MORTY
               I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
 
               
               
                             HELEN

                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes 
               in the guest room)
 
               
                             HELEN
               (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so 
               Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't 
               have to stay on the couch on my account. 
               The two of you could stay in there together.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               No that's not such a good idea.

               
                             HELEN
               Well I tought that...

               
                             JERRY
               Not now. She's right inside.

               
                             HELEN
               (quieter) What happened?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. We decided we don't really 
               work as a couple.
 
               
                             HELEN
               What does that mean?

               
                             JERRY
               Well...

               
                             MORTY
               (comes to the kitchen and with a loud 
               voice) Why are you whispering?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Shh! Nothing, nothing.

               
                             HELEN
               Elaine...

               
                             MORTY
               (still loud) What about her?

               
                             JERRY
               (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine 
               then comes out of the guest room to 
               get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) 
               ...but you know, look at the sun-dried 
               tomatoes. Where were they five years 
               ago? It just goes to show you. You never 
               know what... huh (waiting for Elaine 
               to go back in the guest room) you know... 
               huh... What could happen to a vegetable. 
               It could just take right off at any 
               time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry 
               goes on quieter) We've tried all kind 
               of arrangments, but we can't seem to 
               be friend when we sleep together.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper 
               in any episode? :-) Why do you need 
               more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               He's an idealist.

               
                             MORTY
               What the hell are you looking for?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I'm looking. That's the point. I like 
               looking.
 
               
                             HELEN
               He likes looking.

               
                             MORTY
               So look.

               
                             HELEN
               But how long can you look?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm going for the record.

               
               (Morty walks away with a face like he disagrees with Jerry)
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               You know your father wouldn't say so 
               but he's really glad you came.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, come on.

               
                             HELEN
               This is a big thing for him. Outgoing 
               president of the condo association.
 
               
               
                             
               this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               Aha!

               
                             DORIS
               So they arrived safely.

               
                             MORTY
               (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hi. Nice to meet you.

               
                             JACK
               So Jerry, you came all the way down 
               here for this?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               And scuba diving.

               
                             HELEN
               Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               We're going scuba diving. We'll be back 
               in time.
 
               
                             HELEN
               What do you have to go scuba diving 
               for?
 
               
                             JERRY
               For fun.

               
                             HELEN
               For fun?

               
                             MORTY
               Jack have some spong cake.

               
                             JACK
               No. thanks, no.

               
                             MORTY
               Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge 
               of the whole thing.
 
               
                             JACK
               So Jerry, your mother told me you're 
               gonna do one your little comedy skit 
               tommsorow?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't think so.

               
                             JACK
               No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up 
               for last night? (Morty nods) All right. 
               I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks 
               book and a pen from his pocket).
 
               
                             MORTY
               What did you have? You had the minute 
               steak?
 
               
                             JACK
               Yeah.

               
                             MORTY
               Did you have a coke or what?

               
                             JACK
               I did NOT have a coke.

               
                             MORTY
               Somebody had a coke.

               
                             HELEN
               Oh I had a coke.

               
                             DORIS
               And I had the scampi.

               
                             JACK
               So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the 
               tip.
 
               
                             MORTY
               All right. Make it 20 bucks.

               
                             JACK
               It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the 
               check)
 
               
                             MORTY
               19.45$ ?

               
                             JACK
               See? You know your father. He can't 
               get a write to the penny, but that's 
               why he was such a good president.
 
               
               
               (Jerry notices Klompus's pen)

               
                             JERRY
               What kind of pen is that?

               
                             JACK
               This pen?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             JACK
               This is an astronaut pen. It writes 
               upside down. They use this in space.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard 
               about that. Where did you get it?
 
               
               
                             JACK
               Oh it was a gift.

               
                             JERRY
               Cause sometimes I write in bed and I 
               have to turn and lean on my elbow to 
               make the pen works.
 
               
                             JACK
               Take the pen.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh no.

               
                             JACK
               Go ahead.

               
                             JERRY
               I couldn't

               
                             JACK
               Come on, take the pen!

               
                             JERRY
               I can't take it.

               
                             JACK
               Do me a personal favor!

               
                             JERRY
               No, I'm not...

               
                             JACK
               Take the pen!

               
                             JERRY
               I cannot take it!

               
                             JACK
               Take the pen!

               
                             JERRY
               Are you sure?

               
                             JACK
               Positive! Take the pen!

               
                             JERRY
               O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
               Gee, boy!
 
               
                             HELEN
               Jack, what are you doing?

               
                             JACK
               Stop it!

               
                             DORIS
               Jack, we should go. (they go to the 
               door) It was nice to meeting you.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Mmm, nice to meet you.

               
                             JERRY
               Thanks again.

               
                             JACK
               Come on!

               
                             DORIS
               (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               (as soon as the door's closed) What 
               did you take his pen for?
 
               
                             JERRY
               What he gave it to me.

               
                             HELEN
               You didn't have to take it.

               
                             MORTY
               Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal 
               out of everything.
 
               
                             JERRY
               He offered it to me.

               
                             HELEN
               Because you made such a big fuss about 
               it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I liked it. Should I have said I didn't 
               like it?
 
               
                             HELEN
               You shouldn't have said anything. What 
               did you expect him to do? (the camera 
               shows Elaine shaking her head at their 
               dispute)
 
               
                             JERRY
               He could have said: "Thank you, I like 
               it too" and put it back in his pocket.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               He loves that pen.

               
                             MORTY
               Oh come on!

               
                             HELEN
               He talks about it all the time. Every 
               time he takes it out he goes on and 
               on about how it writes upside down, 
               how the astronauts use it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               If he likes it so much, he never should 
               have offered it.
 
               
                             HELEN
               He didn't think you'd accpet.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, he was wrong.

               
                             HELEN
               I know his wife. She has some mouth 
               on her. She'll tell everyone in the 
               condo now that you made him give you 
               the pen. They're talking about it right 
               now. (againe we see Elaine smiling at 
               their argument)
 
               
                             JERRY
               So you want me to return it?

               
                             HELEN
               Yes.

               
                             MORTY
               He's not gonna return the pen. That's 
               ridiculous.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey I don't even want the pen now!
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               Jack can afford to give away a pen with 
               all his money. Believe me. He gives 
               me a check for 19.45. He didn't have 
               a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad 
               to try the pen) Hey, it wrtites upside 
               down.
 
               
               (scene ends)

               
               
               
               
               
               (condo's guest room)

               
               (Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall 
               asleep)
 
               
               (knock on door)

               
                             ELAINE
               Come in.

               
                             JERRY
               Are you O.K. in here?

               
                             ELAINE
               Why is it so hot in here? How can they 
               sleep like this?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's only for three days. Today's over 
               and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. 
               It's one day, really.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh man. What is with this bar? It's 
               right in my back. It's killing me.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on 
               a love seat. I've got my feet up in 
               the air like I'm in a space capsule.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I am never gonna fall asleep.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               How can they not put the air conditioning 
               on?
 
               
                             JERRY
               They're nuts with temperature.

               
                             ELAINE
               This bar is right in my back! It's making 
               a dent.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How about that guy writing a check for 
               19.45?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's one day. Half a day, really. I 
               mean you substract showers and meals, 
               it's like twenty minutes. It will go 
               by like that. (snapping his fingers)
 
               
               
               (scene ends)

               
               
               
               
               
               (condo, morning)

               
               (Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. 
               Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. 
               Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker 
               on immediatly, there's an abutment there. 
               Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, 
               but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off 
               Biscayne. You understand me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Stay on Biscayne.

               
                             HELEN
               You're going underwater?

               
                             JERRY
               Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving 
               is done.
 
               
                             HELEN
               What do you have to go underwater for? 
               What's down there that's so special?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What's so special up here?

               
               (Elaine open the guest room's door and she's in pain)

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh!

               
               (everybody get up and walk to her)

               
                             HELEN
               What's the matter?

               
                             ELAINE
               My back.

               
                             HELEN
               What happened?

               
                             ELAINE
               That... That bed. The bar was right 
               in my back.
 
               
                             HELEN
               (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep 
               in there.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Then YOU would be hunched over.

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't even know if I can go scuba 
               diving.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You can't go?

               
                             HELEN
               So stay home.

               
                             ELAINE
               You can go.

               
                             JERRY
               Without you? That's the whole reason 
               you came down here.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Don't go.

               
                             JERRY
               You sure?

               
                             MORTY
               Maybe you should see a doctor.

               
                             JERRY
               We'll stay in a hotel tonight.

               
                             ELAINE
               (whispering to Jerry) Yes!

               
                             HELEN
               No, we'll stay in there.

               
                             JERRY
               Why don't you get a new sofa?

               
                             MORTY
               Nobody uses it.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm buying you a new sofa.

               
                             HELEN
               Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.

               
                             ELAINE
               Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. 
               Put the air conditioner on.
 
               
                             HELEN
               You're hot?

               
                             ELAINE
               I've lost 6 pounds.

               
                             HELEN
               I don't even know how to work it.

               
                             MORTY
               I keep telling her it's like an oven 
               in here.
 
               
               (Evelyn, a neighboor, enters)

               
                             EVELYN
               Is everybody up?

               
                             JERRY
               Hi. How are you?

               
                             EVELYN
               Hello Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               Evelyn, this is Elaine.

               
                             ELAINE
               (with pain) Hi Evelyn.

               
                             EVELYN
               Jerry you got thin.

               
                             JERRY
               Too thin?

               
                             HELEN
               Oh stop worrying so much about how you 
               look.
 
               
                             EVELYN
               So where's the new pen? (everybody's 
               surprised by this question)
 
               
                             JERRY
               (Jerry scratches his head and acts like 
               he's not sure what she's talking about) 
               What?
 
               
                             EVELYN
               The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               How did you know that?

               
                             EVELYN
               Blanche told me.

               
                             HELEN
               Blanche?

               
                             EVELYN
               That's some good pen. It writes upside 
               down.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               The astronauts use them.

               
                             HELEN
               What did Blanche say?

               
                             EVELYN
               I don't know. She said Jerry wanted 
               the pen.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I never really wanted the pen.

               
                             MORTY
               He gave him the pen.

               
                             HELEN
               Morty.

               
                             EVELYN
               Why you don't like the pen?

               
                             JERRY
               No, no, I...

               
                             EVELYN
               Cause if you don't like it, give it 
               back to him.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Is that what she said?

               
                             EVELYN
               Who?

               
                             HELEN
               Blanche.

               
                             EVELYN
               What are you talking about?

               
               (The phone rings, Helen answers.)

               
                             HELEN
               Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't 
               do that. Jack gave it to him. All he 
               said was he liked it. I mean nobody 
               put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're 
               giving him back that pen. (She continues 
               the discussion with Gussy but we don't 
               hear it.)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about 
               it.
 
               
               (the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.)

               
                             JERRY
               All I said was "I like the pen".

               
               (Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner)

               
                             MORTY
               How the hell do you work this thing?
 
               
               
               (scene ends)

               
               
               
               
               
               (still the condo, later)

               
               (Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with 
               pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking 
               at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)
 
               
                             HELEN
               Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

               
                             ELAINE
               No no, I wanna go.

               
                             HELEN
               But your back hurts.

               
                             MORTY
               Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would 
               help.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater 
               tight against herself) You can turn 
               down the air conditioning if you want.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               No. I'm fine.

               
                             ELAINE
               You're not too cold?

               
                             HELEN
               No.

               
               (Jerry enters with a black eye)

               
                             JERRY
               Don't be alarmed.

               
                             MORTY
               Oh my God! What the hell happened to 
               you?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.

               
                             HELEN
               Your capillaries? Do you know what you 
               look like?
 
               
                             JERRY
               (to Elaine on the floor) How are you 
               doing?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Having a good time!

               
                             JERRY
               Is it my imagination or is it freezing 
               in here?
 
               
                             HELEN
               What happened to your eyes?

               
                             JERRY
               Well I started to go under...

               
                             HELEN
               With the instructor?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, and I got about ten feet down 
               and I felt this tremendous pressure 
               on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being 
               sucked out of their sockets.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I told you...

               
               (Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar)

               
                             JACK
               Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like 
               to borrow red your pocketbook to go 
               with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) 
               The shoes have to match the pocketbook. 
               (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               My back hurts.

               
                             JACK
               Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               We got plenty of time.

               
                             JACK
               (to Jerry) What happened to you?

               
                             JERRY
               I got in a fist fight with one of the 
               ladies at the pool.
 
               
                             HELEN
               It's from scuba diving.

               
                             JACK
               What's there to see underwater?

               
                             
               give him back the pen)

               
                             JERRY
               Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice 
               gesture of you to give me the pen, but 
               I don't really need it.
 
               
                             JACK
               You what?

               
                             JERRY
               I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think 
               you should keep it. (he tends the pen 
               to Jack)
 
               
                             JACK
               Well I mean...

               
                             JERRY
               Take it.

               
                             JACK
               All right! (he smiles and take it)
 
               
               
               (Morty gets up and walks right to Jack)

               
                             MORTY
               You know Jack, you've got a hell of 
               a nerve taking that kid's pen.
 
               
                             JACK
               Whose pen?

               
                             MORTY
               His pen.

               
                             JACK
               This happens to be my pen.

               
                             MORTY
               You didn't give it to him.

               
                             JACK
               What are you talking about? He pratically 
               begged me for it.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Where do you come off with this crap?
 
               
               
                             JACK
               Listen, do you think I take everything 
               everybody offers me? You offered me 
               sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               You said you didn't want it!

               
                             JACK
               Of course I wanted it! I love sponge 
               cake!
 
               
                             MORTY
               Then who the hell said you couldn't 
               have any? I mean what the hell do I 
               care whether you have sponge cake?
 
               
               
               (Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing)

               
                             JACK
               Because I saw the look on your face 
               last week when I took the scotch tape!
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! 
               I've been looking all over for it!
 
               
               
                             JACK
               Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               I don't want it!

               
                             JACK
               I don't want it!

               
                             MORTY
               You know Jack, do me a favor will you? 
               Take the pen and the scotch tape, and 
               get the hell out of here!
 
               
                             JACK
               Listen do you think I give a damn?
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that 
               guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it 
               for them.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What is going on in this community! 
               Are you people aware of what's happening? 
               What is driving you to this behavior? 
               Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? 
               Is it the white shoes?
 
               
                             HELEN
               I have no use for either one of them. 
               I don't even want them there tonight. 
               (she still has the pocketbook in her 
               hands)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well. This should be a very interesting 
               evening.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (still on the floor) Uh... What about 
               those muscle relaxers?
 
               
               (scene ends)

               
               
               
               
               
               (reception room, evening)

               
               (Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph 
               in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up 
               on muscle relaxers.)
 
               
                             PHOTOGRAPHER
               Say astronaut.

               
               (Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the 
               lens of the camera.)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Say what? (laughing) Say what?

               
                             JERRY
               (Jerry brings her back) You took too 
               many of those pills.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Astronaut?

               
                             HELEN
               Say it.

               
               
                             ELAINE
               (still laughing, she says it just as 
               the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
 
               
               
               (the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with 
               Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely 
               stand.)
 
               
                             MORTY
               Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) 
               What about last year when I took him 
               to the hospital every day? Did he ever 
               say thank you?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing 
               as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his 
               wife Stella)
 
               
                             JERRY
               (to Leo) Uncle Leo.

               
                             LEO
               Hello!

               
                             STELLA
               Morty are you nervous?

               
                             MORTY
               What nervous?

               
                             LEO
               (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm 
               as usual) What's with the sunglasses? 
               Who are you? Van Johnson?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I've got a black eye.

               
                             STELLA
               (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.

               
                             HELEN
               (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) 
               STELLA! STELLA!
 
               
                             JERRY
               (to Stella) Her back hurts.

               
                             STELLA
               Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" 
               last week.
 
               
                             LEO
               I thought Johnny was very rude to you. 
               He didn't even let you talk.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, no.

               
                             LEO
               You need some new material. I've heard 
               you do that dog routine three times 
               already.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (still with her imitation, shouting 
               even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
 
               
                             LEO
               Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey 
               to write some material for you.
 
               
                             MORTY
               What are you talking? Jeffrey works 
               for the parks department!
 
               
                             LEO
               You should read the letters he's written. 
               He's funnier than the whole bunch of 
               you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's 
               Jack. We should sit down.
 
               
               (Jack and Morty exchange a look.)

               
                             STELLA
               (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) 
               This better be good. I'm missing "Golden 
               Girls" for this.
 
               
                             HELEN
               (laughing hypocritically till Stella 
               walks away) I hate her like poison.
 
               
               
                             
               "Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause 
               and we see, from left to right, all 
               sitting on the same side of a long table, 
               facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, 
               Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, 
               Doris, and four other people.)
 
               
                             JACK
               (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, 
               as you know, every year, Phase Two of 
               the Pines of Mark Gables honors the 
               previous year president. And this year 
               we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the 
               crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) 
               A man who slept more hours on the job 
               than Ronald Reagan.
 
               
                             MORTY
               (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed 
               him)
 
               
                             JACK
               Being president of the condo is not 
               easy. It requires hard work, dedication, 
               and commitment, and unfortunately he 
               possesses none of these qualities. (everyone 
               laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. 
               Even Elaine who's still druggy)
 
               
                             HELEN
               (Morty complains again to Helen) He's 
               joking.
 
               
                             JACK
               His administration did excel in one 
               department: the hiring of incompetents.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
 
               
               
                             JACK
               But we do owe him a debt of gratitude 
               because by not fixing the crack in the 
               sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission 
               for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only 
               one not laughing)
 
               
                             MORTY
               (loud) Tell them when you took my son's 
               pen back. Tell them about that! (he 
               gets up)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Dad!

               
                             MORTY
               (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, 
               and then he takes it back. Tell them 
               about that!
 
               
                             JACK
               He gave it to me!

               
                             MORTY
               Come on. That's enough, sit down!

               
                             JACK
               I'm not sitting down!

               
               (they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' 
               hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and 
               tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone 
               and they stop to fight)
 
               
                             JACK
               Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack 
               is touching his dental plate while Morty 
               reaches in Jack's pocket to get the 
               pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. 
               You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. 
               (he leaves the table and Morty follows 
               him and continue arguing with him. Jerry 
               now have the microphone in his hands 
               and the crowd begins to think the ceremony 
               is over.)
 
               
                             HELEN
               Jerry, do your act.

               
                             JERRY
               (in the microphone, but to Helen) I 
               can't. Nobody's even listening.
 
               
                             HELEN
               They're all gonna leave.

               
                             JERRY
               (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) 
               huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? 
               (everybody in the crowd is talking over 
               Jerry)
 
               
                             MAN IN THE CROWD
               Who are you?

               
                             JERRY
               (still with his sunglasses) Have you 
               ever noticed how they always give you 
               the peanuts on the planes?
 
               
                             WOMAN IN THE CROWD
               (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies 
               first class.
 
               
               (Elaine is almost asleep at the table)

               
                             JERRY
               Who ever thought the first thing somebody 
               wants on a plane is a peanut?
 
               
                             MAN IN THE CROWD
               I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               (to Jerry) Do the dog routine.

               
                             JERRY
               All I said was I liked the pen!

               
                             ELAINE
               (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!

               Jerry's sitting next to her. Helen is standing beside them and 
               Morty is still asleep in the guest room)

               You could aggravated. I wouldn't go 
               anywhere for at least five days.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Five days? You want me to stay here 
               for five more days?
 
               
                             JERRY
               There must be some mistake.

               
                             CHIROPRACTOR
               I'm afraid not.

               
                             ELAINE
               (discouraged) Five days. Here.

               
                             HELEN
               (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for 
               five more days!
 
               
                             JERRY

                             JERRY
               Nothing.

                             EVELYN
               Good morning.

               
                             JERRY
               Hi Evelyn.

               
                             EVELYN
               (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer 
               yet?
 
               
                             HELEN
               I don't think so.

               
                             EVELYN
               Because my nephew Larry could do it. 
               He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack 
               has no case.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I'll ask him when he gets up.

               
                             EVELYN
               Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says 
               that according to the bylaws of the 
               condo constitution, they need six votes 
               to throw you out for unruly behavior. 
               Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one 
               you'll have to suck up to.
 
               
               (Morty gets up in a bad shape)

               
                             MORTY
               Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's 
               that bar. Who the hell could sleep on 
               that thing?
 
               
                             HELEN
               I was very comfortable.

               
                             EVELYN
               Morty, Arnold says they need six votes 
               to throw you out.
 
               
                             HELEN
               It's in the constitution.

               
                             MORTY
               (to the chiro) Who are you?

               
                             CHIROPRACTOR
               I'm a chiropractor.

               
                             MORTY
               What are you kidding me?

               
                             ELAINE
               (to Jerry) Five more days?

               
                             JERRY
               Well today's almost over. And weekdays 
               always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. 
               It's like two days really. It's like 
               a cup of coffee. It will go by like 
               that. (snapping his fingers)
 
               
               (scene ends)

                              THE END

                             JERRY
               Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I was telling you about Noel.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (sarcastically) Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly 
               funny...
 
               
                             JERRY
               All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What, you think I'm going to repeat 
               the whole thing now?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I know, you told me you like her, everything 
               is going good.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No everything is not going good. I'm 
               very uncomfortable. I have
 
               
               no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. Once in
 
               
               
               my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand 
               at
 
               
               all. She has the hand; I have no hand...

               
                             GEORGE
               How do I get the hand?

               
                             JERRY
               We all want the hand. Hand is tough 
               to get. You gotta get the
 
               
               hand right from the opening.

               
                             GEORGE
               She's playing a recital this week at 
               the McBierney School. You wanna hear 
               her play? I got two extra tickets, you 
               and Elaine could go...
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Then afterwards maybe we could all go 
               out together. Y'know she'll
 
               
               see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as 
               myself.
 
               
               Maybe I can get some hand that way.

                             KRAMER
               Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!

               
                             GEORGE
               With all due respect, I don't think 
               so...
 
               
                             JERRY
               That smells good, what is that?

               
                             KRAMER
               The beach!

               
                             JERRY
               The beach?

               
                             GEORGE
               What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees 
               out!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You joined the Polar Bears?!

               
                             GEORGE
               What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' 
               in the winter. They're terrific, I just 
               took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! 
               It's invigorating....
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah... So's shock therapy.

               
                             JERRY
               (with glee) What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at 
               the Flea Market.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

               
                             JERRY
               You don't know?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, I-I-I know... (retreats back to 
               his Chinese take out) I know...
 
               
                             JERRY
               You think they have fleas there, don't 
               you?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No...

               
                             JERRY
               Yes you do, Biff. You've never been 
               to a Flea Market, and you
 
               
               think they have fleas there.

               
                             GEORGE
               All right, I think they have fleas there. 
               So what...
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I don't know how anyone does this. It 
               must be so nerve racking...
 
               
               How do they warm up their fingers?

               
                             JERRY
               They have a piano backstage they warm 
               up on.
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               No, we would have heard it.

               
                             JERRY
               What, do you think they just crack their 
               knuckles and come out?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I told her we'd all go out afterwards, 
               okay? And don't applaud
 
               
               when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.

               
                             JERRY
               (quickly whispering) I resent that you 
               said that! That's
 
               
               directed at me, isn't it?!

               
               A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.

               
                             JERRY
               Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             STEVE
               Something I said? (no response) It's 
               John... Mollika.
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               Oh, oh, John... Oh, hi John... Hi...
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               What're you doing down here?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry 
               put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I
 
               
               
               started laughing.

               
                             MOLLIKA
               Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke 
               up.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               We did. We're just hanging out.

               
                             MOLLIKA
               REally. ... You really look great.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends 
               with Richie Appel?
 
               
                             MOLLIKA
               Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in 
               L. A. for a few years. He
 
               
               just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs.
 
               
               
               I don't know what to do for the guy.

               
                             ELAINE
               Have you thought about an intervention?
 
               
               
                             MOLLIKA
               What's that?

               
                             ELAINE
               You get all his friends in a room, They 
               confront himm to try to get
 
               
               him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.

               
                             MOLLIKA
               He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except 
               of course Jerry. He'd listen to
 
               
               Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
 
               
               
               Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.

               
               Outside Noel's dressing room

               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!

               
                             GEORGE
               What did you put the Pez dispenser on 
               her leg for in the first
 
               
               place?

               
                             JERRY
               I dunno, it was an impulse.

               
                             GEORGE
               What kind of a sick impulse does that??
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How could I know she would start to 
               laugh?
 
               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am!

               
                             JERRY
               Can we just go in already?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are we gonna tell her?

               
                             ELAINELAINE
               I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, don't say a word. If she thinks 
               my friends are jerks, then
 
               
               I'm a jerk...

               
                             ELAINELAINE
               (To Jerry) Oh, remind me to talk to 
               you about something later.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What about?

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I know, but I'm distracted now.

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you? A baby!? All right. Tell 
               her.
 
               
               E When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.

               
                             JERRY
               Really John Mollika, they guy that used 
               to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's 
               he doing?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               He's good.

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, can we cut to the chase?

               
                             JERRY
               "Cut to the chase"?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah...

               
                             JERRY
               What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?

               
                             GEORGE
               A lot of people say it.

               
                             JERRY
               I would lose that.

               
                             GEORGE
               (Accusingly) What's that?

               
                             JERRY
               "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood

               (Realizing full well it isn't) ...Yes 
               it is.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Anyway ... So John told me that Richie 
               is in town from
 
               
               Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told

               
               him that he should do an intervention.

               
                             JERRY
               Really, an intervention ...

               
                             GEORGE
               Y'know people, we got a situation over 
               here!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, but he want's you to be a part 
               of it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Me? Why me?

               
                             ELAINE
               'Cause Richie really respects you and 
               he would listen to you.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Y'know these things are really hard 
               to load...
 
               
                             GEORGE
               All right, OK, I'm goin' in.

               
                             JERRY
               We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               All right.

               
               (They Enter)

               
                             GEORGE
               Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.

               
                             NOEL
               No..

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and 
               Jerry, ... Noel
 
               
                             JERRY
               You play a Hell of a piano.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I was really moved, really moved.
 
               
               
                             NOEL
               Well didn't you hear that person laughing? 
               I couldn't play. I was
 
               
               humiliated...

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you.

               
                             NOEL
               Well then, what was she laughing at?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Pez?

               
                             NOEL
               Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Me, uh, uh, no, ...

               
                             JERRY
               Anyone who would laugh at a recital 
               is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. 
               I mean only a sick twisted mind could 
               be that rude and ignorant.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe some mental defective put something 
               stupid on her leg.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Even if this so called mental defective 
               did put something on her leg she's still 
               the one who laughed.
 
               
                             NOEL
               I'll never forget that laugh for the 
               rest of my life. (exits)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sure she would apologize if she 
               could. Probably somebody is holding 
               her back against every fibre in her 
               being.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               If she want's to continue to have a 
               fibre of her being she'll be very careful 
               (hitting each other)
 
               
               (Noel enters)

               
                             GEORGE
               All right, so are you ready, so we'll 
               go out and get something to eat.
 
               
                             NOEL
               I don't feel like it tonight.

               
                             JERRY
               We'll be outside

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah

               
                             JERRY
               It was nice meeting you By the way, 
               How do you warm up your fingers before 
               you play?
 
               
                             N
               I just crack my knuckles.

                             N

                             GEORGE
               Ah, come on

               
                             N
               I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!

               Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. 
               I'll call you and we'll talk on the 
               phone. A telephone communiqué. Every

                             JERRY
               You know I thing Kramer might have been 
               responsible for getting Richie involved 
               with drugs in the first place.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What? How?

               
                             JERRY
               A few years ago the comedy club had 
               a softball team. Kramer was our first 
               baseman You couldn't get anything by 
               him It was unbelievable.
 
               
               Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. 
               So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade 
               on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead 
               and does it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               So? What happened?

               
                             JERRY
               What happened? The guy was like 67 years 
               old, it was freezing out, he caught 
               a cold, got pneumonia,
 
               
               and a month later he was dead.

               
                             ELAINE
               Shut up!

               
                             JERRY
               All the comedians were happy. He was 
               one of these club owners nobodu liked 
               anyway. But Richie was never the same.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Whar about Kramer?

               
                             JERRY

               Are you sure you want me John. I have 
               spoken to Richie in two years. I don't 
               have a good apartment for
 
               
               an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. 
               All right All right. Goodbye.
 
               
               (to Kramer) Remember Ricie Appel?

               
                             KRAMER
               (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told 
               to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty 
               Benson?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing 
               some kind of intervention for him. We're 
               having it here.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Can I get in on that?

               
                             JERRY
               What do you think? It's like a poker 
               game?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Is Elaine going?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, I knew him as well as she did.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, but John invited her.

               
                             KRAMER
               So what are you saying, you don't want 
               me to intervene?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, intervene, go intervene all you 
               want. I am just afraid you might be 
               interfering while we're intervening.

                             KRAMER
               You know I got a great idea for a cologne. 
               The Beach. You spray it on and you smell 
               like you just
 
               
               came home from the beach

               
                             JERRY
               Hum, a cologne that smells like the 
               beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, 
               "That's not a bad idea."
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Tell me about it!

               Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he 
               works in the marketing department at 
               Calvin Klein.
 
               
               In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.

                             JERRY
               She broke up with you?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, but I can tell she's going to. I 
               can sense it. We had this terrible phone 
               conversation.
 
               
               I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of 
               things to talk about.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What was on the list?

               Let's see, How I'm very good at going 
               in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum 
               a more popular drink,
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,

               
                             GEORGE
               Anyway there was all this tension. I 
               asked her if she wanted to go out to 
               dinner and she said
 
               
               "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that 
               means.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What's wrong with lunch?

               
                             GEORGE
               Lunch is fine at the beginning then 
               you move on to dinner. you don't move 
               back to lunch. It's like being demoted.
 
               
               
               I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know 
               it.

                             KRAMER
               You break up with her. You reverse everything 
               that way.

                             GEORGE
               A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible 
               idea. I got nothing to lose.
 
               
               We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go 
               out with some
 
               
               Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.

                             GEORGE
               Never expected this did you?

               
                             NOEL
               I thought everything was fine.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, live and learn.

               
                             NOEL
               I don't understand. You're breaking 
               up with me. Didn't we have fun doing 
               the crossword puzzles?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Kind of.

               
                             NOEL
               I'm very confused.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
 
               
               
                             NOEL
               I thought,...

               
                             GEORGE
               Now, stop it ...

               When you're playing the piano do you

               I don't know.

               
                             GEORGE
               This is what I'm talking about.

               
                             NOEL
               OK, I'll think about you.

               You know the way you smell when you 
               first come home from the beach?
 
               
               Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that 
               smell.
 
               
               Oh yeah.

               That is the dumbest idea I have ever

                             STEVE
               Do you think people are going to pay 
               $80 a bottle to smell like dead
 
               
               fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come
 
               
               
               home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.

               You're getting warm.

               
               George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful)

               
                             GEORGE
               We just came from Chadway's(?) What's 
               going on.
 
               
                             JERRY
               We're having the intervention for Richie.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, right, right, the intervention. 
               Should we leave?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, uh..

               
                             NOEL
               (happily) Elaine, hi.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, hi Noel

               
               (Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them)

               
                             JERRY
               Well, you're looking well.

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry, let me tell you something, "A 
               man without hand is not a man."
 
               
               I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank 
               Kramer.
 
               
                             STEVE
               Even if I were dragged through manure 
               I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               You think so?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't think so I know so, Kramer, 
               come here I got to talk to you
 
               
                             OLD MAN
               The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch 
               only the female has it. The male has 
               pouch envy.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (Chuckles)

               
               Old GUY; at least give me a pocket.

               
                             ELAINE
               (laughs)

               
               Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven

               
                             NOEL
               That laugh. That's the laugh. That's 
               it. You're the one.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No, no. It was an accident. It really 
               wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
 
               
               Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg.

               
                             NOEL
               You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during 
               my recital?.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know she would laugh.

               
                             NOEL
               You lied to me George, you lied to me.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? 
               ... Where are you going?
 
               
                             NOEL
               I ... am breaking up ... with you!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You can't break up with me. I've got 
               hand.
 
               
                             NOEL
               And you're going to need it.

               
               Noel exits, George chases her

               
               Richie and John enter

               
                             JERRY
               Hey Richie

               
                             RICHIE
               So what's going on?

               
               Later

               
                             JERRY
               It was pretty ugly from the get go. 
               he's not listening, He's hostile, he's
 
               
               
               talking back.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't do these puzzles.

               
                             JERRY
               So he starts to get up He spots the 
               Pez dispenser on the coffee table
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Ah ah Pez dispenser.

               
                             JERRY
               He picks it up - he stares at it - It's 
               like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's
 
               
               
               telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the 
               car with his father, and
 
               
               his father was trying to load one of them

               
                             GEORGE
               Well they're hard to load.

               
                             JERRY
               Tell me something I don't know. So as 
               the father's trying to load it he loses 
               control
 
               
               of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's 
               hurt but Pez is all
 
               
               over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond 
               recognition.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Poor kid.

               
                             JERRY
               So as he's telling the story he starts 
               crying.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What did you do?

               
                             JERRY
               What do you think? I gave him my Pez 
               dispenser.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wow

               
                             JERRY
               Two hours later he checks into Smither's 
               clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.
 
               
               
               He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating 
               them like there's no tomorrow.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What's a three letter word for candy?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I can't do those things.

               
               
               
               
                            THE END

               I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit 
               of a scary place to work. I don't know 
               how you feel about it. You want to be 
               standing there having people comming 
               in all day going "I need knives. I need 
               more knives. Do you have any bigger 
               knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, 
               long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in 
               the market for. I like them really sharp. 
               Do you have one with hooks and gouges 
               like blades and kind of serrated? That's 
               the kind of knife I'm looking for. I 
               need one I can throw. I need another 
               one I can just hack away with. Do you 
               have anything like that?

                             JERRY
               Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking 
               about.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Like you do.

               
                             JERRY
               Well what do you think? They put the 
               statue on a giant raft and a tugboat 
               pulled it all the way from France?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What do you think? The brought it over 
               in pieces and screwed it together like 
               a coffee table?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas 
               party isn't it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why did France give that to us anyway?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It was a gift.

               
                             GEORGE
               So countries just exchange gifts like 
               that?
 
               
                             JERRY
               If they like each other.

               
                             GEORGE
               There's Elaine.

               
                             JERRY
               See that guy he's talking with? That's 
               her new boyfriend.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Really? They work here in the office?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. They're having a little fling 
               so don't say anything.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like 
               I've got nothing better to talk about.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Really?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two 
               years.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               "Off the wagon"?

               
                             JERRY
               I think it's off the wagon.

               
                             GEORGE
               I think it's "on the wagon".

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding 
               out a present)
 
               
                             ELAINE

                             JERRY
               Hey keep your hands to yourself if you 
               know what's good for you.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Where did you find it?

               
                             JERRY
               Under the sofa cushion.

               
                             ELAINE
               And you stopped by just to give it to 
               me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's your Christmas present.

               
                             ELAINE
               I though I'd never find it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well today's your lucky day.

               
                             ELAINE
               No. Today's *your* lucky day.

               
                             GEORGE
               It will be my first one.

               
                             ELAINE
               You want to work here?

               Huh?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah one of the readers left and there's 
               a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and 
               this is George.
 
               
                             DICK
               Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               "The guy?"

               
                             ELAINE
               (softly to Dick) Dick.

               
                             GEORGE
               How can you just get it?

               
                             ELAINE
               My boss told me to find someone. I'm 
               in charge of it. All you have to do 
               is meet him. Come on. Come on, come 
               on, here hold my drink.

               Cranberry juice?

               
                             ELAINE
               And vodka.

               
                             DICK
               I got the cranberry juice.

               
                             DICK
               So... you're Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)

               So have you ever done this kind of work 
               before?

               of stuff.

               He's a sports writer for the daily news. 
               I find him very insightful...
 
               
                             BOSS
               No, no, no. I mean authors.

               
                             GEORGE
               Lot of good ones. I don't even want 
               to mention anyone because I'm afraid 
               I'm going to leave somebody out.

               (picking up the drink) I've got new 
               for you. I'm funnier than you are.

               Where's my drink?

               
                             JERRY
               There. (turns to George) So, how did 
               it go?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I think he was impressed.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up 
               yours.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. 
               I told you to hold it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I 
               thought you meant hold it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               One drink like that and he could fall 
               right off the wagon.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Told you.

               I never feel comfortable in the women's 
               department. I feel like I'm just a *little* 
               too close to trying on a dress.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Do I really have to buy her something?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Hey the woman got you a job. The least 
               you could do is buy her a gift. How 
               about this?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What is that? Is that cashmere?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah. She would love cashmere.

               
                             GEORGE
               Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one 
               person in the world that doesn't like 
               cashmere. It's too expensive.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked 
               down from 600.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wow. Excuse me, Miss?

               
                             WOMAN
               Yes?

               
                             GEORGE
               How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
 
               
               
                             WOMAN

               why.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What? I don't see anything.

               
                             WOMAN
               See this red dot?

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's 
               not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
 
               
               
                             WOMAN
               There's no exchanges on this.

               
                             GEORGE
               You think she would care about the red 
               dot?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's hard to say.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't even think she'd notice it. 
               Can you see it?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well I can see it.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, but you know where it is.

               
                             JERRY
               Well what do you want me to do? Not 
               look at it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Pretend you didn't know it was there. 
               Can you see it?
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's hard to pretend because I know 
               where it is.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well just take an overview. Can't you 
               just take an overview?
 
               
                             JERRY
               You want me to take an overview?

               
                             GEORGE
               Please.

               
                             JERRY
               I see a very cheap man holding a sweater 
               trying to get away with something. That's 
               my overview.
 
               
               At Jerry's apartment.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah so?

               
                             ELAINE
               He's acting very strangely. I think 
               he started drinking again.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh boy, can you smell it?

               
                             ELAINE
               No. I can't smell it.

               
                             JERRY
               Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't 
               been drinking.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You don't always smell someone from 
               a drink.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yes you do.

               
                             ELAINE
               What about one drink? Would you smell 
               it from one drink?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yes you would.

               
               Kramer enters

               
                             JERRY
               I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Okay.

               
                             JERRY
               Would you take a drink and let us smell 
               you?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You can smell me without the drink.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might 
               be drinking but I can't smell it.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Okay, well what am I drinking? What 
               do you got?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave 
               me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for 
               two years. I've been using it as a paint 
               thinner.

                             KRAMER
               All right.

               
               Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't smell anything.

               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
 
               
               
               Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               (over the speaker) It's George.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             KRAMER
               That is *damn* good scotch. I could 
               do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, 
               boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. 
               And afterwords you don't even smell. 
               That's right folks. I just had three 
               shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. 
               Imagine, you can walk around drunk all 
               day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell,

                             GEORGE
               Hello everybody.

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey. (snuggling really close to George) 
               I'm going to tell you what I think. 
               I know you don't care what I think, 
               but I'm going to tell you. I think that 
               you are terrific.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (uncomfortablly) Thank you.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey what's that?

               
                             GEORGE
               It's an early Christmas present.

               
                             ELAINE
               Christmas present? For who?

               
                             GEORGE
               For you.

               
                             ELAINE
               *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Say you got a big job interview, and 
               you're a little nervous. Well throw 
               back a couple shots of Hennigans and 
               you'll be as loose as a goose and ready 
               to roll in no time. And because it's 
               odorless, why, it will be our little 
               secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Kramer. Yeah that'll do.

               
                             ELAINE
               (opening the present) Oh George, this 
               is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it's cashmere.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I love cashmere.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well who doesn't.

               
                             ELAINE
               My, George this must have cost a fortune.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Ahh, money.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, how could you let him spend so 
               much money?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He 
               just wants to make people happy.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               George, this is one of the nicest things 
               anyone has ever given me.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well good, good. Take it off you're 
               going to wear it out already. It's for 
               special occasions this thing.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What's that red dot on your sweater?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               Just take it off. I'm getting hot just 
               looking at it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.

               
                             GEORGE
               What red dot? What are you talking about? 
               Jerry come here for a second. Do you 
               see anything here?
 
               
                             JERRY
               (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, 
               I don't know.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What don't you know?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well do you see it or don't you?

               
                             JERRY
               Ahem. Say that again?

               
                             ELAINE
               Do you see it or don't you?

               
                             JERRY
               Do I see it... or don't I? That's the 
               question.
 
               
               Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. 
               He comes back groggy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Now what did you ask me again.

               
               Kramer is snoring.

               
               (Commercial)

               
               (Whew, Jerry is saved by the bell.)

               
               At the office. Elaine is walking by.

               
                             ELAINE
               You're still here. You're a dynamo.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't believe I get paid for this.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I'll see you tomorrow.

               
               Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady 
               comes by.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               How you doing?

               
                             CLEANING LADY
               Hello.

               
               The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the 
               lady as she is cleaning.
 
               
               At Monk's.

               
                             JERRY
               You had sex with the cleaning woman 
               on your desk? Who are you, how did you 
               do that?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hennigans. I was there sitting in the 
               office and the cleaning woman comes 
               in. I've always been attracted to cleaning 
               women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to 
               them too.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Why is that?

               
                             JERRY
               It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, 
               back and forth, her hips swivelling, 
               her breasts, uh... (trying to think 
               of a word)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Convulsing?

               
                             GEORGE
               Convulsing?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You don't drink.

               
                             GEORGE
               I know but I couldn't think of anything 
               else to say to her.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So you started drinking.

               
                             GEORGE
               So we started drinking, and I'll tell 
               you I don't know if it was the alcohol 
               or the ammonia, but the next think I 
               knew she was mopping the floor with 
               me.
 
               
                             JERRY
               So how was it?

               
                             GEORGE
               Well the sex was okay, but I threw up 
               from the Hennigans.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
 
               
               
               At Jerry's apartment.

               
                             ELAINE
               Dick was fired.

               
                             JERRY
               You mean to tell me if I had put that 
               drink six inches over to the right, 
               and none of this would have happened.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd 
               you put the drink down at all?
 
               
                             JERRY
               What are you saying?

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm not saying anything.

               
                             JERRY
               You're saying something.

               
                             ELAINE
               What could I be saying?

               
                             JERRY
               Well you're not saying nothing you must 
               be saying something.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               If I was saying something I would have 
               said it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well why don't you say it?

               
                             ELAINE
               I said it.

               
                             JERRY
               What did you say?

               
                             ELAINE
               Nothing. It's exhausting being with 
               you.
 
               
               Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah?

               
                             GEORGE
               (over the speaker) It's George.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, let me ask you something something. 
               Did George buy that sweater knowing 
               the red dot was on it because it was 
               cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, 
               you just gave me the answer.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No I didn't.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your 
               expression.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't have an expression. I have 
               a deviated septum. I have to open my 
               mouth sometimes to breathe.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               How much did he save?

               
                             JERRY
               Frankly I am shocked that you would 
               ask such a question (Elaine sticking 
               out her tongue like she isn't buying 
               a word of it) of me, that you would 
               think - the only surprise is how you 
               could even think of that. That's what 
               you were seeing.
 
               
               Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.

               
                             GEORGE
               I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing 
               lady is turning the screws on me. She's 
               pushing for this whole relationship 
               thing. She keeps calling me, threatening 
               to go to the boss with this thing, I 
               could lose my job, I gotta do something 
               to keep her quiet.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise 
               to whole red dot thing. She's asking 
               me all kinds of questions.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Did you tell her anything?

               
                             JERRY
               No.

               
                             GEORGE
               Do you swear?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh you told her didn't you.

               
                             JERRY
               No.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey George, did you buy that sweater 
               knowing that red dot was on it because 
               you could get it at a discount?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What? Did I what?

               
                             ELAINE
               You did didn't you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. 
               Here I go out in the spirit of the season 
               (Elaine looking like she's not buying 
               a word of it) and spend all my savings 
               to buy you the most beautiful Christmas 
               sweater I have ever seen to show my 
               appreciation to you at Christmas and 
               this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well Jerry told me that you did.

               
                             GEORGE
               You told her? How could you tell her? 
               I told you not to say anything.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. 
               She tricked you.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 
               temperature when I bought that sweater. 
               I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots 
               everywhere. I thought everything in 
               the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
               distinguish one red dot from another. 
               I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. 
               I haven't worked for a really long time. 
               (Jerry is standing right behind George. 
               Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts 
               fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have 
               no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. 
               It's just a little red dot.
 
               
               At the office.

               
                             GEORGE
               This is for you.

               
                             LADY
               Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? 
               Oh I knew you cared for me.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               As you care for me. Which is why it 
               is very important that you never breathe 
               a word of this to anyone about the... 
               you know. What, with Clarence Thomas 
               and everything.
 
               
                             LADY
               Okay, okay, can I open it now?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes of course go ahead. My guess is 
               you're going to like this very much.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               Oh! Is that cashmere?

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it's cashemere.

               
                             LADY
               A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Just a little something for Christmas.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               When I was a little girl in Panama, 
               a rich American came to our town and 
               he was wearing the softest most beautiful 
               sweater. I said to him, "what do you 
               call this most beautiful fabric?", and 
               he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated 
               the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked 
               if I could have it, and he said "No. 
               Get away from me." Then he started walk 
               away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming 
               for him to give me the sweater and he 
               dragged me through the street. And then 
               he kicked at me with the other foot 
               and threw some change at me. Oh, but 
               I didn't want the change Georgie. I 
               wanted the cashmere.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I had a feeling you would like it. No, 
               don't try it on now, try it on later.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
 
               
               
                             LADY
               (noticing the dot) What's this?

               
               At the comedy club.

               
                             JERRY
               I was in the men's room the other day 
               and they had the hand blower, instead 
               of the paper towels, you know this thing. 
               I like the hand blower I have to say. 
               It takes a little bit longer, but I 
               feel when you're in a room with a revolting 
               stench you want to spend as much time 
               as you can.
 
               
                             DICK
               The only stench is comming from you.
 
               
               
                             AUDIENCE
               Oooooh.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, wait a second, I believe we have 
               a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey 
               Dick I don't know what your problem 
               is. It's not my fault you're back on 
               the wagon.
 
               
                             DICK
               It's off the wagon.

               
                             JERRY
               In the old days how do you think they 
               got the alcohol from town to town?
 
               
               
                             DICK
               I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               On the wagon. Don't you think they broke 
               into a couple of those bottles along 
               the way?
 
               
                             DICK
               You can't drink on a wagon it would 
               be too bumpy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               They had smooth trails. What about the 
               Cumberland Gap?
 
               
                             DICK
               What the hell do you know about wagons?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I know enough not to get on them.

               
               In the boss' office.

               
                             BOSS
               I'm going to get right to the point. 
               It has come to my attention that you 
               and the cleaning woman have engaged 
               in sexual intercourse on the desk in 
               your office. Is that correct?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Who said that?

               
                             BOSS
               She did.

               
                             GEORGE
               Was that wrong? Should I have not done 
               that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance 
               on this thing because if anyone had 
               said anything to me at all when I first 
               started here that that sort of thing 
               was frouned upon, you know, cause I've 
               worked in a lot of offices and I tell 
               you peope do that all the time.
 
               
                             BOSS
               You're fired.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well you didn't have to say it like 
               that.
 
               
                             BOSS
               I want you out of here by the end of 
               the day.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What about the whole Christmas spirit 
               thing? Any flexability there?
 
               
                             BOSS
               Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give 
               you this.
 
               
               He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. 
               George walks out of the office "wearing" it.
 
               
               In the hall of the office.

               
                             ELAINE
               You had sex on your desk with the cleaning 
               woman.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You never had sex in the office before?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No. I once made out with someone but 
               that was it.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright so you made out with someone.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well that's not sex.

               
                             GEORGE
               Kissing is sex.

               
                             ELAINE
               Kissing is not sex.

               
                             JERRY
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next 
               to Dick's on purpose?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               George?

               
                             GEORGE
               Over here.

               
                             ELAINE
               What are you doing here?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm taking the kid out to dinner to 
               chear him up.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey Jerry when do you consider that 
               sex has taken place?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I would say when the nipple makes its 
               first appearance.
 
               
               (Commercial)

               
                             ELAINE
               So, George told me that you left the 
               drink next to Dick's on purpose.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Nice try. So guess who heckled me at 
               the club last night.
 
               
               *crash*

               
                             DICK
               Merry Christmas.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hide, hide under the desk.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ow, ow move over.

               
                             JERRY
               Get off of me.

               
                             ELAINE
               I've got no room.

               
               Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks 
               down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, 
               his hand shaking.
 
               
                             DICK
               Is that cashmere?

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course it's cashmere.

               
                             DICK
               (noticing the dot) What's this?

               
               At the comedy club.

               
                             JERRY
               But in a way, I think I inadvertantly 
               turned this guy into an alcoholic. I 
               hate being around alcoholics because 
               they're either telling you how much 
               they love you or how much they hate 
               you. And those are the two statements 
               that scare me the most. But I think 
               he's okay now because I have no idea 
               how he feels about me. He's finally 
               off the wagon.
 
               
                             DICK
               You mean on the wagon.

               
                             JERRY
               Don't get smart.

               
               
                            THE END

               (Comedy club)

               
               So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold 
               medication.  You
 
               ever try and pick one of these out?  It's not easy.  It's a wall. 
                It's an
 
               entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, 
               "Alright,
 
               alright, alright, okay, what the hell--  This is quick acting, 
               but this is long
 
               lasting.  When do I need to feel good, now or later?"  It's a 
               tough question.
 
               And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show 
               you what's wrong
 
               with the guy, you know?  They always show you, like, all the 
               problems that he's
 
               having.  First of all, the always show you the human body, which 
               is usually this
 
               guy.  No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the 
               public.  And he's
 
               always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are 
               going through him
 
               or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning 
               is attacking him.
 
               I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?"  "Yes 
               I am."  "Are
 
               you having any lightning with the pain?"

               
               
               First scene.

               Jerry and George are in a drug store.

               
                             JERRY
               How did you get fleas?

               
                             GEORGE
               Because my cousin's imbecile dog was 
               rolling around outside and they
 
               got in his carpet.

               
                             JERRY
               Maybe you can get yourself a little 
               bowtie flea collar.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               That's not funny.  So, are you coming 
               to the party?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far 
               out, it smacks of desperation.  The
 
               
               whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all 
               the way out from
 
               Manhattan for this?"

               
                             GEORGE
               You know Ava's gonna be there.

               
                             JERRY
               Who?

               
                             GEORGE
               The nice one that works in my office.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Nah.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'll drive.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, well, now you're talking.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's supposed to be a good party.

               
                             JERRY
               What does that mean, good dip?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, there'll be girls there.

               
                             JERRY
               There's girls everywhere.  I go out 
               of my apartment, there's girls in
 
               
               the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?

               
                             GEORGE
               There's a hundred different things here. 
                What's the difference between
 
               these two?  (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) 
                You got
 
               propylparabin?

               
                             JERRY
               Got it.

               
                             GEORGE
               You got isobutane-30?

               
                             JERRY
               I got isobutane-20.

               
                             GEORGE
               A-ha.

               
                             JERRY
               You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?

               
                             GEORGE
               Got it.

               
                             JERRY
               I have aloe!

               
                             GEORGE
               You got aloe?  I love aloe.

               
                             JERRY
               Where do they make yours?

               
                             GEORGE
               Jersey.

               
                             JERRY
               White Plains.

               
               George puts down the "Jersey" box and grabs the "White Plains" 
               box from Jerry
 
               and they go to the check out counter.  Two women are standing 
               at the magazine
 
               rack in the background.

               
                             JERRY
               Girls.  There's girls right here in 
               the store.  Look, look, there's one
 
               
               over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside 
               there'll be
 
               girls out there.  What's the matter?

               
                             GEORGE
               I gave her a twenty, she only gave me 
               change for a ten.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar 
               bill and you
 
               only actually gave me change for a ten.

               
                             CASHIER
               You gave me a ten.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm positive I gave you a twenty.

               
                             CASHIER
               I know what you gave me.

               
                             GEORGE
               You owe me ten dollars.

               
                             CASHIER
               Will you please step aside?  Next?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, let's just examine the situation 
               for a second.  Who, in this
 
               situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had 
               access to my
 
               wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--

               
                             CASHIER
               You.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
 
               
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               What's the problem here?

               
                             GEORGE
               No problem.  There's no problem.  She 
               just owes me ten dollars, that's
 
               all.

               
                             CASHIER
               He's claiming short.

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Alright, let's just take it outside.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, so you don't believe me either?
 
               
               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Come on, let's go.

               
                             GEORGE
               You haven't won.  You may think you've 
               won, but you haven't won.  Do
 
               you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting 
               what's
 
               happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back. 
                Alright, don't
 
               worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be 
               back.
 
               
               
               New scene.

               George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door 
               .
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well don't stand here, let's walk in, 
               blend in, blend in.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, let's survey first.  Camp here.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Eva.

               
               A beautiful woman starts walking over.

               
                             JERRY
               What could possess anyone to throw a 
               party?  I mean, to have a bunch of
 
               
               strangers treat your house like a hotel room.

               
                             AVA
               So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?

               
                             AVA
               Yesterday

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't believe it.

               
                             AVA
               Ask Mark.

               
                             GEORGE
               Mark, is this true?

               
               A man across the room nods.  George and Ava walk towards him.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, this has got disaster written 
               all over it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               How did I ever let you talk me into 
               this, I must have been out of my
 
               mind.

               
                             JERRY
               Now listen, let's keep an eye on each 
               other tonight.  In case one of us
 
               
               gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're 
               in trouble so
 
               the other one can get us out of it.

               
                             ELAINE
               How old are you?

               
                             JERRY
               Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout 
               this?  Chicken wing?  No, no,
 
               no, I got a better one.  Head patting.

               
                             ELAINE
               Whatever you want.

               
               
               Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.
 
               
               
                             GUY
               You came all the way out from Manhattan 
               for this?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, yeah I did.

               
                             GUY
               So what do you do?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm a comedian.

               
                             GUY
               Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  
               Where do you get your material?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I hear a voice.

               
                             GUY
               What kind of voice?

               
                             JERRY
               A man's voice, but he speaks in German 
               so I have to get a translator.
 
               
                             GUY
               How come you keep tapping your head.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.
 
               
               
               Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and 
               patting her head.
 
               
                             GUY
               On the other hand, you take a guy like 
               George Washington Carver.  The man
 
               
               devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much 
               passion for
 
               something.

               
               Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.

               
                             GUY
               Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny 
               guy.
 
               
               Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.
 
               
               
                             GUY
               I've often wondered if he ever worked 
               with the pecan.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, me too.

               
                             GUY
               Now is that considered a nut, because 
               I know the cashew is a legume.
 
               
               Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.

               
                             GEORGE
               How's it going?

               
                             JERRY
               Great, how about you?

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't believe what's happening here. 
                She hasn't taken her hands off
 
               me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but 
               that was it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How do you account for this?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her 
               head.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, she obviously liked you all along.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, I would have picked up on it.  I 
               can always tell when a woman likes
 
               
               me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture 
               me, I
 
               wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I 
               don't like them,
 
               then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking 
               at me, he must
 
               have something going for him."

               
                             JERRY
               Anyway, I'm ready to go.

               
                             GEORGE
               Now?

               
                             JERRY
               If not now, when?

               
                             GEORGE
               Gimme a half-hour.

               
                             JERRY
               Okay, half-hour.

               
               Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from 
               tapping.
 
               
                             GUY
               Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut 
               oil...
 
               
                             JERRY
               Can I talk to you for a second?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with 
               Jerry)  What have you been doing,
 
               
               I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental 
               patient.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey, I was dying over there.

               
                             ELAINE
               This guy's going off on the peanut. 
                Now pay attention.
 
               
               Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.

               
                             ELLEN
               Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. 
                You talk about a lot of every
 
               day things, right?

               
                             JERRY
               Right.

               
                             ELLEN
               Yeah, I remember you.

               
               Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting 
               on the couch
 
               near a pretentious woman.

               
                             WOMAN
               I wonder what happened to my fiancé. 
                I know he's here somewhere.
 
               Ellen?  Have you seen my fiancé?

               
                             ELLEN
               He's upstairs.

               
                             WOMAN
               Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fiancé 
               I'm looking for him.  I have
 
               lost my fiancé, the poor baby.

               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

               
                             WOMAN
               What?

               
                             ELAINE
               The dingo ate your baby!

               
               Cut to George and Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               You ready?

               
                             GEORGE
               Listen, I have a tremendous favor to 
               ask.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I do favors.

               
                             GEORGE
               I think something's happening here.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               I think she wants me to take her home.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Wow.

               
                             GEORGE
               What should I do?

               
                             JERRY
               Go!  What could you do?

               
                             GEORGE
               What about you and Elaine?

               
                             JERRY
               We'll get a ride.

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you sure?

               
                             JERRY
               We'll be fine, what did she say?

               
                             GEORGE
               She told me she wants-- (Pauses until 
               a woman coming down the stairs
 
               passes)  She told me she wants me to make love to her.

               
                             JERRY
               What?  She said that?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Get out of here.

               
                             GEORGE
               I swear.

               
                             JERRY
               What did you say?

               
                             GEORGE
               I, I, I can't.

               
                             JERRY
               What did you say?

               
                             GEORGE
               Please, it's--

               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               I... I... I long for you.

               
                             JERRY
               I long for you?

               
                             GEORGE
               I was so shocked I was lucky I said 
               anything.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's okay, that's not bad.

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't like when a woman says, 'Make 
               love to me', it's intimidating.
 
               The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing 
               to her.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Really?

               
                             GEORGE
               That's a lot of pressure.  Make love 
               to me.  What am I, in the circus?
 
               
               What if I can't deliver?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, come on.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't perform under pressure.  That's 
               why I never play anything for
 
               money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my 
               office, can you
 
               imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe 
               I should
 
               cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.

               
                             JERRY
               George, you're thinking too much.

               
                             GEORGE
               I know, I know, I can't stop it!

               
               Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts 
               for Pendant Publishing.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Pendant?  Those bastards.

               
                             ELAINE
               Excuse me.

               
                             JERRY
               Listen, George is going home with this 
               Ava from his office
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we 
               can go now?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Uh, no, he's taking the car.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I don't know.

               
                             ELAINE
               You don't know?

               
                             JERRY
               Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could 
               you let him take the car?
 
               
                             JERRY
               There's nothing I could do, it's part 
               of the code.
 
               
               
               Mid-episode monologue

               
               All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly 
               have an
 
               opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never 
               met each other
 
               ever in life.  This is the male code.  And it doesn't matter 
               how important the
 
               arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a 
               space shuttle
 
               mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his 
               way to the launch
 
               pad.  They hold that countdown.  He's leaning against the rocket 
               talking to her,
 
               "So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for 
               some Tang?"
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh look at that.  Look at what she's 
               wearing.
 
               You see what she's wearing?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, yeah, alright.

               
                             ELAINE
               I can't believe she's walking around 
               in that.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Just don't make a scene.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, is that real fur?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh boy.

               
                             EVA
               It better be or my ex-husband owes me 
               an explanation.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, good night.

               
                             ELAINE
               You don't care that innocent defenseless 
               animals are being tortured so
 
               that you can look good?

               
                             GEORGE
               Could we talk about this some other 
               time?
 
               
                             AVA
               Are you a vegetarian?

               
                             JERRY
               Here we go.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.

               
                             AVA
               So you're a hypocrite.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. 
                Anyway-
 
               
                             AVA
               Well, talk to me when you stop eating 
               fish.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Fish don't feel any pain.

               
                             AVA
               How do you know?  Do you communicate 
               with fish?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, they're not kept in little cages.
 
               
               
                             AVA
               Ever seen a goldfish?

               
                             GEORGE
               Goldfish.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're 
               not unhappy.
 
               
                             AVA
               Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl 
               for two weeks and get flushed down
 
               
               the toilet, that's a good life.  (To George)  Let's go.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go 
               ahead, maybe you can run over a
 
               squirrel!

               
                             GEORGE
               That's why we're here in America.

               
                             JERRY
               You're beautiful.

               
                             ELAINE
               Call Kramer.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, 
               this is your party, right?
 
               
                             STEVE
               No, I just live here.

               
                             JERRY
               Can I use your phone?

               
                             STEVE
               What's in it for me?

               
                             JERRY
               A bigger bill?

               
                             STEVE
               He he, go for it.

               
               Jerry picks up the phone and dials.

               
                             JERRY
               Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  
               Well, I'm stuck out here on Long
 
               Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure? 
                Okay, but don't
 
               leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.
 
               
               
               Cut to several hours later.  The party has ended.  The hosts, 
               Steve and Jenny,
 
               are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.

               
                             ELAINE
               You sure you don't need any help?

               
                             JENNY
               No, not really.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
 
               
               
                             JENNY
               I want them out of here.

               
                             ELAINE
               Call him again.

               
                             JERRY
               I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) 
               We really appreciate this.
 
               
                             JENNY
               It's two o'clock in the morning.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw
 
               
               some of that show, it was wonderful.

               
                             ELAINE
               Six hundred and twenty million people 
               died.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Thousand.

               
                             ELAINE
               Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand. 
                The horror, the horror.
 
               (To Jerry)  The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure 
               you gave him the
 
               right directions?

               
                             JERRY
               Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's 
               nothing we can do?
 
               
                             JENNY
               No!  (To Steve)  I am not going to bed 
               with them in out house, this is
 
               ridiculous.

               
                             JERRY
               You know a friend of my father's used 
               to live right around here.  Mike
 
               Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could 
               bend them.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Have you noticed, people don't use straws 
               as much as they used to for
 
               some reason.

               
                             JENNY
               You know, it doesn't look as if your 
               friend is coming.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, he's coming.

               
                             JENNY
               Maybe you should take a look at a train 
               schedule.
 
               
               Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               That's him.

               
                             JENNY
               I'm going to bed!

               
                             ELAINE
               Thanks a lot.

               
                             JERRY
               Thanks, great party.

               
               As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve 
               answers.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, how ya doing?

               
                             STEVE
               Ah, look who's here.

               
                             KRAMER
               I'm sorry.

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, it's okay.

               
                             KRAMER
               I had the directions on the seat right 
               next to me, they flew out the
 
               window.

               
                             ELAINE
               Then how did you find the place?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well I knew the exit on the Long Island 
               Expressway, and I thought that
 
               the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around 
               knocking on
 
               everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, 
               whoo.
 
               Finally, I hit it.  8173.

               
                             JERRY
               Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us 
               stay here, Steve, I really owe you
 
               
               one.

               
                             STEVE
               No problem.

               
                             JERRY
               And if you're ever in the city, you 
               know, you want to come to a comedy
 
               
               club, whatever.

               
                             STEVE
               Hey, I might take you up on that.

               
                             JERRY
               Here's my address and number.  And really, 
               thanks again.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               You better zip up.  I couldn't get the 
               top on the
 
               convertible up.

               
                             ELAINE
               But it's cold out.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
 
               
               
               
               New scene.

               Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.

               
                             JERRY
               George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine 
               was too.  Eighty miles an hour,
 
               forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, 
               maybe I will
 
               get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. 
                Okay, meet me down
 
               there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's. 
                Okay bye.
 
               
               Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the 
               door.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Who is it?

               
                             VOICE
               Mr. Pocatello.

               
                             JERRY
               Who?

               
                             VOICE
               You mean you don't recognize my voice?
 
               
               
               Jerry opens the door.  Steve steps in.

               
                             STEVE
               Jerry, baby!

               
                             JERRY
               Do I know you?

               
                             STEVE
               Boy this comedy's really frying your 
               brain.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm sorry, uh-

               
                             STEVE
               See, this is the kind of lasting impression 
               I make on people.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, okay.

               
                             STEVE
               You said if I was ever in the city, 
               I'm in the city.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You certainly are.  What's going on?
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               I'm just waiting for a lift back to 
               the island, he won't be ready until
 
               
               eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see 
               what it was like
 
               to hang out with someone in show business.

               
                             JERRY
               Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just 
               on my way out to meet a friend.
 
               
                             STEVE
               Oh, come on, you can come up with something 
               better than that.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, really, I just got off the phone 
               with him.
 
               
                             STEVE
               I understand.

               
                             JERRY
               Look, you can hang out here if you want.
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               Don't be so enthusiastic.

               
                             JERRY
               No, it's-

               
                             STEVE
               I'm not gonna steal anything.

               
                             JERRY
               No, of course not, just close the door 
               when you leave.
 
               
                             STEVE
               I think I can do that.

               
                             JERRY
               Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.
 
               
               
                             STEVE
               Yeah.  Let's have lunch.

               
               
               New scene.

               Jerry and George are at the drug store.

               
                             JERRY
               They guy's in my house right now.  What 
               a mistake that party was, I
 
               never should have gone.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, me either.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, come on.

               
                             GEORGE
               What come on?  Have you ever dated a 
               woman that worked in your office?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I've never had a job.

               
                             GEORGE
               You know the anxiety you feel on a date? 
                That's what I have every day
 
               now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.

               
                             JERRY
               That's one of Dante's nine stages of 
               hell, isn't it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Ava was one of the reasons I used to 
               like going to work, she was a
 
               friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how 
               to talk to her.
 
               Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan 
               little patter.
 
               I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office 
               and analyze
 
               how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the 
               bathroom for the
 
               rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, 
               they're all
 
               so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to 
               go back there
 
               again.'

               
                             JERRY
               What are you gonna do?

               
                             GEORGE
               I have no choice, I'm quitting.

               
               
               Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV. 
                Kramer walks in
 
               and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.

               
                             KRAMER
               The party, Long Island?

               
                             STEVE
               Kramer, right?

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, what are you doing here?

               
                             STEVE
               I'm waiting for my ride.

               
                             KRAMER
               Where's Jerry?

               
                             STEVE
               He split.  Let me ask you something. 
                Is there anything to drink in here
 
               
               or is that, like, a stupid question?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. 
                (Sensing Steve's
 
               disappointment)  Well, but I might have something.

               
               Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.  Jerry is selecting 
               medication.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks 
               good.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               How much is that?

               
                             JERRY
               Nine sixty.

               
                             GEORGE
               Nine sixty?  Give it to me.

               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
                             GEORGE
               Don't worry, I got it.

               
                             JERRY
               What do you mean, you got it?

               
                             GEORGE
               I got it.

               
               George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket.

               
                             JERRY
               Since when are you treating me to medicine? 
                What are you doing?  You're
 
               stealing this, aren't you?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten 
               dollars.  They stole from me.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You're a lunatic.

               
                             GEORGE
               I have to do this, it's a matter of 
               honor.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What do you say to a person like you?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Just walk.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh.

               
               A security guard approaches George.

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               Scuse me.  What do you got there?

               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               What do you got in your shirt?

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, I was gonna pay for this.

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               
               Come with me.

               
                             GEORGE
               Where are you taking me?  I was gonna 
               pay for it.
 
               
                             CASHIER
               um-hmm.

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               You don't think I remember you?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you talking about?

               
                             SECURITY GUARD
               I know who you are, I was watching you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna 
               call the police?
 
               
               The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Can I still buy this or is this evidence 
               now?
 
               
               Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.  Kramer 
               is in the middle
 
               of a story.

               
                             KRAMER
               So, I'm chasing these doves down the 
               street and she's screaming at the
 
               
               top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from 
               Europe, two of them
 
               turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!

               
               They both erupt in raucous laughter.

               
                             STEVE
               Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!! (the 
               laughter winds down)
 
               So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Not really.

               
                             STEVE
               Maybe we should call one of those escort 
               services.  I saw one of them
 
               advertised before on the cable station.

               
               Kramer (handing Steve the phone)  555-LOVE.

               
                             STEVE
               Hey, you want in on this?

               
                             KRAMER
               No, I got a girl in the next building
 
               
               
               
               New scene.

               Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he 
               hears a woman's
 
               voice from inside.

               
                             VOICE
               Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't 
               leaving until I get it.  Now I
 
               am through playing games with you, I got things to do.

               
                             STEVE
               Oh Jerry!  Jerry!  Look who's here, 
               it's Jerry
 
               
                             JERRY
               What the hell?

               
                             STEVE
               Jerry, this is Patti.

               
                             JERRY
               Nice to meet you.

               
                             PATTI
               It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, 
               I'm sure.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What the hell is going on here?

               
                             STEVE
               I don't know, but I gotta do this more 
               often.  (The buzzer goes off)
 
               Ooh, there's my ride, finally.

               
                             PATTI
               I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get 
               the rest of my money.
 
               
                             STEVE
               See ya, Jerr.  And tell Kramer thanks 
               and I'll call him tomorrow.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, Kramer huh?

               
                             STEVE
               Yeah, he's a hoot.  Oh, goodbye, my 
               dear.  (trying to kiss Patti's hand
 
               
               as she pulls it away)  Ouch.  (To Jerry)  Weekend of the 26th, 
               come on out,
 
               we're having another party.

               
               Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.

               
                             PATTI
               I ain't leaving.

               
                             JERRY
               Patti?

               
                             PATTI
               You got anything to drink?

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, how much does he owe you?
 
               
               
                             PATTI
               Fifty dollars.

               
                             JERRY
               Fifty dollars.

               
               In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.

                             JERRY
               Yeah, but--

               
                             COP
               You're under arrest for solicitation

               Wait a second, I--

               
               Elaine walks in.

               
                             ELAINE
               I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti) 
                Is that real fur?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh boy.

               
               
               New scene.

               Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating 
               pizza.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.

               
                             JERRY
               He was a nice guy.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, great guy.

               
                             JERRY
               Was there a red-headed guy there?

               
                             GEORGE
               The one with the long sideburns?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               Where does he come off?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that 
               kind of attitude.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               One of the guys in my cell threw a piece 
               of gum at him.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, we all hated him.

               There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor. 
                You can measure
 
               the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after 
               they ask you to 'do
 
               me a favor.'  Small favor, small pause.  Can you do me a favor, 
               hand me that
 
               pencil?  No pause at all.  Big favors are, 'Could you do me a 
               favor...' (huge
 
               pause, followed by closing credits.)

               All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can 
               take the B or the F and switch
 
               
               for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge 
               to DeKalb
 
               
               and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 
               3, 4 or 5,
 
               
               but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind 
               up on Smith
 
               
               and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.

               That's what Willie Loman told Biff before

               a salesman'.

               What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, 
               very encouraging. The
 
               
               biggest loser in history of American literature.

               and groom out, what do they
 
               
               flip a coin?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, they flip a coin.

               
                             GEORGE
               What, was that not politically correct? 
               It's a legitimate question.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that

               I get the feeling when lesbians are 
               looking at me, they're
 
               
                             THINKING
               "That's why I'm not heterosexual".

                             JERRY
               Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Why do I always pay? What am I made 
               of money? You bunch of
 
               
               deadbeats.

               registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah.

               I'm fighting that one. You know, this 
               is gonna cost me over six
 
               
               hundred bucks.

               some change, except George.

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't carry any changes in these pants, 
               it falls out.

                             GEORGE
               That guy is not blind.

               
                             JERRY
               So, can I convince anybody to come down 
               to Coney Island with me? I
 
               
               got to pick up my car at the pound. George?

               
                             GEORGE
               I can't believe they actually found 
               your stolen car.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Not only that they found it. It was 
               simonized and the front end was
 
               
               aligned.

               
                             GEORGE
               That's amazing.

               
                             JERRY
               So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. 
               Hotdogs on Nathan's is on
 
               
               me.

               What are you? Satan? I'm close to a 
               job here. It's my second
 
               
               interview with them.

               
                             JERRY

                             KRAMER
               I've gotta go to court, I'll get in 
               trouble. What's the matter with
 
               
               you?

               
                             JERRY
               Could be years before I get back to 
               Coney Island. I can't go to
 
               
               rides alone.

               Another subway. Jerry comes in and sits down. Fat man across 
               him gives a
 
               
               look.

               
               George gets on another subway. Sits next to a beautiful woman. 
               They smile to
 
               
               another.

               
               Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. 
               Stumbles
 
               
               around as all seats get filled right before him.

               
               He squeezes himself to same seat with obese young man.

               
               Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves 
               and Jerry
 
               
               falls in his seat.

               
               
               
               Woman next to George rubs her leg and George looks at her.

               
                             WOMAN
               You looking for a job?

               
                             GEORGE
               Me, why?

               
                             WOMAN
               Well, you're reading the classifieds.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, no no no. I was just looking for 
               stock-pages. Here it is.
 
               
               Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. 
               Oh, IBM
 
               
               up a quarter.

               
                             WOMEN
               You didn't look like someone who needed 
               a job.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing 
               very well, very well, yep.
 
               
                             WOMEN
               So, you're in 'the market'?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.

               
                             WOMEN
               Which market?

               
                             GEORGE
               Which market, the, eh, big one, the 
               big market, the big board.
 
               
               Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.

               
                             WOMEN
               So, do you work for one of those big 
               broker-houses?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. 
               Hate them with a passion.
 
               
               Big broker-houses killed my father.

               
                             WOMAN
               Really?

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt 
               his feelings. It's a long
 
               
               story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that 
               I would
 
               
               never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is 
               money. I'm
 
               
               about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way 
               and I've
 
               
               never looked back.

               
               Train horn blows and George looks back

               
               
               
               Elaine's train. She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman 
               approaches
 
               
               her

               
                             WOMAN
               I started riding these trains in the 
               forties. Those days a man would
 
               
               give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have 
               to stand.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               It's ironic.

               
                             WOMEN
               What's ironic?

               
                             ELAINE
               This, that we've come all this way, 
               we have made all this progress,
 
               
               but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.

               
                             WOMAN
               No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh...

               
                             WOMAN
               Where are you up to, with such a nice 
               present, birthday party?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               A wedding.

               
                             WOMEN
               A wedding?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah

               
                             WOMAN
               Hah, I didn't know people still get 
               married. It's hard today with
 
               
               men and women.

               
                             ELAINE
               You're telling me.

               
                             WOMAN
               So, are they a nice couple?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, very nice.

               
                             WOMAN
               What does he do, if you don't mind me 
               asking?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               She.

               
                             WOMEN
               She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds 
               like my son.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               There is no he.

               
                             WOMEN
               There is no he. So, who's getting married?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
 
               
               
                             WOMEN
               Lesbian wedding.

               
                             ELAINE
               Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
 
               
               
                             WOMEN
               My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the
 
               
               
               subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm 
               not a lesbian! I hate men,
 
               
               but I'm not a lesbian!

               
               
               
               Kramer's train. A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat.
 
               
               
               Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the 
               paper. The
 
               
               other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece 
               of one page.
 
               
               
               
               Jerry's train. He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to 
               the floor.
 
               
               Man across gives him a look.

               
               
               
               Elaine's train. Train is full packed.

               
                             ELAINE'S VOICE
               I'm really looking forward to this. 
               I love weddings. Maybe
 
               
               I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.

               
               Train suddenly stops

               
                             ELAINE'S VOICE
               Oh, man. We're stopping?

               
               
               
               George's train.

               
                             WOMAN
               Well, this is where I get off.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, you do?

               
                             WOMAN
               Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, no, what, what?

               
                             WOMAN
               Well, I was going to say: why don't 
               you get off with me, but you're
 
               
               obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or 
               something.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, well....

               
                             WOMAN
               Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.

               
               George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs 
               after her
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, what's another million, give or 
               take. I get off where and when
 
               
               I wanna get off.

               
               He gets stuck between closing doors.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. 
               Don't start the train!
 
               
               Don't start the train!!

               
               
               
               Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking.
 
               
               
                             MAN1
               This, it's the fourth horse of the first 
               race, Pappanick.
 
               
                             MAN2
               How do you know it's going to win?
 
               
               
                             MAN1
               My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses 
               are regular customers.
 
               
               Every horse he has ever given me has won.

               
               See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's 
               been
 
               
               getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout 
               hasn't
 
               
               been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna 
               break his
 
               
               
               a lock.

               
                             MAN2
               But it rained last night.

               
                             MAN1
               Exactly, this horse loves the slop. 
               It's in his bloodlines. His
 
               
               father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'.

               
                             MAN2
               His mudda' was a mudda'?

               
                             MAN1
               What did I just say? Come on, let's 
               go to the office, I'm going to
 
               
               call my bookie. Hey, don't tell anybody.

               
               Kramer quickly turns away

               
               
               
               Jerry wakes up and looks to guy opposite to him. The fat guy 
               is naked and
 
               
               reading a paper.

               
                             JERRY
               O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
 
               
               
                             NAKED MAN
               Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
 
               
               
                             NAKED MAN
               You got something against naked body?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I got something against yours. How about 
               a couple of deep knee bends,
 
               
               maybe a squat thrust?

               
                             NAKED MAN
               Who's got time for squat thrusts?

               
                             JERRY
               All right, how about skipping breakfast. 
               I'm guessing you're not a
 
               
               'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.

               
                             NAKED MAN
               I like a good breakfast.

               
                             JERRY
               I understand, I like good breakfast. 
               Long as you don't wind up
 
               
               trapped in a room with bimbo broals(?) and pigtails, been counseled 
               by Dick
 
               
               Gregory.

               
                             NAKED MAN
               I'm not ashamed of my body.

               
                             JERRY
               That's your problem, you should be.
 
               
               
               Naked man drops half of his newspaper

               
                             JERRY
               Don't get up, please, allow me.

               
               Jerry picks up the paper

               
               
               
               Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train.

               
                             ELAINE'S VOICE
               Oh, this is great. This is what I need, 
               just what I need.
 
               
               Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the 
               track, we're
 
               
               stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so 
               many people?
 
               
               This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? 
               What is
 
               
               so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I 
               feel
 
               
               something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people 
               should be in
 
               
               a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the 
               ring.
 
               
               What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, 
               I can't
 
               
               breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. 
               Think about
 
               
               the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. 
               And
 
               
               hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about 
               that. This
 
               
               is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! 
               Help
 
               
               me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? 
               What
 
               
               can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! 
               How can a
 
               
               train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think 
               the
 
               
               conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay 
               we'll be
 
               
               moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my 
               leg?!!
 
               
               Lights in the train go off

               
               
               
               George and the woman step in to a hotel room.

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, 
               hey nice ice-bucket.
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Make your-self comfortable.

               
               She steps in to bathroom.

               
                             GEORGE'S VOICE
               Make myself comfortable. What does that 
               mean? Does she want
 
               
               me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What 
               if I take my
 
               
               clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like 
               an idiot.
 
               
               She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them 
               on, but what
 
               
               then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make 
               yourself
 
               
               comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing
 
               
               
               can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. 
               There,
 
               
               that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
 
               
               
               She comes out from the bathroom, wearing a nightie.

               
                             GEORGE
               Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
 
               
               
               
               
               Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. He is talking with 
               a guy

                             KRAMER
               Yeah, the little father has run his 
               hard out. They're gonna break
 
               
               his maiden.

               
                             GUY
               Really? But, it's a little bit slow 
               out there it rained last night.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves 
               it, eats it up. Eats the slob.
 
               
               Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.

               
                             GUY
               His father was a mudda'?

               
                             KRAMER
               His mother was a mudda'.

               
                             GUY
               His mother was a mudda'?

               What did I just say?

               Elaine is in a stopped train with no lights.

               Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars 
               my whole life
 
               
               could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out 
               of here. What
 
               
               if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 
               seconds. 1

               George and the beautiful woman are still in the hotel room. The 
               woman is
 
               
               putting handcuffs on George and the other end to the backboard 
               of the bed.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for 
               these things.
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Oh, don't worry. I do.

               
               She steps in to the bathroom

               
                             GEORGE
               You know, my mother used to walk around 
               on our apartment just in
 
               
               her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was 
               really
 
               
               disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and 
               fatter version
 
               
               of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing,
 
               
               
               cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who 
               was worse
 
               
               looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.

               
                             WOMAN
               Like what?

               
                             GEORGE
               Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than 
               Hazel. Hazel really puts
 
               
               your mother to shame"

               
               She comes out of the bathroom fully clothed

               
                             GEORGE
               What's going on?

               
                             WOMAN
               It was a pleasure doing business with 
               you George, but I'm afraid I
 
               
               have to get going.

               
                             GEORGE
               Get going? But we haven't really, you

               Eight dollars? Eight dollars?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you doing? You're robbing me?
 
               
               
                             WOMEN
               I wasted my whole morning with you for 
               eight dollars?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
 
               
               
                             WOMAN
               I'm taking your clothes.

               
                             GEORGE
               No, that's my only suit. It cost me 
               350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg 
               .
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Bye George.

               
                             GEORGE
               No wait, you can't just leave me here! 
               Will I see you again?
 
               
               
               
               Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. The race is on and 
               Pappanick
 
               
               is slowly making ground

               
               
               yes...

               
               The winner is Pappanick

               Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
 
               
               
               Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money 
               around.
 
               
               There is a big thug looking at the money.

               
               Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. 
               He makes
 
               
               a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and 
               so does the
 
               
               thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes.

               getting of
 
               
               the train.

               
                             
               I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 
               20 years.
 
               
                             JERRY
               First we ride the cyclone.

               
                             
               Chilly out.

               
               Jerry takes a deep breath

               
                             JERRY
               Aah, French fries.

               
               
               
               Kramer is running away from the thug and enters the train where 
               the blind
 
               
               violinist is playing. Kramer knocks down the violin player and 
               the thug
 
               
               picks Kramer up and looks for the money.

               
                             THUG
               Give me the money. Give me the money!
 
               
               
               
               Police!"

               
               
               
               Back to the Monk's café. Jerry, Kramer and Elaine are sitting 
               in a booth.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I never got the car. We were having 
               such a good time, by the
 
               
               time I got to the police garage, it was closed.

               
                             ELAINE
               Too bad.

               
                             JERRY
               You wouldn't believe what this guy put 
               away at Nathan's. Look at
 
               
               what we won!

               
               Waves around a stuffed monkey

               
                             JERRY
               You want him?

               
                             ELAINE
               Get that out of my face.

               
                             JERRY
               So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch 
               the bris!
 
               
               George enters wearing a sheet.

               
               
                             GEORGE
               How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' 
               fist on your throat, you little
 
               
               punk?

               
                             ELAINE
               George?

               
                             JERRY
               Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You have my spare-key in your apartment, 
               right?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.

               
                             GEORGE
               Give me your key, I gotta get it.

               
                             KRAMER
               What happened?

               
                             GEORGE
               Never mind what happened, just give 
               me the key.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Come on, I'll go with you.

               
                             ELAINE
               Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Wait, wait, wait...

               
               Kramer gets the check, looks at it and gets pile of cash and 
               pays. Jerry and Elaine look amazed.

               
               
               
                            THE END

               The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the 
               people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't 
               die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just 
               keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? 
               No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more 
               thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed 
               in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I say, 
               pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, 
               get a tune up. You know what I mean? There's nothing more rewarding 
               than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.

               Let me ask you a question. If you named 
               a kid Rasputin do you think that would 
               have a negative effect on his life?

               Na.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you doing? We're going out 
               for dinner in ten minutes.

               It's George.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. 
               You've got to fast for three days to 
               take an ulcer test. How you gonna do 
               that?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know. How could I possibly have 
               ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I think I'll take out the garbage.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey, have you ever fasted?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, once I didn't have dinner until, 
               like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. 
               (exits to hall with garbage – meets 
               George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? 
               Throw out my garbage for me.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, right.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on, it's just down the hall.

               
                             GEORGE
               Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two 
               bucks.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'll give you 50 cents.

               
                             GEORGE
               There's no way I touch that bag for 
               less than two dollars.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of 
               Drake's coffee cake
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You're not getting no Drake's Coffee 
               Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm 
               all set. I got the ticket. I'm going 
               to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I don't get you. Who goes on vacation 
               without a job? What do you need a break 
               from getting up at eleven?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               It's an incredible deal. I don't know 
               why you don't come with me.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable 
               deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm 
               not going to commit to an airline.

               Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee 
               Cake is?
 
               
                             GINA
               Of course, the plane cake with the sweet 
               brown crumbs on the top.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How much do they cost?

               
                             GINA
               The junior?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, no the full size.

               
                             JERRY
               No, no the junior.

               
                             GEORGE
               You didn't say "junior".

               
                             GINA
               I haven't had one of those since I was 
               a little girl.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. 
               I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters 
               the hall) How ya' doing?
 
               
                             MARTIN
               Good enough.

               
               (MARTIN leaves with Gina)

               
                             JERRY
               Boy she's sexy isn't she?

               
               (Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer's apartment and knocks on 
               the door. As he and George enter Jerry's apartment Kramer comes 
               out and takes the garbage bag.)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Do you believe that guy?

               
                             ELAINE
               What guy?

                             ELAINE
               Oh, that creepy guy?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, did he think I was flirting with 
               her?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He didn't seem too pleased.

               
                             ELAINE
               Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried 
               onion wings.

               something. I had a dream about that 
               guy last night. This is amazing.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What's so amazing? You've seen him before.

               I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport 
               Maine. ??? night club. The stage was 
               on a cliff and the audience was throwing 
               all the comics off.

               to a psychic.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Really?

               
                             ELAINE
               Uh uh, you should go some time.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'd love to go. Make an appointment.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Psychics, vacations. How about getting 
               a job?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I just got fired.

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I wonder what Ghandi ate before his 
               fast.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I heard he used to polish off a box 
               of Triscuits.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Really?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.

               It's Gina.

               
                             JERRY
               Who?

               Martine's girl friend.

               
                             JERRY
               Martine?

               
                             GINA
               You next door neighbour.

               Oh, Martin!

               It's Martine. I think he's dying. He 
               tried to kill himself with pills.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             GINA
               Come on.

               
                             JERRY
               In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
 
               
               
                             GINA
               We don't have enough time.

               
                             JERRY
               It'll take two seconds.

               
                             GINA
               There is no time.

               
                             JERRY
               We don't have two seconds?

               
                             GINA
               All right. Go ahead.

               
                             JERRY
               Nah, forget it.

               
                             GINA
               No, go ahead.

               
                             JERRY
               Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.

               
                             GINA
               Will you just get it.

               
                             JERRY
               Are you sure?

               
                             GINA
               Forget it. Come on.

               
                             JERRY
               Nah, I'll go get the robe.

               That's not too bad. It's not like a 
               Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said 
               he should snap out of it anytime.
 
               
               
                             GINA
               You know why he did this? Because I 
               told him it was over. I did not want 
               to see him anymore.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Really? It's over?

               
                             GINA
               I could not stand it another minute. 
               Yesterday he turned over a man's hot 
               dog stand because he thought the man 
               was looking at me. And then after he 
               saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy 
               with jealousy.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
 
               
               
                             GINA
               He does not like you. And all indications 
               are he does not like Drake's Coffee 
               Cake.
 
               
                             JERRY
               He said that?

               
                             GINA
               He was screaming about it all night. 
               How it's too sweet and it falls apart 
               when you eat it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I 
               was just being friendly.
 
               
                             GINA
               I wasn't.

               
                             JERRY
               You weren't?

               
                             GINA
               No, I have thought about you many times. 
               Have you thought about me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Of course.

               
                             GINA
               Tell me everything.

               Are you sure he can't hear anything?

                             GINA
               I wish he was not in a coma. I wish 
               he was dead. I wish I could pull the 
               plug out from him.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I, would, I would wait on that. I know 
               how you feel but. Juries today, you 
               never know how they're going to look 
               at a thing like this.
 
               
                             GINA
               I saw you looking at your watch. You 
               want to leave? Go ahead.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I just wanted to see what time it 
               was.
 
               
                             GINA
               Are you afraid of him?

               
                             JERRY
               No.

               
                             GINA
               Then kiss me.

               
                             JERRY
               Here?

               
                             GINA
               Yes, right here.

               
                             JERRY
               Is this the proper venue?

               
                             GINA
               You don't want to?

               
                             JERRY
               No, no, I want to. I, I very much want 
               to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
 
               
               
                             GINA
               Then kiss me right in front of him.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I can't. What if he wakes up?

               A man is lying here unconscious and 
               you're afraid of him? What kind of a 
               man are you?
 
               
                             JERRY
               A man who respects a good comma. If 
               it was one of those in and out comas, 
               maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going 
               like this ... you don't want to mess with 
               it.

                             JERRY
               Hey.

               
                             KRAMER
               Did you hear about Martin?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I heard.

               
                             KRAMER
               I can't believe he's in a coma.

               
                             KRAMER
               He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know 
               I loaned it to him. He never returned 
               it. The carpets are filthy. What am 
               I going to do?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Who told you about Martin?

                             KRAMER
               He's got all of my attachments, you 
               know.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey, let me ask you something. How long 
               do you have to wait for a guy to come 
               out of a coma before you can ask his 
               ex-girlfriend out?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call 
               Doctor Kavorkian?
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know I don't get that whole suicide 
               machine. There's no tall buildings where 
               these people live? They can't wrap their 
               lips around a revolver like a normal 
               person?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               So what's going on between you and Gina?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I went with her to the hospital 
               last night.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, uh.

               
                             JERRY
               So we're in the room and she's trying 
               to get me to kiss her right in front 
               of him.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing 
               about Mediterranean women. All right, 
               so what did you do?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Nothing.

               
                             KRAMER
               Ah, what kind of a man are you? The 
               guy is unconscious in a coma and you 
               don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I didn't know what the coma etiquette 
               was.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               There is no coma etiquette. You see 
               that's the beauty of the coma, man. 
               It doesn't matter what you do around 
               it.
 
               
                             JERRY

               his clothes, it's all up for grabs.

               I'd give him 24 hours to get out of 
               it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, 
               it's a land rush.

               So if the coma victim wakes up in a 
               month, he's thrilled, he got out of 
               the coma. He goes home, there's nothing 
               left?

               No.

               I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you 
               can hear me. Look my mother, she's going 
               to come and visit me. She sees that 
               rug, she's going to kill me.

               He can't hear you, you idiot. Why don't 
               you just buy another one.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Why would I buy another one when I spent 
               a hundred bucks on this one?

               I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               I don't want a carpet sweeper. They 
               don't do anything.
 
               
                             W
               It gets my rug clean.

               
                             KRAMER
               The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam 
               perpetrated on the American public since 
               One Hour Martinizing.
 
               
                             W
               Well, you should take a look at my rug 
               then.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I wouldn't set foot in your house.

               Hello.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Hello Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               How's he doing?

               
                             KRAMER
               He looks happy to me.

               
                             NEWMAN
               I hope he stays this happy when he wakes 
               up.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Why wouldn't he?

               
                             NEWMAN
               No reason.

               
                             JERRY
               He'll have a lot of catching up to do, 
               I guess.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               I'll bring him up to date.

               
                             JERRY
               How up to date?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Oh, all the way up.

                             NEWMAN
               Well, it would take a hell of a lot. 
               Because a friend is something you earn.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free 
               tickets to the Cayman Islands for this 
               weekend. He's not going.

                             JERRY
               From my house. I got a whole box of 
               them.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Boy, that's the full size.

               
                             JERRY
               That's your big boy.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Can I have a bite?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't give out bites. I got another 
               one. But I'm saving it for later.
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               Just one bite?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't think so. You know they, they're 
               so fragile.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               All right! All right. I won't say anything.

               I swear.

               Oh, you know what? The second day I 
               was there I stepped on a jellyfish. 
               Now it kind of stung my foot. That's 
               probably what Rula was trying to warn 
               you about.
 
               
                             GEORGE

               Oh, it's an invitation to a house warming 
               from Martin and Gina.
 
               
                             KRAMER

               ....hair that was on your shower soap 
               today could be in your head tomorrow. 
               How did they do the first transplant?
 
               
               
               Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it 
               in there by helicopter, you know
 
               
               keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. 
               "We got the hair but I think we lost
 
               
               the Zest."

               
               ....rejects the transplant with organs.

               
               Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . 
               Guy just standin' there and suddenly...

               Jerry's apartment. A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry 
               doing work with headphones on.

               So I took off the motor relay on the 
               compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) 
               you've got some discoloration

                             GEORGE
               Oh! you taped it?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah , I was doing new material.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the 
               toes that I said .
 
               
                             JERRY
               Huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain 
               of the toes, but sometimes the toe next 
               to the big toe gets so
 
               
               big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes 
               control of the foot.

                             GEORGE
               It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and 
               he is taping from a Camcorder) This 
               Chinese doctor Zeng Zau.
 
               
               has discovered a cure for baldness.

               
                             JERRY
               ( to Kramer) What's this?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well I just got it. Spector gave it 
               to me , he's giving everything away...becoming 
               a minimalist.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Is that the guy who likes fat women?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with 
               the minimalism.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               ( to George) You , you know what you 
               should've done is watching that report 
               on CNN last night.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I did, I'm trying to call China.

               
                             KRAMER

                             JERRY
               Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! 
               I can't believe what I'm hearing. This 
               woman his talking to
 
               
               me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've 
               never heard anything like this in my life.

                             GEORGE

                             JERRY
               It was in the back of the room on the 
               left, she must have been sitting right 
               in front of it.
 
               
                             GEORGE

                             GEORGE
               What do the Chinese have to gain by 
               faking a cure for baldness?
 
               
                             JERRY
               If it was real ,they would never let 
               it out of the country. No baldness , 
               it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

               film work.

                             GEORGE
               Why do you have to be so suspicious 
               of every one. This is a great man Zeng 
               Zau, he wants to help bald people.

               Happy camper , I don't hear that expression 
               enough.
 
               
               Kramer; Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found 
               at my mother's house.

                             KRAMER

               comes out of the bathroom and he's got 
               white cream on his head)

               on for?

               them all lined up like the Daltons ,all 
               looking at her
 
               
               with lust.) I think I'll get going...

               She leaves and they all scramble for the tape recorder.

               Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... 
               what kind of a sicko
               would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide 
               (small fingers opening
               imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT 
               hard to get round black
               buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like 
               this? ... is it such a
               great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, 
               you'll never find them - they
               save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know 
               they're going to fall off too, that's the other thing ...

               barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief

               It was supposed to erupt.

               I find the whole thing very embarrassing.

               it's in the

                             KRAMER
               When do you pit the sauce on?

               
                             ELAINE
               Any other time.

               
                             KRAMER

                             ELAINE
               What are you doing? What is all this?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. 
               I'm being audited.
 
               
                             ELAINE

                             JERRY
               Oh, I contributed money to a charity 
               that turned out to be fraudulent. It's 
               very
 
               
               boring.

                             ELAINE
               Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that 
               that was ...
 
               
                             JERRY
               Something to drink?

               
                             ELAINE
               What did you think, that would impress

                             JERRY
               You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking 
               only of the poor Krakatoans
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Like you this donation for 50 bucks 
               and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. 
               who sacrifice so much for so long.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE

                             JERRY
               No, that's Krama.

                             JERRY
               It's all taken care of.

               placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak,

                             JERRY
               ... if this audit had happened to me 
               and I didn't have this woman to help
 
               
               
               me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life 
               out of him
 
               
               with my bare hands

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't blame ya'

               
                             JERRY
               Have you ever been through an audit?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               It's hell. It's the financial equivalent 
               of a complete rectal
 
               
               examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from 
               limb, ripped the
 
               
               flesh right off his bones ...

               
               (buzzer)

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah

               
                             GEORGE
               George

               
                             JERRY
               Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, 
               George Louis Costanza. Here I am about 
               to go
 
               
               to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               My whole life has been a complete waste 
               of time, (chuckle)
 
               
                             JERRY
               And there's so much more to go.

               
                             GEORGE
               Now I know what I am supposed to do. 
               It's so simple.
 
               
               Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth

               
                             JERRY
               So what happened? You gave her my tax 
               papers? ... My papers?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, oh, your papers

               
                             JERRY
               What happened you didn't give her the 
               papers?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No. I did.

               
                             JERRY
               SO?

               
                             GEORGE
               ...I broke up with her.

               
               (Kramer leaves)

               
                             JERRY
               You what?

               
                             GEORGE
               I broke up with her.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm being audited! And you broke up 
               with her?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm 
               sure she'll still do it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Why will she still do it? She hates 
               you now. People don't do you favors 
               after you dump
 
               
               them.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, no. We left on good terms.

               
                             JERRY
               How is that possible?

               
                             GEORGE
               Because I uh, I told her the truth.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, my God.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's OK.

               
                             JERRY
               It's unheard of ...

               
                             GEORGE
               She asked me to.

               
                             JERRY
               So you lie! What did you tell her?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I told her that she was pretentious.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. 
               You told her she was
 
               
               pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything 
               they
 
               
               want

               
                             ELAINE
               How would you like it if someone told 
               YOU the truth?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Like what? What could they say?

               
                             ELAINE
               There are plenty of things to say.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? 
               Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               George, please.

               
                             GEORGE
               Give me one.

               
                             ELAINE
               You sure?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes.

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             ELAINE
               Forget it. You are very careful with 
               money.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How 
               could you say that to me? I can't
 
               
               
               believe this. How could you say that to me?

               
                             ELAINE
               You asked me to.

               
                             GEORGE
               You should have lied.

               
                             ELAINE
               HUH, so should you.

               
                             JERRY
               OK, wait a second, wait a second, what 
               happened to my papers?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really 
               working right now.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I know.

               
                             GEORGE
               When I was working I spent baby.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. 
               WHAT happened to the papers?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               She put them in her pocketbook. I guess 
               she took them with her.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Pocketbook or a handbag?

               
                             JERRY
               Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call 
               her office.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I 
               would like to speak to Patrice. ...
 
               
               
               what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)

               
                             JERRY
               What? What?

               
                             GEORGE
               She never came back from lunch.

               
                             JERRY
               This is no good. This is no good. Call 
               her house.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, 
               (hangs up) She hung up.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Not good.

               
                             GEORGE
               All right. There's nothing to be worried 
               about. She's just a little
 
               
               annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll 
               apologize.
 
               
               I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)

               
                             JERRY
               Not good

               Yeah, it's a windshield.

               
                             JERRY
               I can see that. What's it for?

               
                             KRAMER
               I found it on the road.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah (to buzzer)

               
                             ELAINE
               (from intercom) I just finished working 
               out are you busy?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Come on up.

               
                             KRAMER
               Can you believe somebody threw this 
               out? You know I'm going to make a
 
               
               
               coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.

               
                             JERRY
               wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, 
               are you going to just sense it's
 
               
               in front of the couch?

               
                             KRAMER
               wow

                             ELAINE
               hell-oo

                             JERRY
               What's with you two?

               
                             ELAINE
               You haven't told him?

               
                             JERRY
               Tell me what?

               
                             ELAINE
               Huh, go ahead, tell him.

               
                             KRAMER
               I, I saw her naked.

               
                             ELAINE
               He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me 
               naked.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Who walks into a woman's bedroom without 
               knocking. I want to know!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I thought it was a closet.

               
                             JERRY
               Completely naked?

               
                             KRAMER
               Completely naked.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerrryyy, How can I go on?

               
                             KRAMER
               All right. I'll tell you what. If it's 
               going to make you feel any better you 
               can see me naked.
 
               
               (Kramer begins disrobing)

               
                             ELAINE
               No thanks!

               
                             KRAMER
               No, I want you to see me naked.

               
                             ELAINE
               No, no no.

               
                             KRAMER
               No, I want to show you.

               
                             ELAINE
               No! Jerry! Jerry!

               
                             JERRY
               OK, just a second lets not lose our 
               heads here. Kramer you know you are 
               always welcome in my
 
               
               home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
 
               
               
               (Kramer sits down picks up windshield)

               
                             ELAINE
               Ehat is this?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, it's a windshield. It's going 
               to be your new coffee table.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that 
               thiing. You can't even see it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You'll sense it.

               
               (George enters slowly)

               
                             JERRY
               Well, what happened? Was she there?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, no she wasn't.

               
                             JERRY
               You didn't get my papers?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, I didn't.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, where is she?

               
                             GEORGE
               A mental institution.

               
               STAND UP ROUTINE

               
               
               
               Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because 
               when you have
 
               
               clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments 
               that people like
 
               
               to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah 
               pretty good
 
               
               (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But 
               when you're
 
               
               naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) 
               There's
 
               
               nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when 
               I'm naked. Cause I
 
               
               feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging 
               and
 
               
               lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that 
               would be,
 
               
               wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able 
               to do this (hand
 
               
               in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.

                             KRAMER
               You know what they do in there? Did 
               you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those 
               electrodes in
 
               
               your head.

               
                             GEORGE
               It's not really a mental institution. 
               It's more like a depression
 
               
               clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, 
               I'm sick over
 
               
               this.

               Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism 
               before but never to a mental institution.

               My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. 
               But his synapses were so large, it had 
               no effect.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know I hate to raise a crass financial 
               concern but was there any
 
               
               information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!

               
                             GEORGE
               She put them in her pocket book. She 
               probably took them out there with her.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So what now?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know.

               
                             JERRY
               Can we go out there?

               I'm very nervous about this. I've never 
               spoken to a mental patient before.

               My cousin Douglas was in a place like 
               this one time . He came over to
 
               
               my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He 
               was screamin'

               I should be in a place like this I envy 
               this woman. Ya' get to wear
 
               
               slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very 
               underrated. I
 
               
               like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association
 
               
               
               tests. I love those.

               pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS

               institution.

               You're just trying to take it all back 
               because you're feeling guilty I'm in 
               here.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No, that's not it at all.

               
                             PATRICE
               Don't LIE George.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'M NOT A LIER!

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to 
               security attendent)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Just chatting. Friendly.

               
                             GEORGE
               All righty, no reason for us to uh, 
               raise our voices.
 
               
                             PATRICE
               I know what you said. You can't change 
               that.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What I said? I saw stupid things all 
               the time I can't go two minutes without 
               saying stupid things.
 
               
                             JERRY
               It's one stupid thing after another. 
               So let me ask you, when you come to 
               one of these places,
 
               
               what do you bring your pocketbook?

               
                             GEORGE
               You should be the one criticizing me. 
               I, I'm lucky to even know someone like 
               you.
 
               
                             PATRICE
               You mean that?

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course I mean that. I am incapable 
               of guile.
 
               
                             JERRY
               He's never guiled. You know some women 
               keep a lot of important papers in their, 
               uh, pocket book.
 
               
               Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
 
               
               
                             PATRICE
               Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome 
               with the tax problem. You know after 
               that day with George I
 
               
               got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help 
               you but I'll need the copies.
 
               
                             JERRY
               there are no copies.

               
                             PATRICE
               So are you saying you want to continue 
               seeing me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Who makes copies?

               a very nice couple.

               of a receipt for a computer thatI bought 
               there....
 
               
               it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a 
               maroon sport jacket - and he might
 
               
               have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come 
               bye ok, bye.

               Anybody want to take a walk down to 
               48th street? I think I may have tracked 
               down another receipt.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I can't. I have to go visit Tina in 
               the hospital.
 
               
                             JERRY

               I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: 
               First time poets, in a burnt out building, 
               down by the docks,

               All right, great, great uh, we'll share

                             JERRY
               You're going by 48th St. You can give 
               me a ride.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, I'm getting in on that.

               
                             ELAINE
               You know you're chippin' in.

               
                             GEORGE
               You're going that way anyway!

               I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds 
               like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun
               about it, you know. 
               
               But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything 
               to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take
               all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake
               and just kinda crank it around there.

               You know give me a feeling like you might win something. 
               You know what I               
               mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm 
               sorry that's           
               another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting 
               gifts for you. Jail!"
