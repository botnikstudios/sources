               (Comedy club)

               
               To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and 
               they're
 
               working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape 
               but the
 
               strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. 
               The only
 
               reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through 
               the
 
               workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for 
               when we have
 
               to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing 
               I don't get
 
               about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty 
               towels and
 
               smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these 
               disgusting gym
 
               clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt 
               because he
 
               has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't 
               even think
 
               about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of 
               these locks
 
               you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff 
               is safe.

                             KRAMER
               Wide open, I was wide open underneath! 
               I had three inches on that
 
               guy. You two were hogging the ball.

               
                             GEORGE
               Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the 
               ball. All you do is dribble.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I have to dribble, if I give it to you, 
               you just shoot. You're a
 
               chucker.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh I'm a chucker.

               
                             JERRY
               That's right, everytime you get the 
               ball you shoot.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't believe you called me a chucker. 
               No way I'm a chucker, I do
 
               not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, 
               no chuck!
 
               
                             JERRY
               You chuck.

               
                             GEROGE
               Kramer am I a chucker?

               
               
                             KRAMER
               You're a chucker.

               
                             GEORGE
               All these years I've been chuckin' and 
               you've never told me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well it's not an easy thing to bring 
               up.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Hey you know this is the first time 
               we've ever seen each other naked.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Believe me I didn't see anything.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?

               
                             JERRY
               No, did you?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, I snuck a peak.

               
                             JERRY
               Why?

               
                             KRAMER
               Why not? hey what about you George?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But 
               it was so fast I didn't see
 
               anything. It was just a blur.

               
                             JERRY
               I made a conscious effort not to look. 
               There's certain information I just
 
               
               don't want to have.

               
                             KRAMER
               Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. 
               I'll see you later.
 
               
                             JERRY
               All right

               
                             KRAMER
               Have a good one.

               
                             JERRY
               All right

               
                             GEORGE
               See ya.

               
               (Kramer exits)

               
                             GEORGE
               look at this guy. Does he have to stretch 
               in here?
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know who that is? That's

               
                             GEORGE
               Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, that's him.

               
                             GEORGE
               Are you sure?

               
                             JERRY
               Positive.

               
                             GEORGE
               Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great 
               player.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's 
               a Civil War buff.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... 
               What do you have to do to be a buff
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well 
               sleeping less than 18 hours a day
 
               
               would be a start.

               
                             GEORGE
               ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two 
               weeks left of unemployment. I got
 
               
               to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, should we say something to him?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from 
               fans in the locker room.
 
               
                             JERRY
               well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't 
               mind.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So?

               
                             GEORGE
               What are you comparing yourself to Keith 
               Hernandez. The guys a baseball
 
               player Jerry, Baseball!

               
                             JERRY
               I know what he is. I recognized him. 
               You didn't even notice him.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What, ... you are making some wisecracks 
               in a night club... wo wo wo.
 
               The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
 
               
               
                             KEITH
               Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, 
               I'm Keith Hernandez and I just
 
               want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

               
                             JERRY
               Really?

               
                             KEITH
               I've always wanted to do what you do.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What I do? You are one of my favorite 
               ball players of all time
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Mine too.

               
                             KEITH
               I love that bit about Jimmy Olson

               
                             JERRY
               Thank you.

               
                             GEORGE
               You know Keith, what I've always wondered, 
               with all these ball clubs
 
               flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane 
               crash? ...
 
               
                             KEITH
               (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in 
               new York right now?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm performing in this club on the east 
               Side. You should come in.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               But if you think about it...26 teams, 
               162 games a season, you'd think
 
               eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

               
                             KEITH
               You know, I live on the East Side.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I'll tell you what, I'll give you my 
               number and uh, just give me a call,
 
               
               tell me whenever you want to go.

               
                             KEITH
               or maybe just to get together for a 
               cup of coffee
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh. that would be great.

               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, it's only a matter of time.

               
                             KEITH
               Who's this chucker?

               
               ---

               
               (Monks)

               
                             JERRY
               It's been three days and he hasn't called.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Well maybe you should call him.

               
                             JERRY
               I can't ... I can't

               
                             ELAINE
               Why not?

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. I just feel he should 
               call me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What's the difference?

               
                             JERRY
               You don't understand, Elaine. I don't 
               want to be overanxious. If he wants
 
               
               to see me he has my number, he should call.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I can't stand these guys. You give your 
               number to them and then they
 
               don't call. Why do they do that?

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sorry honey.

               
                             JERRY
               I mean, I thought he liked me. I really 
               thought he liked me. we were
 
               getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.

               
                             ELAINE
               No,

               
                             JERRY
               Why did he come over to me if he didn't 
               want to see me?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I know.

               
                             JERRY
               What did he come over to me if he didn't

               Sometimes I've given my number out to 
               guys and it takes them a month to
 
               
               call.

               
                             JERRY
               Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling 
               in a month he's got a prayer!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe 
               he's been out of town?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, they don't have phones out of town? 
               Why do(?) people say they're
 
               too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How 
               can you be
 
               too busy?

               
                             ELAINE
               Why don't you just go ahead and call 
               him?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. 
               I mean what am I going to say to
 
               him?

               
                             ELAINE
               Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
 
               
               
                             JERRY

                             ELAINE
               Dinner's good.

               
                             JERRY
               Don't you think that's coming on a little 
               too strong? .. Isn't that like
 
               a turn off?

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, He's A GUY!

               When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. 
               Whatever the
 
               group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're 
               not
 
               interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not 
               interested in
 
               seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't 
               know the food.
 
               They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on 
               the gym or
 
               someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have 
               a lot of
 
               potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when 
               you're a kid,
 
               you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little 
               kid what were
 
               the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's 
               my friend,
 
               they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! 
               Come on in. Jump
 
               up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at 
               all, You like
 
               Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!

               it won't be a baby anymore
 
               then you wouldn't have to see it.

               Hellooo Newman.

               
                             KRAMER
               I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               I despise him.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Why? I'll tell you why...

               
                             KRAMER
               Let me tell it ..

               
                             NEWMAN
               No, you can't tell it ..

               
                             KRAMER
               You always tell it ..

               
                             NEWMAN
               All right, tell it.

               
                             KRAMER
               Ja ja ja - just tell it

               
                             NEWMAN
               June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're 
               enjoying a beautiful afternoon
 
               in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a 
               five run Phillies
 
               ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

               
                             KRAMER
               Our day was ruined. There was a lot 
               of people, you know, they were
 
               waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the 
               ramp ... (cut
 
               to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella 
               man and
 
               everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!) ... Newman was in front 
               of me. Keith
 
               was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice 
               game pretty
 
               boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.

               
                             NEWMAN
               A second later, something happened that 
               changed us in a deep and
 
               profound way front that day forward.

               
                             ELAINE
               What was it?

               
                             KRAMER
               He spit on us.... and I screamed out, 
               "I'm hit!"
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Then I turned and the spit ricochet 
               of him and it hit me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Wow! What a story.

               
                             JERRY
               Unfortunately the immutable laws of 
               physics contradict the whole premise
 
               
               of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss 
               Benes as
 
               I've heard this story a number of times.

               
                             JERRY
               Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. 
               According to your story Keith
 
               passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were 
               struck on
 
               the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the 
               temple
 
               striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then 
               cam off
 
               the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him 
               to drop his
 
               baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In 
               mid air
 
               mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. 
               That is one
 
               magic luggie.

               
               (THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF 
               KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM SCENE IN
 
               THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!)
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               Well that's the way it happened.

               
                             JERRY
               What happened to your head when you 
               got hit?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well. uh, well my head went back and 
               to the left
 
               
                             JERRY
               Again

               
                             KRAMER
               Back and to the left

               
                             JERRY
               Back and to the left Back and to the 
               left
 
               
                             ELAINE
               So, what are you saying?

               
                             JERRY
               I am saying that the spit could not 
               have come from behind ... that there 
               had to have been
 
               a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the 
               spitter was behind you as you claimed
 
               that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

               
                             ELAINE
               So the spit could have only come from 
               the front and to the right.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But that is not what they would have 
               you believe.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Wait, wait, (Exits)

               
                             JERRY
               The sad thing is we may never know the 
               real truth.
 
               
               (George runs in)

               
                             GEORGE
               (Frantically) Did anybody call here 
               asking for Vandaley industries?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No. What happened to you?

               
                             GEORGE
               Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment 
               office and I told them that I was very 
               close
 
               to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your 
               phone number. So, when now when the phone
 
               rings you've got to answer "Vanadaley Industries".

               
                             JERRY
               I'm Vanadaley Industries?

               
                             GEORGE
               Right.

               
                             JERRY
               And what is that?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're in latex

               
                             JERRY
               Latex? And what do I do with latex?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Ya manufacture it.

               
                             ELAINE
               Here in this little apartment?

               
                             JERRY
               And what do I say about you?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're considering hiring me for your 
               latex salesman.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Right.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't think so. Why would I do that?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Because I asked you to.

               
                             JERRY
               If you think I'm looking for someone 
               to just sit at a desk pushing papers
 
               
               around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying 
               to
 
               manufacture the stuff.

               
               (Buzzer)

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah.

                             JERRY

               out the past five years.

               Friday night.
 
               
                             GEORGE
