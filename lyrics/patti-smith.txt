
Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Meltin' in a pot of thieves
Wild card up my sleeve
Thick heart of stone
My sins my own
They belong to me, me

People say "beware!"
But I don't care
The words are just
Rules and regulations to me, me

I-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud
I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed
And I go to this here party and I just get bored
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
Ooh I'll put my spell on her

Here she comes
Walkin' down the street
Here she comes
Comin' through my door
Here she comes
Crawlin' up my stair
Here she comes
Waltzin' through the hall
In a pretty red dress
And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine

And then I hear this knockin' on my door
Hear this knockin' on my door
And I look up into the big tower clock
And say, "oh my God here's midnight!"
And my baby is walkin' through the door
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine
And I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine

And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria

I was at the stadium
There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me
Marie and Ruth but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
Counting the time, then you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh. you were so good, oh, you were so fine
And I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine
Make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine

G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria

And the tower bells chime, "ding dong" they chime
They're singing, "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine."

Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A,
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A, G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria.


Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel that sent you away.
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Called you on the phone, another dimension.
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Women all standing with a shock on their faces.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.

Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad.
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Pretty little girl, everyone cried.
She was the victim of sweet suicide.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Women all standing with shock on their faces.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.

Desk clerk told me girl was washed up,
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Picked up my key, didn't reply.
Went to my room, started to cry.
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal.
I was just standing with shock on my face.
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you.
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye.


His father died and left him a little farm in New England.
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night.
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.

And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
“No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you're not human, you are not human.”

But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,
“I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.”

I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
So he cried out as he stretched the sky,
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
And he put up his hands and he said, “It's me, it's me,
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,
Don't let me here,” the son, the sign, the cross,
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
No longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer
Take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,
I'm going up, I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Where we are not human, we're not human.

Well, there was sand, there were tiles,
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated
Like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface
He saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot
And he saw raven comin' in
And he crawled on his back and he went up
Up up up up up up
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
We like birdland.


Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery,
Scoop the pearls up from the sea
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need.

Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.
I take that money, buy you things you never had.

Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,
Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream
And take you through the stratosphere
And check out the planets there and then take you down
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,
Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money.

Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery.
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.

Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone.
Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone
If we dream, dream, dream for free.
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,
Free money, free money, free money, [X7]
Free money, free money, free money, free.


The wall is high, the black barn,
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift,
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.

Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me.
Oh baby, I remember when you were born,
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash
And the sky split and the planets hit,
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.

I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.
Your soul was like a network of spittle,
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,
And I prayed as the lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack,
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack.

The palm trees fall into the sea,
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly.
And I can gaze deep
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, oh.

Oh, in your starry eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.

Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby


Car stopped in a clearing,
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
He cried, "Break it up, oh I don't understand,
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
I'm not listening."

Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, "Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me."

The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, "Take me please!"

Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, "Break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel." 

So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.
Break it up, break it up, break it up,
Break it up, break it up, break it up,
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up, break it on up
Break it up, break it on up, up, up
Break it, break it, break it, break it
Break it on up, break it up,
Break it up, break it up, break it up ...


The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway

The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
but the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started laughing hysterically

When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
horses, horses, horses, horses
coming in in all directions
white shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi

Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, “Oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender?”
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi

There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
the sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire

I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
that's how I
I died
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
[Everything on the current] moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land

looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
that went streaming through the sands like fingers,
like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
(His fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
and go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter

In the sheets
there was a man
dancing around
to the simple
Rock & roll
song


I just don't know what to do tonight,
My head is aching as I drink and breathe
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.

There must be something I can dream tonight,
The air is filled with the moves of you,
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.

Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad
That our friends can't be with us today.


Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee
Ask the angels while they're falling
Who that person could possibly be

And I know you got the feeling,
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor
And I know it got you reelin'
And honey honey the call is for war
And it's wild wild wild wild.

Everybody got the feelin'
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day
Everybody wants to be reelin'
And baby baby I'll show you the way

And I know it's hard sometimes,
You got a piece and hit across the sky
And I know it's hard sometimes
And world war is the battle cry
And it's wild wild wild wild

Across the country through the fields
You know I see it written 'cross the sky
People rising from the highway
And war war is the battle cry
And it's wild wild wild wild.

Armageddon, it's gotten
No savior jailer can take it from me
World ending, it's just beginning
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be
And it's wild wild wild wild
Wild wild wild wild [X3]

Ask the angels if they're startin' to move
Comin' in droves in from L.A.
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove
Lightning as armor and it's today
It's wild wild wild wild
Wild wild wild wild [X3]


Down in Vineland there's a clubhouse,
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff

Do you not go to the palace of answers with me Marie?
Oh no, I don't think so, no
See when they offer me book of gold,
I know soon still that platinum is coming
And when I look inside of your temple
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Well, I move in another direction,
I move in another dimension

I spin, I spiral, and I splatter
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
Hand of God, and I start to whirl
And I whirl, and I whirl,

Go, go on, go like a dervish,

He's delighted to love me, but you know,
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know.

Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah Baby got it but baby want more
She won't need it any more (babble)
Although she was tense and lean in the sun Splintered like a country
Gently pulled his finger
Everything is soakin' and spread with butter
Their flowers on an average (on the seed?)

And then they laid her on the table
She connected with the inhaler
And the needle shiftin' like crazy,
She was, she was completely still.
It was like a painting of a vase,
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast
Through the dorsal spine and down and around
(I want more)
The anal cavity, her cranium
(I wanna score)
Just, it was really great, man,
The gas had inflicted her entire spine
With the elements of a voluptuous disease
With a green vapor, made her feet light

Baby want more

Baby was it in the closet.
Baby get it there, baby tag it,
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby

I don't think (after station) there's any station
(I remember when)
Quite as interesting to me
(baby worship something)
As the 12th station
(laughin' at the flowers)
I tuned in (to the tower) too many centuries
Were calling to me
And I spin, come down thru time
Oh, watch them say you're too high

And I swim through

Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio,
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio
(babble)
one long ecstatic pure sensation
restriction started excreting, started excreting, ah exhilarating
bottomless pit

Hey Sheba, hey Salome, hey Venus eclipsin' my way ah.
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic.
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning


Pissing in a river, watching it rise
Tattoo fingers shy away from me
Voices voices mesmerize
Voices voices beckoning sea
Come come come come back come back
Come back come back come back

Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon
Mouth of a cave, I'm a slave I'm free.
When are you coming ? Hope you come soon
Fingers, fingers encircling thee
Come come come come come come
Come come come come come come for me oh

My bowels are empty, excreting your soul
What more can I give you? Baby I don't know
What more can I give you to make this thing grow?
Don't turn your back now, I'm talking to you

Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Should I go the length of a river
(The royal, the throne, the cry me a river)
Everything I've done, I've done for you
Oh I give my life for you.
Every move I made I move to you,
And I came like a magnet for you now.

What about it, you're gonna leave me,
What about it, you don't need me,
What about it, I can't live without you,
What about it, I never doubted you
What about it? What about it?
What about it? What about it?

Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Should I go the length of a river,
(The royal, the throne, the cry me a river)
What about it, what about it, what about it?
Oh, I'm pissing in a river.


Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,

Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.
Total abandon, ooh wah

Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
Got no recollection of my past reflection,
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping

Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,
Coming in the garden, got a conscious stream,
Coming in a washroom, coming on a plane,
Coming in a force field, coming in my brain
And my heart, my heart,
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Total abandon

Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain,
My heart Oh


When, when will you be landing?
When, when will you return?
Feel, feel my heart expanding
You and your alien arms

All my earthly dreams are shattered,
I'm so tired I quit
Take me forever, it doesn't matter
Deep inside of your ship.

La, la la la la la landing.
Please, oh oh won't you return?
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,
You and your alien arms

Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you
Oh you know, I would go anywhere at all
'Cause no star is too far with you, with you

La, la la la la la landing.
Please, oh oh won't you return?
Feel, feel my heart expanding,
You and your alien arms

All my earthly dreams are shattered,
I'm so tired I quit
Take me forever, it doesn't matter
Deep inside of your ship
Land, land

Oh I am waiting for you,
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,
Oh I am waiting for you


Oh I'll send you a telegram
Oh I have some information for you
Oh I'll send you a telegram
Send it deep in the heart of you
Deep in the heart of your brain is a lever
Oh deep in the heart of your brain is a switch
Oh deep in the heart of your flesh you are clever
Oh honey you met your match in a bitch

Deep in the heart of

There will be no famine in my existence
I merge with the people of the hills
Oh people of Ethiopia
Your opiate is the air that you breathe
All those mint bushes around you
Are the perfect thing for your system
Aww clean clean it out
You must rid yourself from these, these animal fixations
You must release yourself
From the thickening blackmail of elephantiasis
You must divide the wheat from the rats
You must turn around (and look oh God)

When I see Brancusi
His eyes searching out the infinite abstract spaces
In the (radio) rude hands of sculptor

Raise the sky.
We got to fly over the land, over the sea.
Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise.
God, do not seize me please, till victory.

Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame
No one to bow to, to vow to, to blame.
Legions of light, virtuous flight. Ignite, excite.

And you will see us coming, V formation, through the sky.
Film survives. Eyes cry.
On the hill, hear us call through a realm of sound.
Oh, oh-oh. Down and down.
Down and round, oh, down and round.
Round and round, oh, round and round.

Rend the veil and we shall sail.
The nail, the grail: That's all behind thee.
In deed, in creed, the curve of our speed.
And we believe that we will raise the sky.
We got to fly over the land, over the sea.
Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise.
God, do not seize me please, till victory.

Victory. Till victory. [repeat]


Blood on the T.V., ten o'clock news.
Souls are invaded, heart in a groove.
Beatin' and beatin' so outta time.
What's the mad matter with the church chimes?
Here comes a stranger up on Ninth Avenue.
Leanin' green tower, indiscreet view.
Over the cloud, over the bridge,
sensitive muscle, sensitive ridge of my
space monkey. Sign of the time-time
Space monkey, so outta line-line.
Space monkey, sort of divine.
And he's mine, mine, all mine.

Pierre Clementi, snot full o' cocaine.
The sexual streets, why it's all so insane.
Humans are running, lavender room.
Hoverin' liquid, move over moon for my
space monkey. Sign of the time-time
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine
Space monkey, so out of line and he's mine, mine, oh he's mine

[Spoken]
A stranger comes up to him; hands him an old, rusty Polaroid.
It starts crumbling in his hands.
He says, "Oh man, I don't get the picture. This is no picture.
This is just...this just-a...this just-a...
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack-knife.
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack." (shriek)

Rude excavation, landin' site.
Boy hesitatin', jack-knife.
He rips his leg open, so out of time.
Blood and light runnin'. It's all like a dream.
Light of my life, he's dressed in flame.
It's all so predestined. It's all such a game for my
space monkey. Sign of the time-time.
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine.
Space monkey, so out of line and it's all just space, just space.

There he is, up in a tree.
Oh, I hear him callin' down to me.
That banana-shaped object ain't no banana.
It's a bright, yellow U.F.O.
And he's coming to get me. Here I go.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up ,up, up ...
Oh, goodbye mama. I'll never do dishes again.
Here I go from my body.
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Help!


Take me now baby here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now,
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers ...

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers ...

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight there are two lovers ...


We shall live again, we shall live.

What is it children that falls from the sky?
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye aye.
Mannah from Heaven from the most high,
Food from the father, tayi, taye aye.

We shall live again, we shall live again,
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.

Peace to your brother, give and take peace,
Tayi, taya, it leaves two feet
One foot extended, snake to the ground,
Wave up the Earth, one turn around.

We shall live again, we shall live again,
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.

Stretch out your arms now tip and swing,
Rude up thy bird, tayi, tayi.
Threw out your shoe over the soil,
Dust off the words that shaped from the tale.

We shall live again, we shall live again,
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.

Here we are, Father, Lord, Holy Ghost,
Bread of your bread, ghost of your host,
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,
Word of your word, cry of your cry.

We shall live again, we shall live again,
We shall live again.

What is it, Father, in your eye,
What is this wisdom, eyes of God,
That makes me feel just what I need.
You used to fly me the way to speed.

What is it, Father, holy that night?
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?
What is it, Father, that is waiting in Heaven?
What is it, Father, that shapes from your hand?
What is it, Father, that makes me spin around?
What is it, Father, that brings me down
What is it, Father, you can't tell what I like.
What is it, Father, I just ride into space
What is it, Father, I can tell you one night
What is it, Father, I can tell what I like
What is it, Father, are you into shape
What is it, Father, are you calling today
What is it, Father ... [?]


I haven't fucked much with the past, 
But I've fucked plenty with the future. 
Over the skin of silk are scars 
From the splinters of stations 
And walls I've caressed. 

A stage is like each bolt of wood, 
Like a log of Helen, is my pleasure. 
I would measure the success of a night 
By the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed 
I could exude over the columns that nestled the P.A. 

Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off 
With a skirt of green net sewed over 
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed. 
The lights were violet and white. 
I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it. 

When my hair was cropped, I craved covering, 
But now my hair itself is a veil, 
And the scalp inside is a scalp of 
A crazy and sleepy Comanche 
Lies beneath this netting of the skin. 

I wake up. I am lying peacefully 
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun. 
I desire him, and he is absolutely ready to seize me. 
In heart I am a Moslem; 
In heart I am an American; 
In heart I am Moslem, 
In heart I'm an American artist, 
And I have no guilt. 

I seek pleasure. 
I seek the nerves under your skin. 
The narrow archway; the layers; 
The scroll of ancient lettuce. 

We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly, 
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore. 
He spared the child and spoiled the rod. 
I have not sold myself to God.


Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
Baby got big and baby get bigger.
Baby get something. Baby get more.
Baby, baby, baby was a rock-and-roll nigger.
Oh, look around you, all around you,
riding on a copper wave.
Do you like the world around you?
Are you ready to behave?

Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society, that's where I want to be.

(Lenny!)

Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
You know she got big. Well, she's gonna get bigger.
Baby got a hand; got a finger on the trigger.
Baby, baby, baby is a rock-and-roll nigger.

Outside of society, that's where I want to be.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.

(Those who have suffered, understand suffering,
and thereby extend their hand
the storm that brings harm
also makes fertile
blessed is the grass
and herb and the true thorn and light)

I was lost in a valley of pleasure.
I was lost in the infinite sea.
I was lost, and measure for measure,
love spewed from the heart of me.
I was lost, and the cost,
and the cost didn't matter to me.
I was lost, and the cost
was to be outside society.

Jimi Hendrix was a nigger.
Jesus Christ and Grandma, too.
Jackson Pollock was a nigger.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,
nigger, nigger, nigger.

Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society, if you're looking,
that's where you'll find me.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society. [Repeat]


I see it all before me:
the days of love and torment;
the nights of rock-and-roll.
I see it all before me.
Sometimes my spirit's empty;
don't have the will to go on.
I wish someone would send me energy.

Give me something.
Give me something to give.
Oh, God, give me something:
a reason to live.
My body is aching.
Don't want sympathy.
Come on. Come and love me.
Come on. Set me free.
Set me free.

The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me through the path of righteousness for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

Hey, Lord, I'm waitin' for you.
Oh, God, I'm waitin' for you;
waitin' to open Your ninety-eight wounds
and be Thee, be Thee.
Lead me, oh, lead me.

Leave me something.
Leave me something to live.
Oh, God, give me something:
a reason to live.
I don't want no handout;
no, not sympathy.
Come on. Come and love me.
Come on. Set me free.
Set me free.
Come on. Set me free
Set me free ...

Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn.
Set me free.

In the presence of my enemies,
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn.
Here I am.


(Every Sunday I will go down to the bar
and leave him the guitar.)

You say you want me.
I want another.
Say you dream of me.
Dream of your brother.
Oh, the stars shine so suspiciously
for we three.

You said when you were with me that nothing made you high.
We drank all night together and you began to cry so recklessly.
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me.

You say you want me.
I want another, baby.
You say you wish for me.
Wish for your brother.
Oh, the dice roll so deceptively
for we three.

It was just another Saturday
and ev'rything was in the key of A.
And I lit a cigarette for your brother.
And he turned and heard me say so desp'rately,
"Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me."

You say you want me.
I want another.
You say you pray for me.
Pray for your brother.
Oh, the way that I see him is the way I see myself.
So please stand back now and let time tell you.
Oh, can't you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny
of we three?

Every night on sep'rate stars, before we go to sleep, we pray so breathlessly.
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me.


We explore the men's room.
We don't give a shit.
Ladies' lost electricity;
Take vows inside of it.

Desire to dance;
Too startled to try.
Wrap my legs 'round you,
Starting to fly.

Let's explore
Up there, up there, up there,
On the twenty-fifth floor.

Circle all around me,
Coming for the kill, kill, kill
Oh kill me baby
Like a kamikaze
Heading for a spill.
Oh but it's all spilt milk to me.

Desire to dance;
Too startled to try.
Wrap my legs 'round you,
Starting to fly.

Let's soar
Up there, up there, up there,
On the twenty-fifth floor.

We do not eat
Flower of creation.
We do not eat,
Eat anything at all.
Love is, love was, love is a manifestation.
I'm waiting for a contact to call.
Love's war. Love's cruel.
Love's pretty, love's pretty cruel tonight.
I'm waiting here to refuel.
I'm gonna make contact tonight.
Love in my heart.
The night to exploit.
Twenty-five stories over Detroit,
And there's more
Up there, up there, up there.

Stoned in space. zeus. christ. it has always been rock and so it is and so it shall be.
Within the context of neo rock we must open up our eyes and seize and rend the veil of smoke which man calls order.
Pollution is a necessary result of the inability of man to reform and transform waste.
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest pre-occupation of man. man being the chosen alloy,
He must be reconnected via shit, at all cost.
Inherent with(in) us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from the clay of man.
And to re-create from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold.

All must not be art. some art we must disintegrate.
Positive (anarchy must exist.)

Easter Sunday, we were walking.
Easter Sunday, we were talking.
Isabel, my little one, take my hand. Time has come.

Isabella, all is glowing.
Isabella, all is knowing.
And my heart, Isabella.
And my head, Isabella.

Frederick and Vitalie, savior dwells inside of thee.
Oh, the path leads to the sun. Brother, sister, time has come.

Isabella, all is glowing.
Isabella, all is knowing.
Isabella, we are dying.
Isabella, we are rising.

I am the spring, the holy ground,
the endless seed of mystery,
the thorn, the veil, the face of grace,
the brazen image, the thief of sleep,
the ambassador of dreams, the prince of peace.
I am the sword, the wound, the stain.
Scorned transfigured child of Cain.
I rend, I end, I return.
Again I am the salt, the bitter laugh.
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star,
the ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ
dying and drying as I rise tonight.

Isabella, we are rising.
Isabella, we are rising . . .


Hi hello
Wake from thy sleep
God has granted
Thy soul to keep
All of the power
And all of the gain
Is entwined
In a single
Name

Frederick
Name of care
Fast asleep
In a room somewhere
Guardian angels/up above
On the one I love.

I am calling
As the young thrush
Caught in the crest
Astonished tie death
On this night of wonder
On this night I know
I would give all
If you called
To say hello.

High! high!
Hey hey
Rejoin to me as
The light fades
My soul surrenders
In my glove
Take this message
My dove
To the one I love.


She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he

Here I go and I don't know why
I fell so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me...

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, who is chosen by she

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly,
Could it be he's taking over me...

[chorus]

She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she ...

Here I go and I don't know why,
I spin so ceaselessly,
'til I lose my sense of gravity...

[chorus]

(oh god I fell for you ...)

The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
Grave visitations
What is it that calls to us?
Why must we pray screaming?
Why must not death be redefined?
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms
And whirl on a pane of glass
An afixiation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree
The hands of he and the promise that she is blessed among women.

(oh god I fell for you ...)


So you want to be a rock & roll star
Well listen now to what I say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn how to play
And when hair's combed right
And your pants are tight
It's gonna be all right

With time you go downtown
To the agent man he won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
They're all waiting there
To sell plastic wares
And in a week or two if you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart

What you pay for these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game
You're a little insane
What you get is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are
You're a rock & roll star
Na na na na na...

Hey you. come here. get up.
Ah, this is the era where everybody creates.
Recognize my face?
They call me broken glass.
That's because of the sound [?]
[?]
What you pay for all these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game
You're a little insane.
Well you're a little insane
Oh a little insane
'cause the thing that you gain
Is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are
Don't forget who you are
Don't forget who you are
You're a rock & roll star


When I am troubled in the night
He comes to comfort me
He wills me through the darkness
And the empty child is free

To take His hand, His sacred heart
The heart that breaks the dawn, Amen
And when I think, I've had my fill
He fills me up again


I feel upset
Let's do some celebrating
Come on honey
Don't hesitate now

Needed you, you withdrew
I was so forsaken
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move
I believe I'll be taking my revenge
Sweet revenge

I thought you were some perfect read-out
Some digital delay had obscured
And it secured phased my view
Of the wicked hand you played

Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out
Run out, ah you better face it
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck
I do know how to replace it with revenge
Oh, sweet revenge

I gave you a wristwatch, baby
You wouldn't even give me the time of day
You want to know what makes me tick
Now it's me that's got precious little to say

For the ghosts of our love have dried, have died
There's no use faking it
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight
High time, I was taking my revenge
Sweet revenge
Revenge
Revenge

All the gold and silver
Couldn't measure up my love for you, it's so immaterial
I won't wait around if I was you you
[?] nobody gets anything

Nobody gets nothing
No [?], don't leave me no space in your little boat
You ain't gonna need no, you ain't gonna need no little boat
You are living on my time, my dear

Revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet sweet revenge


I was nothing. It didn't matter to me.
Ah, there were tags all over my sleeve.
There was water outside the windows
and children in the streets with rats with tags.

Ain't got a passport.
Ain't got my real name.
Ain't got a chance, sport, at fortune and fame.
And I walk these endless streets, won't you give me a lift.
A lift. A lift. On your citizen ship. 

They were rioting in Chicago, movement in L.A.
Sixty-eight it broke up the yardbirds.
We were broke as well.
Took it underground, M.C. borderline, up against the wall.
The wall. The wall.
Show your papers, boy.

Citizen ship we got mem'ries.
Stateless, they got shame.
Cast adrift from the citizen ship, 
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway.

Blind alley in New York City, in a foreign embrace.
If you're hungry you're not too particular about what you'll taste.
Men in uniform gave me vinegar, spoon of misery.
But what the hell, I fell, I fell.
It doesn't matter to me.

Citizen ship we got mem'ries
Citizen ship, we got pain.
Cast adrift from the citizen ship,
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway.

I was caught like a moth with its wings outta sync.
Cut the chord. Overboard. Just a refugee.
Lady liberty, lend a hand to me, I've been cast adrift.
Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift.

On the citizen ship we got mem'ries
Citizen ship, we got pain.
Lose your grip on the citizen ship,
you're cast, you're cast away.
On the citizen ship you got mem'ry.
Citizen ship you got pain.
Citizen ship you got identity.
A name. A name. A name... 

What's your name, son?
What's your name? ...
What's your name?

Nothing. I got nothing.
Jersey.
Give me your tired, your poor
Give me your huddled masses
your wartorn
Give me your wartorn and your
Lift up your unto me.
Ah, mythology.


I've got seven ways of going, seven wheres to be,
seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee.
Lord, I do extol Thee, for Thou has lifted me.
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity.
Oh, I was undulating in the lewd impostered night.
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right.

Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome.
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
lo I turned my neck toward home.
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
'til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light.

In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You.

As I move thru seven levels
As I move upon the slate
As I declare to you
The number of my moves
As I speculate the eighth
Seeking love without exception
A light upon the swarm
Seeking love without exception
A saint in any form.


Nodding tho the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground.
To and fro she's darning, and the land is weeping red and pale.
Weeping yarn from Algiers. Weeping yarn from Algiers.

Weaving tho the eyes are pale, what will rend will also mend.
The sifting cloth is binding, and the dream she weaves will never end.
For we're marching toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers.

Lullaby tho baby's gone. Lullaby a broken song.
Oh, the cradle was our call. When it rocked we carried on.
And we marched on toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers
We're still marching for Algiers. Marching, marching for Algiers.
Not to hail a barren sky. Sifting cloth is weeping red.
The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears we've shed.
In the sky a broken flag, children wave and raise their arms.
We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on.


Hi, hi, I was running after you for a long time
I, I was watching you for, actually, I've watched you for a long time
I like to watch you when you're walking back and forth on the beach
And the way you, the way your cloth looks, I like

I like to see the edges, the bottom of it get all wet
When you're walking near the water there
It's real nice to talk to you, I didn't
I, I, I, I, I, how are you? how are you?

I saw, I saw you from your balcony window and
And you were standing there, waving at everybody
It was really great because there was about a billion people there
But when I was waving to you, the way your face was, it was so

The way your face was, it made me feel exactly like we're
It's not that you were just waving to me
But that we were we were waving to each other
Really it was really wonderful, I really felt happy, It really made me happy

And I, I just wanted to thank you, because, you, you really, really
You made me, you made me feel good and oh I, it's nothing
I, I, well I'm just clumsy, yeah, no, it's just a band-aid, no, it's okay
Oh no, I'm always doing something's always happening to me
Yeah, well, I'll be seein' ya, goodbye, bye

Wave thou art pretty
Wave thou art high
Wave thou are music
Wave thou are white

Oh, Albino
Oh, Albino

Wave thou art high
Wave thou art pretty
Wave to the city
Wave

Goodbye, goodbye sir, goodbye papa


I was dreamin' in my dreamin'
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleepin' it was broken
But my dream it lingered near

In the form of shinin' valleys
Where the pure air recognized
Oh, and my senses newly opened
And I awakened to the cry

And the people have the power
To redeem the work of fools
From the meek the graces shower
It's decreed the people rule

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
Well, and the armies ceased advancin'
Because the people had their ear

And the shepherds [?] the soldiers
And they laid among the stars
Exchanging visions, layin' arms
To waste in the dust

In the form of shinin' valleys
Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
And I awakened to the cry

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

Where there were deserts, I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize

There is no leopard and the lamb
And lay together truly bound
Well I was hopin' in my hopin'
To recall what I had found

Well I was dreamin' in my dreamin'
God knows a pure view
As I lay down into my sleepin'
And I commit my dream with you

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

The power to dream, to rule
To wrestle the earth from fools
But it's decreed the people rule
But it's decreed the people rule

Listen, I believe everythin' we dream
Can come to pass through our union
We can turn the world around
We can turn the earth's revolution

We have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

The power to dream, to rule
To wrestle the earth from fools
But it's decreed the people rule
But it's decreed the people rule

We have the power
We have the power
People have the power
We have the power


Up there
There's a ball of fire
Some call it the spirit
Some call it the sun
Its energies are not for hire
It serves man 
It serves everyone
Down there where Jonah wails
in the healing water
in the ready depths
Twisting like silver swans
No line of death no boundaries

Up there
The eye is hollow
The eye is winking
The winds ablaze
Angels howling
The sphinx awakens
But what can she say
You'd be amazed

Down there
Your days are numbers
Nothing to fear
There will be trumpets
There will be silence
In the end the end
Will be here just here

Ahh the borders of heaven
Are zipped up tight tonight
The abstract streets
The lights like some switched on Mondrian
Cats like us are obsolete
Hey Man don't breathe on my feet
Thieves, poets we're inside out
And everybody's a soldier
Angels howl at those abstract lights
And the borders of heaven
Are zipped up tight tonight

Up there
There's a ball of fire
Some call it the spirit
Some call it the sun
Its energies are not for hire
It serves man
It serves everyone
The air we breathe
The flame of wisdom
The earth we grind
The beckoning sea
It's no mystery
Not sentimental
Ahh the equation
It's all elemental

The world is restless
Heaven in flux
Angels appear
From the bright storm
Out of the shadows
Up there, down there
But what can we say
Man's been forewarned

All communion is not holy
Even those that fall
They can prophet understanding
It's all for man
It's for everyone
It's up there, down there
Everywhere
Everywhere
Time for communion
Time for communion
Talking communion ...


Speak to me
Speak to me heart
I feel a needing
to bridge the clouds
Softly go
A way I wish to know
A way I wish to know

Oh you'll ride
Surely dance
In a ring
Backwards and forwards
Those who seek
feel the glow
A glow we will all know
A glow we will all know

On that day
Filled with grace
And the heart's communion
Steps we take
Steps we trace
Into the light of reunion

Paths that cross
will cross again
Paths that cross
will cross again

Speak to me
Speak to me shadow
I spin from the wheel
nothing at all
Save the need
the need to weave
A silk of souls
that whisper whisper
A silk of souls
that whispers to me

Speak to me heart
all things renew
hearts will mend
round the bend
Paths that cross
cross again
Paths that cross
will cross again

Rise up hold the reins
We'll meet again I don't know when
Hold tight bye bye
Paths that cross
will cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross again


Na na na na na
Na na na na na

I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through
Each way I turn
the sense of you surrounds
in every step I take
In all I do
Your thoughts your schemes
captivate my dreams
Everlasting, ever new

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you

Deep in my heart
How the presence of you shines
In a light to last a whole life through
I recall the wonder of it all
Each dream of life I'll share with you

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you

I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through
The hand above
turns those leaves of love
All and all a timeless view
Each dream of life
Flung from paradise
Everlasting, ever new

Dream of Life
Dream Of Life

In a room in Lebanon
they silently slept
They were dreaming crazy dreams
in foreign alphabet
Lucky young boys
cross on the main
The driver was approaching
the American zone
The waving of hands
The tiniest train
They never dreamed
they'd never wake again

Voice of the Swarm
We follow we fall
Some kneel for priests
Some wail at walls
Flag on a match head
God or the law
And they'll all go together
Where duty calls

United children
Child of Iran
Parallel prayers
Baseball Koran
I'll protect Mama
I'll lie awake
I'll die for Allah
In a holy war
I'll be a ranger
I'll guard the streams
I'll be a soldier
A sleeping Marine

[Refrain]

In the heart of the ancient
Ali smiles
In the soul of the desert
the sun blooms
Awake
into the glare of all out little wars
Who pray to return to salute
the coming and dying of the moon
Oh sleeping sun

Assassin in prayer
laid a compass deep
Exploding dawn
and himself as well
Their eyes for his eyes
Their breath for his breath
All to his end

And a room in Lebanon
Dust of scenes
Erase and blend
May the blanket of Kings
Cover them and him

Forgive them Father
They know not what they do
From the vast portals
of their consciousness
they're calling to you


Sun is rising on the water
Light is dancing again
Let's go under where the sun beams
Let's go under my friend

Are we sleeping
Are we dreaming
Are we dancing again
Is it heaven
Crack it open
and we'll slide down
its stream

We can hold on (I'm sure)
To the sea's foaming mane
It will serve us
We'll surface
and we'll plunge back again

Sun is rising on the water
Light is dancing like a flame
There's no burning where the sun beams
Oh it's such a lovely game

Does the sea dream (I'm sure)
We are here, we attend
We are bells on the shore
where the tolling suspends

Who will decide the shape of things
The shift of being
Who will perceive
When life is new
Shall we divide and become another
Who is due for gift upon gift
Who will decide
Shall we swim over and over
The curve of a wing
Its destination ever changing

Sun is rising on the water
Light is dancing like a flame
Let's go waltzing on the water
Let's go under again

Let's go under
Going under


In the medieval night
'Twas love's design
And the sky was open
like a Valentine
All the lacy lights
Where wishes fall
And like Shakespeare's child
I wished on them all

Ahh to be your destiny
was all that I pursued
I could see the sights
from the lofty heights
But my heart obscured the view

I was looking for you
Looking for you
What could I do
I was looking for you

Along the black river
The ambassador jewels
And you were reflected
in all that I saw
In the towers of gold
In the wheel and wing
Gripping my senses
like an ancient claim

Many is the time I knelt in the light
appealing to all that I know
Guide my eyes and steps
that I may find love true

[Refrain]

Come on darlin'
All that hearts desire
was written before us
In the medieval fire
It was love's design
In the glittering stars
Like Shakespeare's child
To be where you are

From the Portobello Road
To the Port of Marseilles
Where the dervish turns
Where the wild goats play

Looking for you
I was


Little blue dreamer go to sleep
Let's close our eyes and call the deep
slumbering land that just begins
When day is done and little dreamers spin

First take my hand now let it go
Little blue boy you're on your own
Little blue wings as those feet fly
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky

May your path be your own
But I'm with you
And each day you'll grow
He'll be there too
And someday when you go
We'll follow you
As you go, as you go

Little blue star that offers light
Little blue bird that offers flight
Little blue path where those feet fall
Little blue dreamer won't you dream it all

[Refrain]

And in your travels you will see
Warrior wings remember Daddy
And if a mama bird you see
Folding her wings will you remember me
As you go, as you go
As you go, as you go


Hey now man's own kin
we commend into the wind
grateful arms grateful limbs
grateful soul he's gone again

I have a winter's tale
how vagrant hearts relent prevail
sow their seed into the wind
seize the sky and they're gone again

fame is fleeting God is nigh
we raise our arms to him on night
we shoot our flint into the sun
we bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone

Hey now man's own kin
we commend into the wind
grateful arms grateful limbs
grateful heart he's gone again

Here a man man's own kin
he turned his back and his own people shot him
and he fell on his knees
before the burning plane
and he beheld fields of gold his land his sun
and he arose his blood aflame
the clouds pressed with hand prints stained

one last breath
the sky is high
the hungry earth
the empty vein
the ashes rain
death's own bed
man's own kin
into the wind
one last breath
hole in life
love knot tied
braid undone
child born
the hollow horn
warrior cried
a warrior died
one last breath
lick of flame
spirit moaned
spirit shed
the heavens fed
man's own kin
grips the sky
and he's gone again

Hey now man's own kin
we lay down into the wind
grateful arms grateful limbs
grateful heart he's gone again

Hey now man's own kin
he ascends into the wind
grateful heart grateful limbs
grateful man he's gone again


Oh, to be not anyone
Gone this maze of being skin
Oh, to cry not any cry
So mournful that the dove just laughs the steadfast gasps

Oh, to owe not anyone
Nothing to be
Not here but here
Forsaking equatorial bliss

Who walked through the callow mist
Dressed in scraps
Who walked the curve of the world
Whose bone scraped, whose flesh unfurled

Who grieves not, anyone gone to greet lame
The inspired sky amazed to stumble
Where God's get lost
Beneath the southern cross


Toward another
He has gone
To breathe an air
Beyond his own
Toward a wisdom
Beyond the shelf
Toward a dream
That dreams itself

About a boy
Beyond it all
About a boy
Beyond it all

From the forest
From the foam
From the field
That he had
Known
Toward a river
Twice as blessed
Toward the inn
Of happiness

About a boy
Beyond it all
About a boy
Beyond it all

From a chaos
Raging sweet
From the deep
And dismal street
Toward another
Kind of peace
Toward the great
Emptiness

About a boy
Beyond it all
About a boy
Beyond it all

I stood among them
I stood alone
Boy boy
Just a boy
Just a little boy
Just a little boy
Who will never grow


We waltzed beneath motionless skies
all heaven's glory turned in your eyes
we expressed such sweet vows

oh till death do us part
oh till death do us part
oh-oh

We waltzed beneath God's point of view
knowing no ending to our rendezvous
we expressed such sweet vows

oh till death do us part
oh till death do us part
oh-oh

oh till death do us part
oh till death do us part
oh-oh

We waltzed beneath motionless skies
all heaven's glory turned in your eyes
you pledged me your heart

till death do us part
you pledged me your heart
till death do us part
till death do us part


I was down in Georgia
nothing was as real
as the street beneath my feet
descending into air

The cauldron was a-bubbling
the flesh was lean
and the women moved forward
like piranhas in a stream
they spread themselves before me
an offering so sweet
and they beckoned and they beckoned
come on darling eat

Eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat

They circled around me
natives in a ring
and I saw their souls a-withering
like snakes in chains
and they wrapped themselves around me
ummm what a treat
and they rattled their tales hissin'
come on let's eat

Eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat

I felt a rising in my throat
the girls a-saying grace
and the air the viscous air
pressed against my face
and it all got too damn much for me
just got too damn rough
and I pushed away my plate
and said boys I've had enough
and I laid upon the table
another piece of meat
and I opened up my veins to them
and said come on eat

Eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat

Cause I was down in Georgia
nothing was as real
as the street beneath my feet
descending into hell

So eat eat eat
you eat eat eat
you eat eat eat
eat eat eat


Dead to the world my body was sleeping
on my mind was nothing at all
come a mist an aire so appealing
I'm here a whispering you summouned I called

I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing
oh he would shift he would not shift at all
we sat for a while he was very engaging
and when he was gone I was gone on a smile

With a strange way of walking
and a strange way of breathing
more lives than a cat
that let me astray
all in all he captured my heart
dead to the world and just
slipped away

I heard me a music that drew me to dancing
lo I turned under his spell
I opened my coat but he never came closer
I bolted the door and whispered oh well

With a strange way of walking
and a strange way of breathing
more lives than a cat
that let me astray
all in all he captured my heart
dead to the world and just
slipped away

I laid in the rushes the air was upon me
wondering well I just couldn't discern
will he come back come back to me
oh I whispered will you ever return

I was feeling sensations in no dictionary
he was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke
the life in his fingers unwound my existence
dead to the world alive I awoke

With a strange way of walking
and a strange way of breathing
less than a breath of shimmer and smoke
the life in his fingers unwound my existence
dead to the world alive I awoke
alive I awoke
alive alive I awoke
alive I awoke
alive I awoke
alive
I awoke
I awoke
alive I awoke
alive alive-o
alive alive-o


I was a wing in heaven blue
soared over the ocean
soared over Spain
and I was free
needed nobody
it was beautiful
it was beautiful

I was a pawn
didn't have a move
didn't have nowhere
that I could go
but I was free
I needed nobody
it was beautiful
it was beautiful

and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue

I was a vision
in another eye
and they saw nothing
no future at all
yet I was free
I needed nobody
it was beautiful
it was beautiful

and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue

and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue

and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue


Common fortune seeks us all
and slips our binding rings
we'll turn our heads
and make us reel
we'll bare our arms as wings

before our feet a feather drifts
beyond us it will fall
cause time will bid and make us rise
make ravens of us all

My love he breathed the air of kings
yet fell beneath his luck
and in his heart a yearning yet
before his time time shook
all the gifts that God had gave
and those by fate denied
gone to where all treasures laid
and where the raven flies

oh there are places I agree
where I have yet to roam
the Egyptian field
the arctic sea where shadows
haunt and moan
but none but sky
I have to go
should I return to thee
gone to where the feather flies
to all eternity
but for a time I got more time
till I a raven be

cause time will bid and make us rise
make ravens of us all
and time will bid and make us fly
make ravens of us all
and time will bid and make us fly
make ravens of us all


There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come,
With a mind that multiplied
The smallest matter.
When questioned who had sent for him,
He answered with his thumb,
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.

He stayed behind the assembly hall,
It was there he made his bed,
Oftentimes he could be seen returning.
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read,
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."

Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part,
And the people that confronted him were many.
And he was told but these few words,
Which opened up his heart,
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."


I been walking
wherefore am I walking
I been walking

If you see me walking
a-walking a-walking
if you see me walking

Don't avert your eyes
don't turn away
don't turn away
I'm coming to you
oh-oh oh oh
oh-oh oh to you

Living in steps
till I can rest
living in steps
till I'm blessed by you

I and I alone
can but do for you
to twist in my hand
the thorn of thy youth
to draw thy seed
to turn in birth
thy sighs
(living in steps)
thy moans
till we can rest
living in steps
till I'm by you

all I ever wanted

I and I alone
I will wash your feet
and dry them with my hair
I will give to you
every other tear
thy breath thy spear
thy season of mirth
seven steps
until I can rest
seven steps
til I am blessed by you
all I ever wanted
I wanted I wanted
all I ever wanted
I wanted for you

oh-wo-wo ...
oh-wo-wo ...
all I ever wanted
I wanted for you

five steps
till I can rest
five steps
till I'm blessed by you

four steps
till I can rest
four steps
till I'm blessed by you

all I ever wanted
I wanted I wanted
all I ever wanted
I wanted for you

I and I alone
ghost of thy ghost
walk I will walk
a burning stem
to illume thy night
(three steps...)
blood of my blood
bone of my bone
(three steps...)
can but do for you
I and I alone

two steps
till I can rest
two steps
till I'm blessed by you

oh oh oh ...
can but do for you
I and I alone
oh oh oh ...


It's been a hard time
and when it rains
it rains on me
the sky just opens
and when it rains
it pours

I walk alone
assaulted it seems
by tears from heaven
and darling I can't help
thinking those tears are yours

Our wild love came from above
and wilder still
is the wind that howls
like a voice that knows it's gone
cause darling you died
and well I cried
but I'll get by
salute our love
and send you a smile
and move on

So darling farewell
all will be well
and then all will be fine
the children will rise
strong and happy be sure
cause your love flows
and the corn still grows
and God only knows
we're only given
as much as the heart can endure

But I don't know why
but when it rains
it rains on me
the sky just opens
and when it rains
it pours

But I look up
and a rainbow appears
like a smile from heaven
and darling I can't
help thinking that smile
is yours


If you believe all your hope is gone
down the drain of your humankind
the time has arrived
you'll be waiting here as I was
in a snow-white shroud
waiting underground

there by the ridge be a gathering beneath the pilgrim moon
where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
where the great ones tremble
in their snow-white shrouds
waiting underground

if you seek the kingdom come, come along
waiting by the ridge there'll be a gathering
beneath the pilgrim moon
where the (railroad) thunders

oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
and as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble
and your humankind becomes as one
and then we will arise
in our snow-white shrouds
when we'll be as one
but until that day we will just await
in our snow-white shrouds
waiting underground
in our snow-white shrouds
waiting underground

Waiting underground [X6]


Hello friend I've come a-calling
passively stationed
active patrol
sliding in at high noon like some reluctant sheriff
not want to get involved in it all

who stands guard for each other
why must we guard anything at all
anything at all

from the earth's four corners the people are calling
forming equations but the questions are hard
all men are brothers killing each other
and mother earth is wringing in wonder

who stands guard for each other
why must we guard anything at all
anything at all
whirl away now [X3]
whirl away

there's a cross on the road
there's a great mill turning
some seeking answers
some born to dancers
you can hold on the blade and turn around forever
be flung into space into another kind of grace

who stands guard for each other
why must we guard anything at all
anything at all
whirl away now [X3]
whirl away
whirl away now [X3]
whirl away

[?]
some giveth their hand
some giveth their land
some giveth their life
you lay in the fields of grain
the staff of life all around you
but yet you, you will cut someone down for their possessions
some material thing
and our children are being blown away like wishes in the wind
for the sake of their coat
or the colors of their coat
or the color of their skin
or the name on their shoes
and the mother cries "Why they taken my son?"
and the father wonders "Are they taking my boy?"
he extended his hand
he gave them his land
he gave them his bread
he gave them his heart
said hello friend
hello friend [X4]


Listen to my story
Got two tales to tell
One of fallen glory
One of vanity

The world's roof was raging
But we were looking fine
'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings
In 1959

Wisdom was a teapot
Pouring from above
Desolation angels
Served it up with love

Igniting like every form of light
Then moved by bold design
Slid in that thing and it grew wings
In 1959

It was blood shining in the sun
First, freedom
Speeding the American claim
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom

China was the tempest
Madness overflowed
Lama was a young man
And watched his world in flames

Taking glory down by the edge of clouds
It was a crying shame
Another lost horizon
Tibet the fallen star

Wisdom and compassion crushed
In the land of Shangri-La
But in the land of the Impala
Honey, well, we were lookin' fine

'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings
In 1959
'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings
In 1959

It was the best of times, it's the worst of times
In 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
1959


Holy holy holy holy holy
Holy holy holy holy holy
Holy holy holy holy holy

The world is holy, the soul is holy
The skin is holy, the nose is holy
The tongue and cock and hand and asshole
Holy

Everything is holy, everybody's holy, everywhere is holy
Everyday is in eternity, every man is an angel
The bum's as holy as the seraphim
The madman is holy as you my soul are holy

The typewriter is holy, the poem is holy
The voice is holy, the hearers are holy, the ecstasy is holy
Holy Peter, holy Allen, holy Solomon, holy Lucien
Holy Kerouac, holy Huncke, holy Burroughs, holy Cassady

Holy the unknown buggered and suffering beggars
Holy the hideous human angels
Holy my mother in the insane asylum
Holy the cocks of the grandfathers of Kansas
Holy the groaning saxophone, holy the bop apocalypse
(Holy the bop)
Apocalypse
(Apocalypse)
Apocalypse

Holy the jazz bands, marijuana
Hipsters, peace and junk and dreams
Holy the solitudes of skyscrapers and pavements
Holy the cafeterias filled with the millions

Holy the mysterious rivers of tears under the streets
Holy the lone juggernaut, holy the vast lamb of the middle class
Holy the crazy shepherds of rebellion
Who digs Los Angeles is Los Angeles

Holy New York, holy San Francisco
Holy Peoria and Seattle, holy Paris
Holy Tangiers, holy Moscow, holy Istanbul
Holy time in eternity, body, holy eternity in time

Holy the clocks in space, holy the fourth dimension
Holy the fifth International, holy the Angel in Moloch
Holy the sea, holy the desert, holy the railroad
Holy the locomotive, holy the visions, holy the hallucination

Holy the miracles, holy the eyeball, holy the abyss
Holy forgiveness, mercy, charity, faith
Holy ours, bodies suffering magnanimity
Holy the supernatural, extra brilliant, intelligent, kindness of the soul


Lower the thing the skin of a cat
Skin it to the left just laying there
No other thing is luck like that
And you set it said it said nothing

Went to the party very discouraged
I watched the litter pile like a wall
I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it
It was ladened with all kinds of shit
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing
I turned my back walked away
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing

Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner
I was listening they were saying this and saying that
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered
Nothing good was coming I just stood there
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing
I walked the floor then I looked away

Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing

How long how long will we make do
Maybe it's time to break on through
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card
Well I'm gonna do something
Oh my brain I got to complain
You can refrain but I'm gonna do something
How long how long will we make do
Maybe it's time to break on through

Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned
I saw it floating in the river
I saw and no one seemed to mind
They sat there they sat there watching the sun
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun
Spread its wings and fly away
And in the mountains a cry echoes
Don't say nothing
Don't say nothing no
Don't say nothing no


This dead city longs to be
This dead city longs to be free
Seven screaming horses
Melt down in the sun
Building scenes on empty dreams
And smoking them one by one

This dead city longs to be
This dead city longs to be living
Is it any wonder there's squalor in the sun
With their broken schemes and their lotteries
They never get nowhere

Is it any wonder they're spitting at the sun
God's parasites in abandoned sites
and they never have much fun

If I was a blind man
Would you see for me
Or would you confuse
The nature of my blues
And refuse a hand to me

Is it any wonder crying in the sun
Is it any wonder I'm crying in the sun
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes
Now I'm burning them one by one

This damn city this dead city
Immortal city
Motor city
Suc-cess city
Longs to be
Longs to be
Free
Free
Free


Mother as I write the sun dissolves
Blood life streaming cross my hand
And these words, these words
Hope dashed immortal hope
Hope streaking the canvas sky
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write

We joined the long caravan
Hungry dreaming going west
Just for work just to get a job
And we never got lucky
We just forged on
And the dust the endless dust
Like a plague it covered everything
Hal fell with the fever
And mother I did what I could
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write

We prayed we prayed for rain
I never wanted to see the sun again

All my dresses you made by hand
We left behind on the road
Hal died in my arms
We buried him by the river
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write


In the straw-colored light
In light rapidly changing
On a life rapidly fading

Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing

With a throat smooth as a lamb
Yet dry as a branch not snapping
He throws back his head
And he does not sing a thing mournful

Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light

He sings a black embrade
And white opals swimming
In a child's leather purse
Have you seen death swimming
Have you seen death swimming

With a throat smooth as a lamb
Yet dry as a branch not snapping
He throws back his head
And he does not sing a thing mournful

Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light

He sings of youth enraged
And the burning of Atlanta
And these viral times
And May ribbons streaming
And straw-colored curls a-turning
A mother's vain delight
And woe to the sun
And woe to the young
Another hearse is drawn
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light
