(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah
(Yes! The battleground's right here!)
(It's a man's world!)
(Come on!)
(Gotta get ready for this right here)
(Hey, yo)

Fear's awake, anger beats loud, face reality
Never beat charity
The enemy you're fighting covers all society
(Damn right)
Mommy's not here, gotta fight
(All night)

Right here, Shadow 10 o'clock direction
Seize the moment, destroy the nation
Your rhyme is slow-motion, give me motivation
Freaked out now, and dead on arrival
(What?)

Round up around, spit out
All over
Rhyme like a rolling stone
Comin' a crowd
Watch out, they move, they diss you loud
Guess what this sound, it bombs whole ground
(So round up)

Don't ease your pace, 'cuz enemy's brutal
Moment of truth, There ain't no truce
You're the only one, one world, one love
But the battle goes on, Shadows of mass destruction

Ooh yeah,

Dada-dada, dada-dada,
Baby, baby,
Da-dada-dada, dada-dada

Ooh yeah,
Dada-dada, dada-dada,
Baby, baby,
Da-dada-dada, dada-dada

(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah
(Oh... hey yo. You better get ready for this right now)
(This is a battle scene...)
(You can't stop it!)
(Uh, get ready)
(Take it hot, right now)

I thought told y'all to sit down or get down
I'm about'a hit ground
When I'm in the box, my hits way out of this bounds
Nobody's topping me
(You know it, damn right)
Most of y'alls loving me
(Doing it all night)

Keeping my friends close, and my foes closer
Things getting messy, but I never lick the nose up
As I get older, see things slower
My enemies looking like kids, and I'm the grown up
(Forget it)

I'm the next masterpiece made
A new generation came up with the beast "Ace"
But I'm the mister nice guy
See me I'm a wise guy
Not a mafioso, but I hustle like Mike

Lay low if you're feelin' me
I take these beats, freaks go crazy with me
So put 'em up in these break with me
So shake with the man, L to the J's, now follow me

Ooh yeah,
Da-dada-dada, dada-dada,
Baby, baby,
Da-dada-dada, dada-dada,

Ooh yeah,
Da-dada-dada, dada-dada,
Baby, baby,
Da-dada-dada, dada-dada,
