
All of this and more is for you
With love, sincerity and deepest care
My life with you I share


Ever since I met you, baby
I've been wantin' to lay you down
But it's so hard to get you
Baby, when you never come around
Every day that you keep it away
It only makes me want it more
Ooh baby, just say the word
And I'll be at your door

What more do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

Ever since I met you, baby
There's been somethin' inside of me
That keeps me wantin' you
Baby, won't you set me free?
Take off these chains, girl
And I'll take off yours
There's no one in the world, baby
That I wanna love more

What else do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
I'm fallin' baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin' baby, deeper everyday
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
And I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(In love)
I'm drownin' baby, in my love foy you
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
I just don't, I don't know what to say

In love
In love
Oh baby-girl, you're takin' me away
Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby
In love
In love


Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I wanna lose in you,
Baby can you stand the pain
Hey, lover, sugar don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooo baby!
All I wanna see is the love in your eyes (hey, lover)
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
All I wanna feel is burning flames (hey, lover)
Tell me, tell me, baby, that U feel the same
Tell me that U feel the same way I do
Tell me that U love me girl

[We'd be so lost, in our mouths, the best, I feel it everyday (every way)
U feel so wrong, be alone, if u just follow somebody someday]

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Ooo weee, baby. you leave me without...
Breath! Ooo, baby! Oooo, yeah

You're just as soft as a lion tamed (hey, lover)
You're just as wet as the evening rain
How will I take it when you call my name? (hey, lover)
Your love is driving me...
you're driving me insane
Crazy, baby
Oh, girl
Crazy 'bout your love

Soft and wet (U know)
You are soft and wet (Oh, sugar)
Your love is soft and wet
Soft and wet


You have got a strange way about you
Kinda' crazy but I love you just the same
Because you, oh you make me wanna do, oh everything

I'm just a crazy fool, lost in the world of love
I get from crazy you, oh, I'm so strung out
Thinking 'bout the crazy things you do, crazy you


You can live your own life and I'll live mine
I will never try to keep you down
And even if I only see you some of the time
I'm just happy when you come around
And even if the sun don't shine

I'm warm enough when
You're in these arms of mine
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

There is nothing that will overcome the love we share
Nothing that will break us apart
Girl, I gotta always have you in my ear
Gotta always have you in my heart
Oh baby, your place or mine?
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine

Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, there's nothing better
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

Just as long as there is you
I'll be around doing what you what me to
Just as long as there is me
I'll be around to sing that melody, sugar

Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright

Don't you know there ain't better oh


Baby, what are we gonna do?
I'm so in love with you
Baby, what are we gonna do?
I know you're in love with me too

Should we go on livin' together
Or should we get married right away?
Whatever you decide, I'll still love you, baby
An' we'll grow stronger everyday

Baby, what are we gonna do?
I barely have enough money for two
Baby, what are we gonna do?
I don't want to regret what I've done to you

I never would've thought that this would happen
To a very careful man like me
But baby, pretty baby, we're gonna work it out, yeah
I love you, I love you, can't you see?

Baby, baby, baby
It's you, said it's you, I truly adore
Baby, baby, we're gonna work it out
I hope our baby has eyes just like yours


You're always on my mind
Day and night, baby, all the time
(All the time)
You mean so much to me
A love like ours just hard to be

You're the wind and the rain
You've got a river that takes away my pain
And the sky that's, oh, so blue
You're everything girl, don't you know I need you
(Need you)

You are the only thing that keeps me goin'
You are the only thing that keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, you see, my love is forever

Sugar, I don't have to dream
'Cause you give me what I want
Girl, you know what I need
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
(Love you)

Oh, oh, what does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me
I'll never, never stop loving you
Never, never stop wanting you
Never, never get enough of you, love is forever

You are the only thing that keeps me goin'
You are the only thing, keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, my love is forever


I had everything I needed
But now my life is so blue
You meant the world to me
But now you're gone and I'm so blue

Even though the sun is shining
I spend my day, I spend my day crying over you
Oh yeah, I spend my day crying over you
I feel just like the sky, oh, so blue

Oh baby, don't you know?
Baby don't you know?
I spend my nights, it's all alone
Talking to myself, I am so blue

And everyday the feeling gets stronger
And who's to say, just how much longer
I can spend my nights all alone

Talking to myself and just crying over you
I guess I'll just spend my life
So, so blue


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up until the other day
There remained an empty space within my bed
Then I took one look at you
And naughty things that we could do

I took one look at you
And all the things that we could do
Dance within my head

Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yea, I'm yours

I'll give you what you want
But please love me now
I'll do anything you want
You're the teacher, show me how

Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yea
I'm yours


I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
And it's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover! Yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild!
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby. No!
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long make you shout
Oh, lover! Yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah


There's some talk going 'round town
That you really don't give a damn
They say you really put me down
When I'm doing the best I can
I gave you all of my love
I even gave you my body
Tell me, baby, ain't that enough?
What more do you want me to do?
I play the fool when we're together
But I cry when we're apart, yeah
I couldn't do you no better
Don't break what left of my broken heart, baby

Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?

You know, I try so hard
To keep you satisfied
Sometimes you play the part
Sometimes you're so full of pride
And if it's still good to ya
Why you wanna treat me so bad?
You used to love it when I'd do you
You used to say I was the best you'd ever had

I play the fool when we're together
I give you everything I can, yeah
And if it's still good to ya
There's something that I can't understand

Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?


Sexy dancer
Sexy dancer
Sexy dancer, you got my body screamin'
Sexy dancer, you got me just-a-creamin'
Sexy dancer, when you rub my body
Sexy dancer, it gets me so hot...hot!
Sexy dancer, sexy dancer
Sexy dancer, sexy dancer

Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body

Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body

Hot!


When we're dancing close and slow
I never want to let you go, no, no
I feel your warm embrace
The softness of your face
Tell me, baby, are we here alone?
When we're kissing long and hard
I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see
Baby, that's honestly the way I feel

When we're dancing close and slow
I'm not afraid to let my feelings show
I want to come inside of you
I want to hold you when we're through
Can't you feel my love touching you?


I've held your hand so many times
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time
I've kissed your lips and laid with you
And I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms
I guess my eyes can only see as far as you
I only want to be with you

We've come so far in so little time
Sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
Sometimes you are so very kind
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared that you're gonna leave

I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I only want to be with you

I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I always, always want to be with you


I knew from the start
That I loved you with all my heart
But you were untrue.
You had another lover and she looked just like you
Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

It's so hard to believe
Maybe it's because you're so young
Or maybe I'm just too naive
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun

Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

All your lovers - they look just like you
But they can only do the things that you do
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man

Bambi, I know what you need
Bambi, maybe you need to bleed

Yeah!


All my friends tell me
About the loves they've had
Can't they see what they're doing to me?
It makes me feel so bad
'Cause I'm so alone
And brokenhearted
It ain't like my life is ended
But more like it never started
The love my friends rap about I keep anticipating
I try so hard but don't you know, my patience is fading away
Still waiting
I'm waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
Waiting for the love to come around
Oh, love.
Waiting for the love to come around

People say that I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
But they don't know, they really don't know
That's all that I've been dreaming of
'Cause I spend my nights just a-crying
And I spend my days just a-trying
To find that love to call my own
'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone

Still waiting
Waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love to come around.
(Waiting for the love) Don't you know that I'm waiting
(Waiting for the love) Say..
(Waiting for the love) To come around now

I need somebody to hold on to baby
Waiting and waiting, don't you know that I'm

Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love, sugar
Still waiting
If you're out there girl, please come to me
Still waiting
Don't make me cry no more
Still waiting
If you're out there, baby, please come to me
Still waiting
Wishing and wishing for days, baby
Still waiting
If you're out there, girl, please come to me
Still waiting


Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Play

I think it's love
I feel for you - I think it's love
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think it's love

Play

I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you


We've been together for quite some time
I'd think by now you'd know
It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
And I'd be so lonely

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
'til I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree
It gets me every time
I betcha thatcha never knew that in my dreams you are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are

Don't you know it's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
Giving me everything that I need
Oh pretty baby, can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely
Oh, whatever's in your kiss
I never could resist
Oh, baby don't go!

We've been together for quite some time
It'd take forever to get you off my mind
Oh, girl!

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you by my side
Don't you know that I could die, baby

Without you loving me
Can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

It's gonna be lonely, baby
So lonely, baby


There's something about u, baby
It happens all the time
Whenever I'm around u, baby
I get a dirty mind
It doesn't matter where we are
It doesn't matter who's around
It doesn't matter
I just wanna lay ya down
In my daddy's car
It's you I really wanna drive
But you never go too far
I may not be your kind of man
I may not be your style
But honey all I wanna do
Is just love you for a little while

If you got the time
I'll give you some money
To buy a dirty mind
Don't misunderstand me
I never fool around
But honey you got me on my knees
Won't you please let me lay ya down (down, down, down...)

I really get a dirty mind (mind, mind, mind...)
Whenever you're around
It happens to me everytime (time, time, time...)

You just gotta let me lay ya
Gotta let me lay ya, lay ya
You just gotta let me lay ya
Gotta let me lay ya down

In my daddy's car
It's you I really wanna drive
Underneath the stars
I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around

I don't wanna hurt you, baby
I only want to lay you down


When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
It was just like a dream
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
You didn't have the decency 
To change the sheets

Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (so fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love u, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind (so blind)
I let you fool around
I never cared (didn't care)
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping inbetween the two of us

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
U were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more that I did
When you were mine

When you were mine, yeah, oh no
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
When you were mine


Pardon me, I wanna talk to you
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you
What I'm going to do
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you
I don't care cuz
I really wanna hold you
And I'm so scared
[Girl], he might do something
To you that you like
Now I've been waiting
Such a bloody long time
Just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I wanna do
Oh, I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it
Do it to you right
Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy
When it comes to loving you Can't you understand that I want
To hug and kiss you
I'll do anything I can just
To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, c'mon baby
Can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I wanna mention

I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right
Do it all night
I,I wanna do it, oh yeah

Do it all night
Do it to you right

Do it all night
Do it to you right


I've gotta broken heart again
Cuz we're only supposed to be friends
You see he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
I've gotta broken heart again
Cuz I ain't got no money to spend
You see I spend it all on long distance phone calls
Beggin her to please come home, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
It doesn't matter what I do
I can't stop, ah, thinking about uou
The little things you said
The things you do to me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you outta my head
Oh, oh, gotta broken heart again, yeah
This time it's serious
It feels just like the end
Cuz once your love has gone away
There ain't nothing, nothing left to say


She saw me walking down the streets
Of your fine city
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me
And said, "C'mere"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers
But she looked so pretty
What can I lose,
If I, uh, just give her a little ear?
"What's up little girl?"
"I ain't got time to play."
Baby didn't say too much
She said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by suprise
I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes
And I said, "No, are u?"
Said to myself, said
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy
Little mixed up dame.
She's just a victim of society
And all it's games."
Now where I come from
We don't let society
Tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair
We don't care
It's all about being there
Everybody's going Uptown
That's where I wanna be
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't wanna stop, no
As soon as we got there
Good times were rolling
White, Black, Puerto Rican
Everybody just a-freakin'
Good times were rolling

She started dancing in the streets
Ow, girl, she's just gone mad
U know, she even made love to me
Ooh, best night I ever had
Ah yeah
I never talk to strangers
But this time it's all right
See, she got me hot, ah
I couldn't stop, ah
Good times were rolling all night All night, yeah
Now where I come from

I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was burnin' to love me and loose

She don't wear no underwear
She's so lonely, gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stoppin' the juice

My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality

Showed me where it's supposed to go
A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out

She took a whip to me until I shout
Oh, motherfucker's, just a motherfucker
Can't you understand?

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister

Stand up everybody, this is your life
Let me take u to another world, let me take u tonight
U don't need no money, u don't need no clothes
The Second Coming, anything goes
Sexuality is all u'll ever need
Sexuality - let your body be free

C'mon everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talking about a revolution we gotta organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

I'm OK as long as u are here with me

Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize

One time say...

We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists - 89 flowers on their back...inventors of the Accu-jack
They look at life through a pocket camera... What? No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that Love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are u listening?
We need a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight and breed
No child is bad from the beginning... they only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and US history
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3... absolutely nothing

Stand Up, Organize
We need a new breed...Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
I wanna be in the new breed, Stand up, Organize
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free

I guess I should've known by the way
You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"

And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", Oh yeah

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes, you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast

Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
2 get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here 2 tell u
There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never ending happiness
U can always see the sun, day or night

So when u call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
U know the one - Dr Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cuz in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if de-elevator tries 2 bring u down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If u don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around u
At least u got friends

U see I called my old lady
4 a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Sex, sex) is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no Let's Go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look 4 the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cuz
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all 4 (What's it all 4)
U better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look 4 the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
Crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll be alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and dafodills will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!


I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes what can I say
They turn me on

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do

We want each other oh so much
Why must we play this game?

Don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is 2 spend the night together
All I want is 2 spend the night in your arms

To be around u is so-oh right
You're sheer perfection (thank u)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection

Where has it gone?
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong

Until I find the righteous 1
Computer blue
Until I find the righteous 1

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind

Darlin' Nikki

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

[backwards at the end...]
"Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon."


Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe you're just too demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)

Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)

Don't Cry (Don't Cry)

When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry

When Doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain
Purple rain Purple rain
Purple rain Purple rain

I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new

A wonderful trip through our time
And laughter is all U pay

Around the world in a day

Now dig
Loneliness already knows U
There ain't no reason 2 stay
Come here and take my hand, I'll show U
I think I know a better way, y'all

Around the world in a day

The little 1 will escort U
2 places within your mind
The former is red, white, and blue
The ladder is purple, come on and climb

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
Come on, sing
Around the world in a day
Say papa, I think I wanna dance

(summer she is sweet)

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
All the little babies, sing around the world
Around the world in a day

A government of love and music boundless in its unifying power
A nation of alms, the production, sharing ideas, a shower of flowers

There is a park that is known
4 the face it attracts
Colorful people whose hair
On 1 side is swept back
The smile on their faces
It speaks of profound inner peace
Ask where they're going
They'll tell U nowhere
They've taken a lifetime lease
On Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

There is a woman who sits
All alone by the pier
Her husband was naughty
And caused his wife so many tears
He died without knowing forgiveness
And now she is sad, so sad
Maybe she'll come 2 the park
And forgive him
And life won't be so bad
In Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

See the man cry as the city
Condemns where he lives
Memories die but taxes
He'll still have 2 give
(who) Whoever said that elephants
Were stronger than mules?
Come 2 the park
And play with us
There aren't any rules
In Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

Your heart, your heart
Paisley Park
Your heart, your heart, your heart (sing, sing it)
Paisley Park

There was a girl in Paris
Whom he sent a letter 2
Hoping she would answer back
Now wasn't that a fool
Hardy notion on the part of a
Sometimes lonely musician
Acting out a whim is only good
4 a condition of the heart

There was a dame from London
Who insisted that he love her
Then left him 4 a real prince
From Arabia, now isn't that
A shame that sometimes money
Buys U everything and nothing
Love, it only seems 2 buy a
Terminal condition of the heart

Thinking about U driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a woman from the ghetto
Who made funny faces just like
Clara Bow, how was I 2 know
That she would wear the same
Cologne as U and giggle the same
Giggle that U do?
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool
With a condition of the heart

Thinking about U driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every single day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a girl (There was a girl in Paris)
Whom he sent a letter to... (Whom he sent a letter 2)
(Hoping she would answer back)
She never answered back and now (wasn't that a foolhardy)
He's got a condition of the heart. (notion ...)


1 2 1 2 3

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve 2 ask me
If I planned 2 do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't 2 bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how 2 get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who U are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
U feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance 2 do it all again

I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind U find (The kind U find)
The kind U find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

I think I... I think I... I think I love her

(Raspberry beret)
No No No
No No No (The kind U find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love.


Oh my God here U are
Prettiest thing in life I've ever seen
Close my eyes what's it like,
What's it like inside your tamborine?

Oh my God, there I go
Falling in love with the face in a magazine (uh oh, not again)
All alone by myself
Me and I play my tamborine

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine

I don't care 4 1 night stands
With trolley cars
That juggle 17
I just want 2 settle down and
Play around
My baby's tamborine

Tamborine what are U
Why are U the star of
All my dreams
(Star of all my dreams, are U a good tamborine)
Are U good, are U bad
Are U just unnecessary means

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Trolley cars

Long days, lonely nights
2 bad we're not allowed 2 scream (yeah, yeah, too bad)
Guess that I'll stay at home
All alone and play my tamborine (aww)

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
The tamborine


Yeah
Peace!

Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty

Sex
Temptation
Lust
Pop go mama

Everybody on this earth has got a vice
And mine, little darlin', mine is the opposite of ice
Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality
In other words, this little prince thinks a lot about U, see?
Baby, baby, baby
I'm guilty in the first degree

Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Everybody in this room

Purplelectricity whenever our bodies touch
Ooh baby, I love it when our bodies touch

A lover

You have 2 want her 4 the right reasons."

"U don't, now die!"

No! No!

Let me go, let me go.

I'm sorry.
I'll be good.
This time I promise,
Love is more important than sex.
Now I understand.
I have 2 go now.
I don't know when I'll return.
Good-bye

Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
17 mountains stood so high.
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made u cry
U said the devil told u that another mountain would appear
Everytime somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would 1 day overflow with all your tears,
And love will always leave u lonely

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, u and me

Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,
happiness sometimes hard 2 find. (yeah)
Africa divided, hijack in the air,
it's enough to make you want to lose your mind

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (Oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, u and me

Guitars and drums on the 1

It's only mountains (oh yeah) and the sea. (and the girls sing)
There's nothing greater, u and me

just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
and all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past


Oh yeah
In France a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Time, time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
U turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' U somebody died
Sister killed her baby cuz she could afford 2 feed it
And we're sending people 2 the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer 4 the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

Times, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why
Time, time

Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket blows
And everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh why, oh why, Sign O the Times

Time, time

Sign O the Times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's 2 late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate... if it's a boy

Time, time

Time, time


Oooh Doggies!
We wanna play in the sunshine
We wanna be free
Without the help of a Margarita or Exstacy
We wanna kick like we used 2
Sign up on the dotted line
We gonna dance every dance
Like it's gonna be the last time

We got 2 play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up 2 10
I want 2 meet U (meet U), kiss U (kiss U),
love U (love U), and miss U (miss U)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

Play in the sunshine

We gonna love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're gonna rock him
We're gonna roll him
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)

Aah, pop goes the music
When the big white rabbit begin 2 talk
And the color green will make your best friends leave ya
It will make them do the walk
But that's cool
Cuz one day, everyday will be a yellow day
and let's play

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered - "Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry"
Dorothy laughed
She said "Sounds like a real man 2 me"
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?
(do you wanna, do you wanna, bath)
I said "Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on" (she say)
"Cuz I'm kind of going with someone"
She said "Sounds like a real man 2 me"
"Mind if I turn on the radio?"
"Oh, my favorite song" she said
And it was Joni singing "Help me I think I'm falling"
(Ring)
The phone rang and she said
"Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U"
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back
2 the violent room (tell us what U did)
Let me tell U what I did...

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker

Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well


I think about IT baby all the time, all right
IT feels so good IT must be a crime, all right
I wanna do IT baby every day, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right
I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

I could be guilty 4 my honesty, all right
But I've got 2 tell U what U mean 2 me, all right (all right)
With U I swear, I'm a maniac, all right
U see IT ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right

I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right

It was 7:45 we were all in line
2 greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day
If U asked her what she had 4 breakfast
This is what she'd say
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, U know what we found?

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, honey
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Starfish and coffee

Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's 4 a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singin'

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so)
(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so)


Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that U're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
4 he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make IT slow
Just like the wind blows

Let's make IT last forever
For a hundred times won't be enough
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feelin'
You've got me reelin'

U can see through race car drivers
Let me show U what I'm made of
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

[repeated to fade]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down 2 the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want 2 settle down
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell U that I wanna with U (baby, if U do 2)
And baby if U do 2

Not that you're helpless

Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

Would U let me wash your hair
Could I make U breakfast sometime

Could we go 2 a movie and cry together

Is it really necessary 4 me 2 go out of the room

And then, we don't have 2 make love 2 have an orgasm
Your body's what I'm all about
Can I see U?
I'll show U
Why not?
U can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it 4 U
Of course I'll undress in front of U!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
How can I make U see that it's cool?
Can't U just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend U could
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, 4 U naked I would dance a ballet
Would that get U off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would U tell me?
Would U let me see U naked then?
Would U let me give U a bath?
Would U let me tickle U so hard U'd laugh and laugh
And would U, would U let me kiss U there
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold U tight and hold U long
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try 2 imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try...

Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie

I'll take all the blame, yo baby I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way U where, so I had 2 make U mine

Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad

It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
It was 10:35 on a lonely friday night
She was standin' by the bar
Hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
I asked if she wanted 2 dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted 2 know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified 4 a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man

It hurt me so bad when she told me
with tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted 2 die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way
She couldn't stop cryin'
Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
U know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied

And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
U wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand
And I could never take the place of your man

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man


Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, he is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross
Ghettos 2 the left of us
Flowers 2 the right
There'll be bread 4 all of us
If we can just bear the cross

Sweet song of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all that she brings

We all have our problems
Some BIG, some are small
Soon all of our problems
Will be taken by the cross

Black day, stormy night

Said the table 2 the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chillblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair (can't nobody)

Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able! (fuck with us)
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!" (can't nobody)
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try (fuck with us)
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?" (say, can't nobody)

So they both went showly down (fuck with us)
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound (can't nobody)
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side (fuck with us)
"See the table and the chair
Have come 2 take the air!" (y'all - say it y'all)

But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house.

When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother! (can't nobody fuck with us)
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little browny- (say it, y'all)
mousey and the beetle dined,
And danced upon the heads
Till they toddled to their beds. (can't nobody fuck with us)

Until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
U own my heart and mind
I truly adore U
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see
Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what U mean 2 me

From the first moment I saw U
Ooh, I knew U where the 1
That night I had 2 call U
I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' U just how fine U look
In a word, U were sex
All of my cool attitude U took
My body was next
U made love 2 me
Like U where afraid
Was U afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
That's why

Until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
U own my heart and mind
I truly adore U
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see
Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what U mean 2 me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know U are my fix
I know, that U know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just 4 kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby
U could say that I'm a terminal case
U could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got 2 have your face
All up in the place

I'd like 2 think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare
2 your lovely face
Do U know what I'm sayin' 2 ya this evening
I'm just tryin' 2 say
I'm just tryin' 2 say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
I'll be there 4 U
On my heart, on my mind, (truly adore U)
I truly adore U (darlin')
U don't know what you're mean 2 me
Baby, (until the end of time)
Baby, (I'll be there 4 U)
Baby, (U own my heart and mind)
'Til the end of time I'll be there 4 U
(I truly adore U)
Adore U (adore U)

Can I talk 2 U? {{chorus repeated in background}}
Tell U what U mean 2 me
Every time U wander
I'll be your eyes so U can see
I wanna show U things
That I show no other, I wanna be
More than, more than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be (like no) like no other
If U need me, I'll never leave
I know, that U know, without U there is no me
There is no me
Without U there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is 2 weak 2 define how much I adore
U, child
U, child
The last words U hear
The last words U hear

(until the end of time)
I'll be there for you, baby
(until the end of time)

Be with me darlin' til the end of time (until the end of time)
I'll give U my heart
I'll give U my mind
I'll give U my body (until the end of time)
I'll give U my time (until the end of time)
(until the end of time)

4 all time I am with U
U are with me
(until the end of time)
U are with me, U are with me


Rain is wet, and sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, and stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows
When love calls, U gotta go

(I Know) [repeated in the background]

([Listen, the soul of this song belongs to God])

Welcome 2 the New Power Generation

Hundalasiliah

Ha na na-sha na na na na na na

But I know love is the only way till my dying day
No - til my dying day I'll be OK
Cuz Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Hundalasiliah

I know there is a devil because he talks so loud
He makes U do things that your friends do, hang out with the crowd
But my Lord he is so quiet when He calls your name
When U hear it your heart will thunder
U will want 2 hear it every day

No! (people) Is what Spooky Electric say (everbody say)
But don't U know that I know
Love is the only way, til my dying day
No - Til my dying day I'll be OK
Cuz Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Hundalasiliah

Yea, Oh, Alphabet Street

One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

Glam Slam thank U ma'am

Glam Slam thank U ma'am

I know I hold U 2 tight
But I just can't seem 2 get close enough (I want to hold U)
I want 2 hold U every night
I'm so horny and U're the star

Glam Slam thank U ma'am

Glam Slam thank U ma'am

Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Baby scam water ripple
I don't understand
It means I love U
Come a butterfly straight on your skin

Glam Slam, thank U ma'am
Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam

Glam Slam, thank U ma'am

This thing we got - it's alive!
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied (ooh, baby)

U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U always stay

Glam Slam
U will always stay
U will always stay

It's all right, it's OK


Have U ever been so lonely
That U felt like U were the
Only one in this world?

Have U ever wanted 2 play
With someone so much U'd take
Any one boy or girl?

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me
Praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way...
So I danced

Music late, nothing great (Music late, nothing great)
No way 2 differentiate (No way 2 differentiate)
I took a chance

Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips 2 say

"We could live 4 a little while
If U could just learn 2 smile
U and I could fly away, fly away."

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me
Praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps U could show me, baby (show me, baby)

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
If I was just closer 2 somethin' (closer)
Closer 2 your higher self
I don't know
Closer 2 heaven (Maybe) closer 2 God (closer to God)

Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget that U are the rule
U are my God, I am Your child
From now on, 4 U I shall be wild
I shall be quick I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story, no matter how long (no matter how... no matter)

We're just a play in Your master plan
Now, my Lord I understand

(I understand)

Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
[repeated over chorus]


Oh, pick it up!
There's a bass guitar in this

Grenade Launcher roars in a television sky
Tell me how many young brothers must die

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

Little Talk Johnny blew the big score
The gang nailed his feet 2 a wooden floor
Nuclear Ban never stays in tune
They all know the words but the music is doomed

Everybody
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Pick it up
Dance on, dance on

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

A bass guitar in spider webs, longing 4 the funk
Uzi gun takes his place in a wagon trunk
(get off me, punk, U ain't sexy)
Stealin' ladies purses then settin' them a'flame
M&M killers playin' Mickey Mouse games

Lord have mercy
Dance on, dance on (Dance on)
Dance on, dance on (Dance on)

It's time 4 new education
The former rules don't apply
We need a power structure that breeds production
Instead of jacks who vandalize
Detroit - what's happenin'?

What color is your money today? [this is sung in a round]
Get your money straight
Everybody dance on


New Power, New Power, give it 2 me
Oh, it need some bottom in here... lay it on me

(hey now, hey now)

Everybody on the block say it is the best
The most vital is what they say, more or less
It put my name upon my thigh
It makes me dance, It makes me cry
And when I touch it race cars burn rubber in my pants

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it - I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Dig me now

Anyone that's ever touched it,
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
And I got 2 tell the world,
I just can't keep it to myself
All in life becomes easier,
No question is unresolved
And I'm not afraid

Come on and touch it, I know U will love it
With it I know that heaven's a butterfly kiss away

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it - I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Lovesexy

Lovesexy

Rain is wet, sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows (Lovesexy)
When love calls, U got 2 go

Lovesexy

Tonight we make love with only words
Girls first, girls first
OK so like first I'll start by telling U how
Intelligent a curve your behind has
And then I can tell U that I can just smell U
And race cars burn rubber in my pants
But I really dig trippin' on the thought of
Being caught by someone with your beauty, style and grace
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
4 just 2 nights with your face
I don't want to make love 2 U
I just want 2 look at U
I just want 2 listen 2 U

Oh, pretty little whip, U got me drippin'
Drippin' all over the floor, the floor
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
A body like yours

Living rooms
I think... I think U would
I think U wanna play house
Yeah, I think U wanna play house

Lovesexy

U don't mind
I think U... uh...
I think U want me to (beep) inside of U
Yea...yeah... I...

U want (Lovesexy) me to s...suck around your living room
Ha Ha
Yeah, U...U want me to walk right down your halls

Mmm hmmm
Lovesexy

U want me to swivel in your love seat
Don't U baby?

U want me to write my name on your walls
U want me to write my name

Lovesexy
We make love with only words
I'll make love to U, tomorrow

Sweet dreams


So fair she looked tonight,
The brightest star appeals to your sex.
Before we do anything,
Let me just talk 2 U.

When 2 R in love
They whisper secrets
Only they 2 can hear
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love (love)
Their stomachs will pound
Every time the other comes near
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love
Falling leaves will appear 2 them
Like slow motion rain (slow motion, slow motion)

When 2 R in love
The speed of their hips
Can be faster than a runaway train

Drop, drop, drop, drop, water, water, water

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
L.o.v.e. - l.o.v. - can U hear me?

When 2 R in love
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
Of penetration (let alone the act)
Let alone the actual act

When 2 R in love
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
In his mind, this thought it leads the pack

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
(Love) in love - can U hear me?

(hold me)
(yeah)
(just like that)
(don't move)


Follow where we go
And when the world's compassion
Ceases still I know
4 your every touch I
Thank U so much
4 your every kiss I...

I wish U love
I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

If I see 11
U can say it's 7
Still I wish U heaven

I wish U love
I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

La la la la la, do do do do do
La la la la la, do do do do do
La la la la la

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

That a life of crime'll help him beat U in the race
Help him beat U in the race (Help him beat U in the race)

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spiritually
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

Razor blades from a paper cup
He can't understand, I say 2 tough
It's just that I've seen the future
And boy it's rough

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So U can't go like a jerk
No, no

I've seen the future and it will be
Wait a minute

Pretty pony standing on the avenue
Flashin' a loaded pistol, 2 dumb 2 be true
Somebody told him playin' cops and robbers was cool
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
If there's life after, we will see
Don't go out like a jerk

Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past

If a man is considered guilty

Then give me the electric chair

It took my mind out like a
G flat major with an E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted to touch your mouth
My brain is jackin' all over the place

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love

That sets us free
Me lovin' U, U lovin' me (me lovin' u, u lovin' me)

The electric chair

Guilty, (4 all my future crimes)

"I'm of the mind to make some mookie.
phonebook..."

The phone rings, it's Vicki callin'
She wants me 2 come 2 the crib
She says conversation's better than being lonely
So I try my best to ad lib
I told the joke about the woman
Who asked her lover "Why is your organ so small?"
He replied "I didn't know I was playin' in a cathedral."
Vicki didn't laugh at all.

[Chorus:]
This is where she wants 2 be
I am what she wants 2 see
I never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting...
Alright

All is well in Gotham City
The sound of terror is all U hear
Sometimes a pistol takes the place of her body
Sometimes her body's here
But U see when crime is your only love
All that matter is the present, the here and now
People, people, whatever floats this joker's boat
Is whatever this joker will bang

[Chorus]

Oh yeah

Talk of children still frightens me
Is my character enough 2 be
One that deserves a copy made?
This I one day, hope 2 see
Until then she's held at bay
By my animal-like persistence
Or maybe she's just 2 proud 2 say
That fate (fate) brought us together
And this is where she wants 2 stay

[Chorus 2x]

All is well in Gotham town
This is where she wants 2 be
I am what she wants 2 see
I've never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting (waiting)
Aha aha

Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting

This is where she wants 2 be


(W,X,Y,Z)
"Hey, it's the man! Yeah, let's see what's going on!"

Trust - who do ya?
Trust - what makes U a real lover?
Trust - I put this question to ya
Cuz I want U 2 be with me

Love - U cannot imagine
How much I want 2 give 2 U
Hot - I get so excited
Just thinkin' about all we could do
Dig it now

Another world awaits us
Another power 2 see
Close - don't worry about nobody else
From now on U'll be here with me

Trust - who do ya?

Dear Dad,
Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them 2
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode

Everybody wanna see u down 4 the count
But that ain't what being a real man's about
The brave and the bold hang around 4 the kill
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it (fill it!)
They can hit us with all they got
But cha know what?
What?

I can't stop this feeling I got
I feel it right down 2 my toes
I can't stop this feeling I got
My body got 2 have it u know
I can't stop this feeling I got
I'll write a letter to the whole world
I can't stop this feeling I got
Every man, woman, boy and girl

Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got

I can't stop this feeling I got
U know I can't sleep at night
I can't stop, u know I love it a lot,
I'm talking about an everlasting light.
I can't stop this feeling I got
I get to shaking all in my shoes
I can't stop this feeling I got
The doctor say there's nothing that he can do

Can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got
Keep on singing now

Can't stop. try 2 tell me how 2 paint my palace,
That ain't where it's at,
That's like trying 2 tell Columbus that the world is flat.
If the song we're singing truely is the best
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test
All in favor say Aye.
We can change anything at all.

I, I, I can't stop. can't stop.
I'm in a butt kicking mood tonight ya'll
Can't stop. can't stop.

Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if u didn't come 2 party child, I think u better get up offa my block.

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting 4.

We're sick and tired of u telling us what 2 do.
Why don't u just be happy, baby.

[chorus repeated with this sung over it]
Go on and get up offa my block
Get up offa my block, because
Love is there if you'd just open up 2 it.
If you'd just believe your whole world would change

New power generation, you've got to rearrange. We've got
We r the new power generation, you've gotta give up all the fight
We gotta try 2 love one another, baby. we r the new power generation

All of the questions in my life will be answered
When I decide which road 2 choose
What is the answer 2 the question of u?

U.


Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
He's looking 4 some action, he's looking 4 a fight
He's looking 4 a saviour in a city full of fools
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking 2.
Can we talk baby? Strip down, strip down.
I think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.

Elephants and flowers, hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls
How can he find a shy angel in a city so bold (so bold)
He can't even find a place 2 dance, this is rock and roll.
Strip down, strip down, elephants and flowers
Is everybody ready? Here we go.

Love the one who is love, (love) the one who gives us the power, (power)
The one who made everything, (what?) elephants and flowers (what will he do?)
The one who will listen when all others will not.
There will be peace 4 those who love god a lot.

Elephants and flowers. Strip down. Think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.
When I do, there won't be no more (confusion)
There won't be no more (no tears)
There won't be no more enemies, so that eliminates all the fear
And there won't be no sorrow, (sorrow)
There won't be no pain, (no pain)
There won't be no ball and no chain
Strip down, strip down. Elephants and flowers.

Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
He's looking 4 an angel to hold him 'til the morning light
Here we go.

Love the one who is love, (well) the one who gives us the power, (power)

Round, round

Can u tell me what it is we really want 2 find?
Is the truth really there? Or is it right under our hair?
4 all we know it's been there all the time.

I say, nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want 2, but the world still goes around and round.
Round and round. We go round and round and round.
And what we're looking 4 still isn't found

Can u tell me when we gonna get 2 it.
I'm tired of fooling around I said I wanna do it. (go 4 it, get 2 it)

Round and round (get get get get 2 it, go 4 it, get 2 it)

And I'll be looking 4 a girl who's pretty
1 day I'll make a play and she will say ok
'cause I plan 2 be a cool kitty

Round and Round.
I say, nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want 2, but the world still goes around and round.
Round and round. We go round and round and round.
And what we're looking 4 still isn't found
Round and round we go. Round and round we go.
Round and round and round and round and round and round we go.

[crowd noise same as for "Alphabet Street"]

He like to frequent this club down up on 36th
Pimps and thangs like 2 hang outside and cuss for kicks

Talking 2 no one in particular, they say "the baddest I am tonight"
4 letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside
Live music from a band plays a song called "Soul Psychodelicide".
The song's a year long and had been playing 4 months when he
Walked into the place.
No one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces.
Up on the mic repeating 2 words, over and over again
Was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the
Articulated manner in which she said them.
These 2 words, a little bit behind the beat.
I mean just enough 2 turn u on.
4 everytime she said the words another one of his doubts were gone.

Should he try 2 rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem 2 care.
So over and over, she said the words til he could take no more, (no more)
He dragged her from the stage and together they ran through the back door
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name
She only said the words again and it started to rain (rain, rain, rain)
2 words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition
Holding someone is truly believing there's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition.
She said love me, love me, what she say?
She say love me, love me.
Joy, why don't u love me baby, joy, why can't u love me baby
Joy, come on and love me baby, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition,
Alright, joy in repetition,
Alright, joy in repetition,
Alright, joy, all my wishes add up to one
Love me, joy, Love me, joy, Love me, joy
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, joy in repetition,
Joy, joy (love me) in repetition,
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,
Joy, I'd like 2 go way up high and say, Love me, joy
I'll say Love me, joy
Joy, joy in repetition, joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition


Love machine, yeah. Hey, yeah.

Vthis love that I've been waiting for, a Love solid as rock
A Love that reaffirms that we R not alone
A Love so bright inside U it glows
And night and day would run together, and all things would b fine
Still would stand all hate around us
Still would stand all time
Still would stand all time

It's not a thousand years away, it's not that far my brother
When men will fight injustice instead of one another
Its not that far if we all say yes and only try
Then Heaven on Earth we will find

No one man will be ruler, therefore love must rule us all
Dishonesty, anger, fear, jealousy and greed will fall
Love can save us all

Oh, love, Love, oh Love if U would just please give us a sign
Still would stand all time
Heaven, heaven on Earth we all want 2 find (we all want 2 find it)
Still (still) would stand all time

Tell me can U see the light (can ya see the light)
If U just open your eyes (still would stand all time)
So much U will know, so much U will show
Love, Love, its not that far away if we all say yes and give it a try
(Got ta give it...a try...yes!) still would stand all time (I say still)
(so many times) so may times, I thought I could not make it

Life was closing in I just knew, I just knew I couldn't take it
That's when Love opened it's arms, and if U dont go in child
Still would stand all time (still would stand all time)
U better run to the light, leave your past behind
All things will be fine
Still would stand all time

And nowhere was the place that I was going (preacher, cmon on)
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed 4 the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top 2 the bottom 2 bottom 2 top
Success is where I'm headed there ain't no doubt
Success is something that we all want
But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's somthing in it that's there 4 u

Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise, somebody
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)}

So remember the truth you cant go wrong
The flesh is weak and the spirit is strong

'cause I did it in the name of Jesus Christ
(cmon somebody lets party tonite)
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)

What she told me then got me so hot
I knew that we could slide

Gett off - 23 positions in a 1 night stand
Gett off - I'll only call u after if u say I can
Gett off - let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - I u want 2 baby here I am (Here I am)

Gett off (Gett off)

1 2 3 - Nah, little cutie, I ain't drinkin' (Gett off)
Scope this, I was just thinkin'
U + me, what a ride
If u was thinkin' the same
We could continue outside (Gett off)
Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter
Strip your dress down
Like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Lemme show u baby I'm a talented boy

Everybody grab a body
Pump it like u want somebody

Gett off (Gett off)

So here we-so here we-so here we are, here we are (G-G-Gett off)
In my paisley crib
Whatcha want 2 eat? "Ribs"
Ha, toy, I don't serve ribs...
U better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when u sat down

Honey them hips is gone
That's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of something James used to say...

"I like 'em fat"
"I like 'em proud"
"Ya gotta have a mother for me"

Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Tonight your a star
And I'm the big dipper

(Kick it)

(Gett off)

(Gett off)

How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve (Gett off)
There's a rumor goin' all round that u ain't been gettin' served (Gett off)
They say that u ain't u know what
In baby who knows how long (Gett off)
It's hard 4 me 2 say what's right
When all I wanna do is wrong

Gett off - 23 positions in a 1 night stand
Gett off - I'll only call u after if u say I can
Gett off - let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - I u want 2 baby here I am

Come on

Gett off
Gett off
Gett off

Walk away from people u meet?
Don't talk 2 strangers

Oh yeah - That's what I'm sayin' (get funky)
That's what I'm sayin'
That's what I'm sayin'

Who turn the mother out?

(That's what I'm sayin')
Tony, you were excellent (That's what I'm sayin')
What you need is a manager (That's what I'm sayin')

For what?
I can make you... Money minders are like parasites
They pose and wheelers and
Dealers for your rights. And most
Companies say that you need em!
Not me... But I've kicked back, observed, and
I'm honest... Watched 'em bleed 'em
Artists young and old
I can bring you to the top! Where'd this unwritten law come from anyway?
That years after the contract you should
Still be gettin' paid? Boy, I go broke
And hit the skids before I take care of
A rich sucker's kids. Hell,
My contract... A contract ain't no pension plan,
My contract... Years after this my kids are still
Gonna make the grand.
Tony, you... And you laugh at my brother Little Richard
When he says you ain't gave him nothing.
Let's leave him out of this Hell, that ain't no joke.
His songs are still sellin', that man
Could die broke. So fellow artists,
U need me... Push for yours, and watch for
Mr. Money Minder, as we settle the score.
Tony...


One more card and it's 22
Unlucky 4 him again
He never had respect 4 money it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never ever has enough
2 treat his lady right
He just pushes her away in a huff
And says 'Money don't matter 2 night'

Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter 2 night

Look, here's a cool investment
They're tellin' him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in ever color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that...

Money don't matter 2 night (don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (soul's alright)
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
And it sure don't matter 2 night

(ooh-wee-ooh, don't matter)
(it don't matter 2 night, no)

Hey now, maybe we can find a good reason
2 send a child off 2 war
So what if we're controllin' all the oil,
Is it worth a child dying 4? (is it worth it?)
If long life is what we all live 4
Then long life will come 2 pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
And u think u got it bad

Money don't matter 2 night (no, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (make certain that your soul's alright)
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
... it sure don't matter 2 night

Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday, yesterday)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter 2 night

I can't have a hug (unless)
Unless I have a kiss

Cuz when it comes 2 u, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I would drink every drop

Cuz I'll surely go crazy
OK, so all u do is push the little red button...

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u
There's no tellin' how far I'd go
Cuz when it comes 2 u, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I would drink every drop

So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
Do u really want all my clothes off? (yes)
What are u gonna do to prove it?
Aren't u afraid we're gonna be found out?
Well, let's get on with the show
Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down lower)
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
Baby knows what 2 do
Have u done this before? (I don't know)
U say u want my hips up in the air? (yeah)
I don't know, I don't care

(My body, baby, u truly do)

(Up and down, just like a seesaw) ((back and forth))
(back and forth)
Listen (oh girl, I'm fallin')

I love u baby, you're mine
U're nastier than I thought
It's just 2:49...


Lauch procedure commence
Countdown start
10,9,8,7,6,5,4

Keep goin'

Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...

30,000 feet and still-a-counting (live 4 love)
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (live 4 love)
They killed my buddy, but I'm supposed to feel nothing (live 4 love)

How can I live 4 love? I'm calling...
Live 4 love
Live 4 love - I'm calling...
Live 4 love - I'm calling...
Live 4 love

Kicked out of my home at 17 (live 4 love) ((get outta here))
A real family,
Now what does that mean (what does that mean) (live 4 love)
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen (live 4 love)

How can I live 4 love? I'm calling...
Live 4 love
Live 4 love
Live 4 love - Calling, I'm calling
Live 4 love

My mission, so they said, was just 2 drop the bombs
Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...
Just like I got no conscience, just like I got no qualms
Alpha 7, acknowledge
Now what does that mean?

Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go

So here, my target is approaching
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching

"Live 4 Love, without love u don't live"

Boom - I take a deep breath
Is it boom - life?
Is it boom - death?

(live 4 love)

Maybe I was better off staying in school (live 4 love)
But everybody said flying planes was cool (live 4 love)
It's so easy 4 them 2 say
Cuz they never have to go through

How can I live 4 love? (live 4 love) I'm calling
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Live 4 love
Live 4 love (live 4 love)
Live 4 love
Live 4 love

Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live 4 love)
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishin' (live 4 love)
The choice u make is vital
So at the end of my recital
I say - U got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)

Keep goin'

Live 4 love
Live 4 love (live 4 love)
Live 4 love (live 4 love)

(live 4 love), (live 4 love)
Live (live 4 love)

Live 4 love, without love u don't live
And how u make it is based on what you're givin' back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations,
The cards have always been stacked against us (live 4 love)
2 love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Beleive me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And gangk any clown who ain't down
With the colors that u're sportin' 'round
Listen G, u are supposed 2 be strivin'
2 be the best that u can be
So stop tryin' 2 dominate and push and shove (live 4 love)
C'mon y'all, we got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)

(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)

(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only
I did not come 2 funk around
'Tll I get your daughter I won't leave this town
In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string
My God was worried 'til he heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me

(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hurt me (Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous I know from sin
I got 2 sides and they both friends
Don't try 2 clock 'em, they're much too fast
If u try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When u hear my music you'll be havin' fun
That's when I gottcha that's when u mine
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me (You can't stop Prince)

(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody) (Prince)

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
Cuz I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came 2 day?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than u
But if u want 2 play with me, u better learn the rules

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
I did not come 2 funk around (You can't stop Prince)
'Till I get your daughter I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this - leave this - leave this

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody)

Hurt me (Do that, do that, some....)

The funkier I be
The funkier I get, oh shit
Lickety split on the lyric
A new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this u're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak
When you jumped on my D.I.C.K.
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was 2 big 4 u anyway
U're just a simpleton
I'll bust u like a pimple, son
My star is 2 bright
Boy, I'll sink u like the ship Poseidon Adventure
U're bumpin' dentures 2 be cocksure
There must be more coming from
Your mouth than manure.
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey
U must become a prince before u're king anyway

(Do that, do that somebody)
(Do that, do that somebody)

It's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on
U've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'
In my cauldron. That means my nugget...
Sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin'
The other brothers buggin' and this is 4 those who oppose
And propose 2 overexpose disclose
Pose a threat 2 my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let u play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do u expect 2 win when u're used to playing craps?

(Do that, do that somebody)
Hell yeah, let's get this under the hmm...
(Do that, do that somebody)

"Damn." It's gettin' tricky
I mean it's a sticky situation
2 resurrect a groove with feeling
And give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, and it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party
While u're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
2 layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome
And I'm out...

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only

My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince

He realized that she was new 2 love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fanstasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the oceanside
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers

Let me play it for u one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks

Why is age more than a number when it comes 2 love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Somebody help me sing it now

La-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Where are u?
U can relax now, the Max is in control
Go... yeah yeah

When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
When half a chance is all I get if I get a chance at all
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
The max - We can dance if u want 2, but I might break yo back
The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that

When they tell me 2 walk a straight line
I put on crooked shoes
When they tell me that I can't live forever
I pay some overdues (Kick it)
When they start makin' up a crazy rule
That's when I break a back
Cuz when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby (oh yeah), tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (oh, yeah yeah)
The max - We can dance if u want 2 (ooh yeah), but I might break yo back

The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Oh, yeah yeah!

(Dig it) When my body starts to shiver from the chill of
The scarlett sweat
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon
Reflecting from the wet
When the blood of my love outraces
Every one of the stallions in your pack - that's when
U go, u go, u go 2 the max. U go

The max (2 the max)
The max (oooh, get funky)
The max (get-get-get funky) (2 the max)

Then listen -
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack
The max - We can dance if u want 2, but I might break yo back
The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that

This is the max

Dear love, dear love, dear love
Forgive me 4 my sins

If u go there once u

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die
All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (1,2,3,4 - 1,2,3,4)
But behold, we will watch them fall

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright, (that's alright)
4 I will watch them fall(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

[(Just how old)]

And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
4 in the distance, 12 souls from now
U and me will still be here - we will still be here

There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a, there will be no death 4 with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

(Just how old)
(Just how old)
(Just how old)


In a deep sleep I fell
And the music starts 2 swell
One of my ribs He took and it shall be
Bone of my bones (bone of my bones)
And God created woman
And we were naked and did not care
There's a time 2 take and a time 2 share
2 in love, all around and all aware
Flesh of my flesh (flesh of my flesh)
And God created woman

Temptation sweet and so much (sweet and so much)
Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch (shall ye touch)
Then again we could die from the rush (rush)
Heart of my heart (heart of my heart)
And God created woman (woman)

Woman
My-my-my-my-my-my woman

In my darkest hour I find
Many serpents who have lied (lied)
Given half the chance still I'd run 2 your side (run 2 your side)
Love of my love (love of my love)
And God created woman (woman)

And if I never see u again
It's alright 4 I am guilty of no sin
They can have u, I'll have your love in the end
Soul of my soul (soul of my soul)
And God created woman

(God created woman)
(God created woman) (woman)
Flesh of my flesh
(God created woman) (soul)
(God created, God created woman)
(God created, God created woman)
(God created woman)


If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life
U say u'll call me and then and then u don't
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Coupled with the fact that u belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date
With the undertaker, which one will it be?
U can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

Give back the chains - if you don't you will die
Nothing should come between you and I

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
If one of us has 2 go
U will go before me

If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me
(3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me, baby (they will shine 4 ever)
Cuz I sho 'nuff say u will

(3 chains o' gold)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)

I've got 3 chains o' gold
They gonna shine...

Forever, forever, forever

(3 chains o' gold)

1967 in a bus marked public schools
Rode me and a group of unsuspecting political tools
Our parents wondered what it was like 2 have another color near
So they put their babies together 2 eliminate the fear
We sacrifice yes we did
Fighting one another, (we sacrifice) (don't say it preacher)
All because of color
The angel of hate - she taught me how 2 kick her
If she called me anything but Victor (u mean like nigger?)
If the only thing that tells me is father time
Then sacrifice is the mutha sublime - we love it

Listen mutha - we sacrifice

Hold yo' text, deacon

Never understood my old friends laughing
They got high when everything else got wrong (pass the booze up here)
Dr. King was killed and the streets
They started burnin'
When the smoke was cleared, their high was gone
Education got important, so important 2 Victor
A little more important than ripple and weed
Bernadette's a lady, and she told me (what she say?)
"Whatever u do son, a little discipline is what u need,

Music is the key 2 set yourself free
From depression, drugs and increasing poverty
The key is 2 the lock, the lock is on the door
The door has a knob that u've never turned before
The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock
Cuz there's the key 2 unlock the body
Place it like that 2 open up the door
The door 2 the house full of people galore
The beat won't stop 'til the JM jocks
And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot
And believe it or not, all the troubles u forgot
It's just that easy if u want it 2 be
For all the fellas, and the young ladies
So ease your mind and set yourself free
2 the mystifying music that we call Cindy C

Oh Cindy C, won't u play with me?
Oh Cindy C


Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway
I turned on my radio 2 hear some music play
I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead
And the only good rapper is one that's dead on it

Uh, Dead on it

Shall we go back? (Yeah!)
Let's go

Negros from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good
But the ones from Minneapolis play it like it oughta should
A magnum fro is better when u got a poof on it
And the 2 and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it

(Funky dead on it)
uh, dead (on it) on it

Shall we go back? Let's go

They dead on it, wow

See the rapper's problem usually stem from being tone deaf
Pack the house then try 2 sing,
there won't be no one left (ha ha) (on it)
Parking lot's on fire, brothers peelin' out of the town
They say in disgust, they singin' their guts
Rappin' done let us down (down down)
u got 2 be dead... on it

Dead on it

(dead)

All the sisters like it when u lick 'em on the knees
Don't believe me? (no)
Try it once then stop, they'll be begging
Please, please, please (please, please, please)
Shoo be doo wa, dead on it
What does that have 2 do with the funk?
Nothing, but who's paying the bills?
If u don't wanna lick my knees, I'm sho' your mama will

Uh, cuz we, cuz we, cuz we dead on it

De, de- de- de- de- de- de, dead on it, on it

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

My bed's a coffin, Dracula ain't got shit on me
My nickname's Hell's-a-Poppin', I'm badder than the Wicked Witch
I got a gold tooth, costs more than your house
I got a diamond ring on four fingers, each one the size of a mouse

They dead, they dead on it, on it

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Dead on it, on it, on it

So fair she looked tonight,
The brightest star appeals to your sex.
Before we do anything,
Let me just talk 2 U.

When 2 R in love
They whisper secrets
Only they 2 can hear
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love (love)
Their stomachs will pound
Every time the other comes near
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love
Falling leaves will appear 2 them
Like slow motion rain (slow motion, slow motion)

When 2 R in love
The speed of their hips
Can be faster than a runaway train

Drop, drop, drop, drop, water, water, water

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
L.o.v.e. - l.o.v. - can U hear me?

When 2 R in love
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
Of penetration (let alone the act)
Let alone the actual act

When 2 R in love
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
In his mind, this thought it leads the pack

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
(Love) in love - can U hear me?

(hold me)
(yeah)
(just like that)
(don't move)

They're, they're musicians

2 nigs united 4 West Compton [x2]


Does anybody know you're here?
This house of ill-repute (Ooohh honey I'm scared of u)
Tryin' 2 deal with all your fears
I guess this is what u get 4 being cute (Cute, cute)
Soaked in banana cologne
No wonder you're all alone
It's written all over your face
You're just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place

Here comes a lady so u cover up
She's a freaked out,
Funky electric mama with double cups
Say u, u could cop if u wanted 2
Because something near your leg
Is haunting u, such a disgrace
U're rock hard in a funky place, ow!

Rock hard in a funky place

U was workin' on the line
U could drop on her
But u couldn't concentrate
When your dick saw her
Maybe if u cop a nut in the car (Maybe if u cop a nut in the car)
Maybe u could think
About playing guitar

(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
Oh yeah

Rock hard in a funky place

All you're looking 4 is love
Or a reason 2 believe there's a God above
Pretty soon you'll get enough
And head back 2 a life so tough
I just hate 2 see an erection go 2 waste
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place
Say it
Rock hard in a funky place
Rock hard in a funky place
Oohh U rock hard in a funky place
U rock hard in a funky place
Say it, y'all

(rock, rock)
what? (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We gotta go, y'all
tune in next week (rock, rock)
Same time (rock, rock)
same boogie (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock hard)
oohhh yeah (rock, rock, rock, rock)
we will rock, y'all (rock, rock)

But until then keep your finger on the trigger
That's the only way it'll get bigger

(What kind of fuck ending was that?)

I never been 1 2 hide my feelings
Baby, u blow my mind
I painted your face upon my ceiling
I stare at it all the time

Oh I imagine myself in your sky

(Oh u) U are the reason I'm high

If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make u understand

Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush

But just keep your eye on my hips

Just say the word and I'll strip

I've had dreams of us cuddling on the planet mars
Then when i wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex

If u and I were just ten feet closer

Come
Lie down beneath my shadow
Lie down beneath my shadow with great delight
And your feel will be sweet 2 me
Come
My left hand under your head,
While my right embraces time
Therein, my virgin, love's wine

L is 4 lust
O is 4 obsession
V is 4 the vast way u envelop my soul
This is crazy, this is crazy
I could die from the pheromone

I can see the castle
I can see the throne
I can see the beloved and she's not alone
But it's cool like that
Cuz I'll be diggin' her just the same
I can see the curtain wrestled from the wall
I can see her hands tied
I can see it all
He pulls a gat
This is how they play the game
And I'm 'round the the back
Cuz curiosity it knows no shame

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

I can feel the tension through the crack in the door
He begs 4 love, while she's disgusted more
And I'm on fire, cause I never seen her nude before
I wanna save her (save her)
I want 2 watch (watch)
All my vital signs go up a couple of notches
When he unties her and she runs 2 the open door
He trips and grinds her (grinds her)
Right there all on the floor (on the floor)
She so close I can touch her (touch her)

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet (body's wet, body's wet, body's wet)

Her eyes are closed but there's no penetration
He just makes her point the pistol 2 his nose
While he masturbates and now I see a tear
Heading down towards her smile
What happens next it all depends upon your style

(Oh, this is crazy baby)

Pheromone, (Pheromone) rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, (Pheromone) controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, (Pheromone) when your body's wet (body's wet)
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion

I don't really wanna go crazy but I'm helpless as a pet
When I see your naked body's wet (when your body's wet,body's wet)
(Pheromone) When I see your naked body's wet
(Pheromone) When I see your naked body's wet (body's wet, body's wet)

There was 1 September day that Papa worked 2 hard
First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
Then he screamed at baby twice 4 throwin' rocks at passin' cars
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
He got snatched by his Papa who then opened up the closet door
And pushed the four-year-old down, onto the closet floor
Baby cried "I'm sorry, I won't do it no more"
Papa said "Yeah, I know, that's what this here's 4"
Smack!
Ooh Papa...
Smack! Smack!
Ooh Papa...Papa...
Smack!
Ooh Papa...
Smack! Smack!
Ooh Papa...Papa...

As the door closes, baby starts 2 cry
"Please don't lock me up again, without a reason why"
Papa just went outside and pointed a shotgun up in the sky
He said "How come I don't love my woman?"
Then he took aim and died

Boom!
Papa...
Boom! Boom!
Papa...Papa
Boom!
Papa...
Boom! Boom!
Papa...Papa...

Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me

Fair 2 partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Every single 1 of us knows some kind of pain
In the middle of all that's crazy, this 1 fact still remains
If u love somebody, your life won't be in vain
And there's always a rainbow, at the end of every rain


Lie down, fair 1, and come away
Till the rain is over and gone
G-G-Gimme the beat now (Face the music)
Lead line (Face the music)

If the air is a little thick in this room 2nite
I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Overcome by this colorful sight

Talkin' so fast that even they
Talkin' so fast that even they
Don't know what they mean

Of all the things that base a rhyme
How is it that U everytime
Regurgitate the racist lines that keep us apart?

Thank God this ain't Monopoly
U'd make us all go back 2 start

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race

Check it

Three seats over there's a lady black
Entrusted 2 her care is a little white girl
And the fact of the matter is

Before her momma or another kid at school
Tells her about the fallacy that 1 race rules over the other
She'd be a much-better-off-left fool (Face the music)

If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Then how my dear, tell me now how my dear, tell me now how now would we know

And then the band say

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race

D-d-down with H-I-S-T-O-R-Y and all this BS propagandi
Keepin U from me and me from U as we grow
I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
Why those before us hated each other

I'd rather believe they never did
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
That there's hope 4 a kid

And if he imitates the best
I guess that's what I'll try 2 be
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea

Race

Face the music (Face the music)

I wanna top the rose petals that whisper sweet
Come on
So dark, dark, so dark
So dark, dark, so dark

Inside lookin' out my window
I don't see nothin' but rain
Sun up in the sky just a shinin' (just a shinin')
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain

Like an innocent man that's on death row
I don't understand what made u go
And wanna leave me baby
Leave me in the dark

Can u tell me, tell me?

U took my sex and my money (money)
Took all my self esteem, yes u did
U had the nerve 2 think it was funny (funny)
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir

U absolutely drove a man 2 tears
All I really know is that u sincerely
U wanna hurt me baby, oh yes u do
U wanna hurt me in the dark

(Sunshine) Somebody make the sun shine
(Dark cloud) Somebody take this dark cloud away

Just as sure as Noah built the ark
That's how sure
That's how sure I am u broke my heart

How could u baby, leave me in the dark?
Baby, so dark
So dark, dark, so dark
Feel like the sun ain't never gonna shine
U left me in the dark
So dark, dark, so dark
I don't know, I don't know why we ever had 2 part
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window it's so dark (so dark)
(So dark, dark, so dark)

Sometimes I want 2 curse the ground u walk on
Even when I know that everything u feel I feel it 2
I wanna curse u baby
U left me in the dark
And now I want 2, I wanna curse u baby
4 leavin' me alone, alone, alone
U left me in the dark, yes u did

And now all I wanna say is
In the dark
Ow, u left me
Ow, u left me
It's like being on death row (In the dark)
I don't understand why u had 2 go
I don't understand why u (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why u (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why u hurt me (hurt me, hurt me)
Hurt me (hurt me in, hurt me in)
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me (hurt me in the dark)
Just leave me
In the dark

In the dark
So dark, dark, so dark (In the dark)
So dark, dark, so dark

So low, the curb looks like a skyscraper
So high, the stars are under me
So quiet, I can hear the blood rushing through my veins
So low, I feel like I'm going insane
The angels, they watch in wonder
When U made love 2 me
Through the rain and the thunder
U cried in ecstacy

And U were so kind
I felt sorry 4 all creation
Because at the time, no 1 was lucky
no 1 was lucky, no 1 was lucky as me

And now U're gone and I just wanna be still
So silent, I'll just let my senses sleep

It's gonna be so hard 2 hear my voice
If I ever learn once more 2 speak

I'm so lost, no 1 can find me
And I've been looking 4 so long
But now I'm done
I'm so low, solo, my name is no-one


Ready or not, here I come
(Come on)
(Come on)
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason 2 let somebody know
Lover here, lover there - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let my feelings show
(letitgo)
I'm ready 4 the real
Give me something I can feel

All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except 4 me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let my feelings show
I, I'm ready 4 the real
Give me something I can feel

4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
Said I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the feelings show

I am ready 4 the real (Come a little closer)

(letitgo)
(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)


Come on

Don't be shy, it's only U and I
Isn't that what U want?

Nuestra presentacion especial comenzara en breve
(Our special presentation will start shortly)
Pero antes un mensaje de nuestros auspiciadores
(But first a message from our sponsors)
Uh, yeah
Uh

Good mornin' ladies and gentlemen ("What hotel number is she in?")
Boys and motherfuckin' girls ("319, 319" "Cool")
This is your captain with no name speakin'
And I'm here 2 rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman U already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat 4 some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did 2 the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work 4 free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, U need Pussy Control'" (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Verse 2
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more Schick than a Bic
'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said "Nigga, U crazy if U don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
U can go platinum 4 times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody wanna hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know
Boy, U better act like U understand
When U roll with Pussy Control" (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Breakdown
(Are U ready 4 the best Pussy U ever felt?) [x2]

With one more verse 2 the story
I need another piece of your ear
I wanna hip U all 2 the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rollin' 4-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said "Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that U're here
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that U're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be
But it's gonna be hard as hell
2 keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!)
Can I tell U what I'm thinkin' that U already know?
U need a motherfucker that respects your name"
Now say it, Pussy Control (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make'em act like they know
U are, was, and always will be Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Peace and be wild (Aaah, Pussy Control)

Say what, huh? (Oh)
Oh no, don't U think about callin' her a ho (Are U ready?)
U juvenile delinquent
Best sit your ass down
Talkin' about Pussy Control
Huh, can U dig it?

Aaah, Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Oh (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Oh (Are U ready?)

Yeah, go baby (Go baby)

Tippy, tippy, tin my friend or shall we begin?
Step right up and I'll strap U in
Don't be shy, this won't hurt a bit
Unless of course U don't believe in it
As sure as the dippy dippy wave of my 'do
U'll believe in somethin' before this night is through
Press one 4 the money, press 2 4 the dream
And get ready 4 somethin' that U've never seen
The Endorphinmachine

Go baby

Tommy Barbarella, turn it on

Uh huh, uh huh
Hold up, wait a minute
Ain't no good unless somebody else is in it
U there with the cynical disposition
Perhaps U'd like 2 join us in a mission
Of fishin' 4 logic in a think tank
Unless, of course, U're feelin' like a punk and take the bank
But every now and then there comes a time U must defend
Your right 2 die and live again, live again, live again
Get up, get up, get in
The Endorphinmachine

It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Don't be shy (The Endorphinmachine)
Yeah, I ain't gonna hurt U

He said it, she said it and I say...

Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend?
Would U let me in?

But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim

After a month of just bein' alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinkin'"
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinkin'
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least 4 2night
When she co-signed and then told him she was ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Oh baby (Shy)

After a look much louder than words she said, "I passed my initiation
A friend of mine, he got killed and in retaliation
I shot the boy ("Pop! Pop!"), huh, twice in the head
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm goin' back 2morrow 2 make sure he's dead
Cuz if I don't, they'll call me a chicken, but U can call me ... "

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Shy

Shy - Lips say no but the body say might
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home..
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home..
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

The girl was rough, but he called her bluff
And he told her not 2 know was better
Fact or fiction he wondered
And that's when the rain and thunder got wetter
And at the top of the page he wrote ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

(Oh, say it now, yeah)
(Shy, shy!)
(Shy)

Ooh baby, don't U wanna be alone 2night?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night


Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
(Bitch) [Fishbone's "Lyin' Ass Bitch" sample repeats throughout song]
What if I called U silly names
Just like the ones that U call me?
What if I filled your eyes with tears
So many that U cannot see?

Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)

(Billy Jack Bitch)

What if I told U that U're worth
Only half of what U be?
Would U come forth and tell no lies?
Would U come forth and talk 2 me?

Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)

(Billy Jack Bitch)

What distortion could U let your pen forget 2day?
What misfortune left your heart so broken U only say
Words intended 2 belittle or dismay?
What if I say U lie?
Billy Jack Bitch (Well)

Open letters aren't the only things that open wounds
Long hard shiny rocket ships can fly U 2 the moon

Whenever evil wants 2 groove
Come let me fly U 2 the moon
Then U can see how love will bloom
Joy - it's in the dictionary
See "J" Billy Jack Bitch

Do U ever really cry? (Do U ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do U ever really try? (Do U ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do U ever wonder why? (Do U ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?)
Oh, Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)

Y'all some tight motherfuckers


U have just accessed the Hate Experience
Do U wish 2 change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience
I never thought that U would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
U gave your body 2 another in the name of fun
I hope U had some baby, if not, boo hoo

It's so sad but I hate U like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate U - Now everyday would be a waste of time
Cuz I hate U

I never thought that I could feel this way
2 fall in love was a table reserved 4 fools
Say U're sorry if U wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through

It's so sad but I hate U like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate U - Now everyday would be a waste of time
Cuz I hate U

This court is now in session
Would the defendant please rise?
State your name 4 the court
Never mind (Billy Jack Bitch)
U're being charged with one 2 many counts of heartbreaking
In the 1st degree
I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is U and me

Your honor, may I call 2 the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well she didn't have no damn business
I know what U did, how U did it and uh.. who U did it with
So U might as well plead guilty cuz U sure can't plead the 5th
Now raise your right hand
Do U swear 2 tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like U used 2 so help U God?
Nod your head one time if U hear me
If U don't, I'll have 2 use the rod
Anything 2 make U see that uh.. U're gonna miss me
Yeah, U're gonna miss me
Uh, uh, uh, oh!

If it please the court
I'd like 2 have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used 2 be
I want it 2 be so good she falls back in love with me

Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want U 2 pump your hips like U used 2
And, baby, U better stay on the beat
Did U do 2 your other man the same things that U did 2 me?
Right now I hate U so much I wanna make love until U see
That it's killin' me, baby, 2 be without U
Cuz all I ever wanted 2 do was 2 be with U ... ow!

I hate U (I hate U)
Because I love U (Because I love U)
But I can't love U (I can't love U)
Because I hate U (I hate U)

Because I love U
I love U, baby
I love U [x3]

I love U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
I hate U because I love U
