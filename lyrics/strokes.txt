
Can't you see I'm trying?
I don't even like it. I just lied to
Get to your apartment, now I'm staying
Here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this... it?

Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable children
Trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind them

Oh dear, can't you see? It's them it's not me
We're not enemies; We just disagree
If I was like him all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree
I think we should disagree, yeah

Is this it
Is this it
Is this it

Can't you see I'm trying?
I don't even like it. I just lied to
Get to your apartment, now I'm staying
Here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired


Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story a long time ago
Stop to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending
Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go, oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leavin' just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So I'll pretend I'm leaving

Our fears are different here
We train in A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now, but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties
Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go
Darling let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time
Staying for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So this is why I'm leaving


Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racing against sun beams
Losing against their dreams
In your eyes

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes

Let's go

When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there", he says
Then he walks out
Somehow he was trying
Too hard to be like them

Well I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling, let me go

Tried it once and they like it
Then tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doing this 25 years"
But I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah
Oh, but that's it


I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck

I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make sense
Those strange manners, I loved 'em so
"Why won't you wear your new trench coat?"

I should've worked much harder
I should've just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
Something that you learned yesterday

"Drive you to work; you'll be on time
These little problems they're not yours and mine,"
"Come on and listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay"

I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothin' I wanted, but...
I want it all
I just can't figure out...
Nothing

And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, you're a freak"
"They ordered me to make mistakes"
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
For the record it's between you and I

Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck

I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it just don't make any sense
Those strange manners, I loved 'em so
"Why won't you wear your new trench coat?"

I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but...
I want it all
I just can't figure out...
Nothin'

And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, I can wait"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
And for the record, it's between you and I


In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes

When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darlin', your head's not right
See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes

Oh, someday...

No, I ain't wastin' no more time

And now my fears
They come to me in threes
So, I
Sometimes
Say, "Fate my friend,
You say the strangest things
I find, sometimes"

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Say I will try my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darlin', your head's not right
See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes

Oh, someday...

I ain't wasting no more time


No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up
I gave up
Lisa says, "Take time for me"
Dropping him down to his knees
Ah, chest down...

Take me away
See I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much"
Makes me drink just the same

People tried. Felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice...

He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then in dollars makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over but I don't care
'Cause

I am with you
Now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
"You drink too much"
Makes me drink just the same

The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last

We all like it a little different...
