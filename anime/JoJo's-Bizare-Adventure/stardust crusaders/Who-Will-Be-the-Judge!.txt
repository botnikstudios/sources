Joseph: That's a hundred-year-old coffin 
pulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,
Joseph: off the African coast four years ago.
Jotaro: Coffin?
Joseph: After I obtained and researched it,
Joseph: I found out that it was on the 
boat where my grandfather,
Joseph: the man four generations before you,
Jonathan Joestar, died.
Joseph: It was apparently empty 
when they discovered it.
Joseph: But I know exactly what was inside!
Joseph: Avdol and I are trying to 
locate him as we speak.
Joseph: He is evil incarnate!
Joseph: His name is DIO!
Joseph: He has awakened from his hundred-year sleep.
Joseph: We are fated to fight him!
Joseph: And on the back of his neck...
Joseph: From this bastard's neck down,
Joseph: is the body of my grandfather, 
Jonathan Joestar,
Joseph: which that bastard has taken over!
Holly: Jotaro! Wait!
Holly: You forgot something!
Holly: Goodness...
Holly: Here, a goodbye kiss.
Holly: Smooch.
Jotaro: You bitch...
Jotaro: Stop clinging to your child already.
Holly: Okay! Have a good day!
Jotaro: Good grief...
girl 1: Hey, it's Jojo.
girl 2: What? Jojo?
girl 3: You're right! It's Jojo!
girl 4: Jojo!
girl 5: Jojo!
girl: Good morning, Jojo.
girl 2: Good morning, Jojo.
girl 3: Jojo!
girl 4: Good morning, Jojo.
girl 5: Jojo, what were you doing while you 
were absent from school for four days?
girl: Hey!
girl: Why are you clinging to Jojo's arm like that?
girl: You're being too chummy! Stay away from him!
girl 2: What the hell, ugly?
girl: Shut it, no-boobs.
girl 2: Ugly.
girl: No-boobs.
girl 2: Ugly.
girl: No-boobs.
girl 2: Ugly.
girl: No-boobs.
girl: Ugly, ugly, ugly...
girl 2: No-boobs, no-boobs, no-boobs...
Jotaro: Shut up! You're damn annoying!
girl 2: He totally said that to me!
girl: No, that was for me!
girl: Jojo, wait!
girl: Wait for us!
girl: Jojo!
Jotaro: What?!
girl: Jojo!
girl: Jojo!
girl: Jojo!
Jotaro: The tree branches...
girl: Jojo!
girl: Oh, no!
girl: Jojo fell down the stairs!
girl: Oh, but he's moving.
girl: The tree branches must have broken his fall!
Jotaro (internal): Did the tree branches cut my leg?
Jotaro (internal): No...
Jotaro (internal): It was already cut before I fell!
Jotaro (internal): That's why I fell down the stairs. 
There's no doubt about it.
Jotaro (internal): But...
girl: Jojo!
girl: Are you all right?
Kakyoin: Oh?
Kakyoin: He's able to summon a pretty strong Stand.
Kakyoin: I see...
Kakyoin: No wonder he wants me to get rid of him.
Kakyoin: But...
Kakyoin: He is no match for my Stand.
girl: You really scared me.
girl: Are you okay, Jojo?
girl: Are you okay, Jojo?
girl: You're really lucky.
If you were even fifteen centimeters off, 
you would have hit the flagstone.
girl: Accidents happen all the time on these steps.
girl: Starting tomorrow, you should 
hold my hand when you go down, Jojo.
guy: You
guy: seem to have cut your left leg.
Kakyoin: You should use this handkerchief 
as an emergency binding.
Kakyoin: Are you all right?
Jotaro: Yeah. It's just a scratch.
Jotaro: Hold it.
Jotaro: Thanks.
I haven't seen you around before. 
Do you go to our school?
Kakyoin: I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.
Kakyoin: I just transferred here yesterday.
Kakyoin: Nice to meet you.
girl: Huh...
girl: Huh...
girl: Huh...
girl: He said his name was Kakyoin.
He's not bad.
girl: Really?
girl: I still like Jojo better.
girl: Me, too.
girl: Me, too.
girl: What?
girl: What are you talking about?
girl: Give it up.
girl: I'm the best for Jojo.
DIO: At the time, I was weakened...
DIO: Because I was only a head.
DIO: If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's body...
DIO: If I didn't have his energy,
DIO: I would have had very little.
DIO: I never could have survived at the bottom 
of the ocean for a hundred years.
DIO: But this body itself is like a 
bond between parent and child,
DIO: and it seems to connect with his descendants.
DIO: They are aware of my existence.
DIO: The new power that I have acquired 
by obtaining Jonathan's body...
DIO: The Stand!
DIO: This Stand also affects the 
bodies of his descendants.
DIO: Advantages and disadvantages
come hand in hand. That is inevitable.
DIO: I must eliminate them...
DIO: I must eradicate Jonathan's family.
Joseph: What's the deal with this cramped room?
Joseph: This is why I hate Japan.
Joseph: Avdol, how can you stand this?
Avdol: It is quite fascinating...
Avdol: This thing they call "the tea ceremony."
Joseph: Tea ceremony, nothing.
Joseph: Instant coffee is plenty good!
Avdol: By the way, about DIO...
Avdol: Mr. Joestar, now that we know of his existence,
Avdol: wouldn't it be safe to assume 
that he knows about us, as well?
Joseph: Indeed. But if we don't 
know what he's going to do,
Joseph: or even know what his powers are...
Joseph: Japanese coffee tastes terrible!
Avdol: That's American coffee.
lady: Jojo, how did you get that cut?
lady: You didn't get into another fight, did you?
lady: And take off your hat!
lady: It's poor manners!
lady: For pity's sake...
guy: Sensei, has Jojo ever gotten hurt in a fight?
guy: There's no way that would happen.
guy 2: Yeah!
lady: Well, you've got a point.
lady: Then I guess I'll believe that 
you just fell, you scatterbrain.
Jotaro: Hey, hold on.
Jotaro: What are you trying to do?
lady: I'm cutting your pants.
Jotaro: Like hell you are.
lady: Well, I can't treat you through them.
Jotaro: I'll take them off.
Cutting them is a waste.
lady: You're surprisingly stingy.
lady: Now then, while Jojo is taking off his pants,
lady: I'll take your temperatures and 
prove that you're faking ill.
guy: We really have colds.
guy 2: Yeah. Let us go home early.
lady: Nope!
Whoops.
Jotaro: What is this?
note: Jotaro Kujo, I will kill you today 
with my Stand! â€”Noriaki Kakyoin
Jotaro: K-Kakyoin?
guy: Hey... S-Sensei!
guy: What are you doing?!
lady: What does it look like?
lady: I'm waving around the 
thermometer to reset it.
guy: Th-Thermometer? Sensei...
guy: Sensei, that's a pen!
lady: A pen? Did you say a pen?!
lady: Does this look like a pen to you?!
lady: How... How stupid can you be?
lady: This thermometer actually 
looks like a pen to you?!
lady: Then have a...
lady: better...
lady: look!
Jotaro: She's...
guy: My eye! My eye!
lady: Jojo...
lady: You're not going to say
lady: that this looks like a pen, are you?!
Jotaro: How is she so strong?
Jotaro: This isn't a woman's strength.
Jotaro: I saw something unknown 
crawling up from the floor earlier.
Jotaro: Was it a Stand?
Jotaro: Noriaki Kakyoin...
Jotaro: Was he the one who cut my leg on the stairs?
Kakyoin: Precisely.
Jotaro: Y-You're...
Kakyoin: Hey. Short time no see.
Kakyoin: My Stand's possessed that 
nurse and is controlling her.
Kakyoin: Attacking my Stand will
mean hurting that nurse, Jojo.
Jotaro: You bastard... Just who the hell are you?!
Kakyoin: I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.
Kakyoin: The name of my Stand is Hierophant Green.
Kakyoin: I am human, but my loyalty is to him...
Kakyoin: Therefore...
Kakyoin: I shall kill you!
Jotaro: I won't hurt her.
Jotaro: Now that I've dragged it out... I see...
Jotaro: It's just a sleazy Stand that can't 
do anything but possess people.
Jotaro: Kakyoin, this is your Stand?
Jotaro: All green and striped...
It looks like a shiny melon.
Kakyoin: You're going to regret
Kakyoin: dragging that out of her, Jojo.
Jotaro: Don't try to act tough.
Jotaro: I can see my finger marks on your forehead.
Jotaro: If I go ahead and crush your 
Stand's head like a melon,
Jotaro: it looks like your head will be crushed, too.
Jotaro: I'm gonna keep a grip on you for a while.
Jotaro: I'll take you to the old man.
Jotaro: I'm sure he'd love to meet you...
Jotaro: And I'd like to know more about DIO myself.
Jotaro: What?
Jotaro: Green fluid is coming out of his Stand's hands?
Kakyoin: I already told you, Jojo...
Kakyoin: That you would regret this.
Kakyoin: Feel the attack of my Stand, Hierophant Green!
Jotaro: Don't make any weird moves!
Kakyoin: Emerald Splash!
Kakyoin: What do you think?
Kakyoin: Emerald Splash...
Kakyoin: What looked like the bodily fluids 
of my Stand, Hierophant Green,
Kakyoin: was a vision of destructive energy!
Kakyoin: It's pierced through your Stand's chest.
Kakyoin: Therefore, your insides 
have been torn to shreds.
Kakyoin: And that nurse...
Jotaro: Wh-What?
Jotaro: I'm certain that I removed the Stand from her...
Kakyoin: I already told you...
Kakyoin: Attacking my Hierophant Green 
would mean hurting her.
Kakyoin: My Stand can reach further than yours, 
but it doesn't like open spaces.
Kakyoin: It prefers to hide within something.
Kakyoin: If you drag it out, it gets angry.
Kakyoin: That's why, when it came out 
from her throat, it hurt her.
Kakyoin: It's your fault, Jojo!
Kakyoin: This is your responsibility!
Kakyoin: This is your fault, Jojo!
Kakyoin: You did this!
Kakyoin: If you had let me kill you in the first place, 
this nurse wouldn't have been hurt.
Kakyoin: You're trying to stand up?
Kakyoin: But how sad...
Kakyoin: If I were to compare you to something,
it'd be a sandbag in front of of a boxer.
Kakyoin: You stood back up only to be hit again.
Jotaro: I, Jotaro Kujo,
Jotaro: am labeled a punk.
Jotaro: I tend to overdo it with my opponents in fights,
Jotaro: so much that some are still in the hospital.
Jotaro: There was one idiot teacher who was all talk,
Jotaro: so I taught him a lesson,
and he hasn't come back to school.
Jotaro: At restaurants that served me lousy food,
Jotaro: I leave without paying the bill all the time.
Jotaro: But...
Jotaro: Even I
Jotaro: know nauseating evil when I see it.
Jotaro: Evil is when you use the 
weak for your own gain,
Jotaro: and crush them under your foot.
Jotaro: Especially a woman!
Jotaro: That is exactly what you've done!
Jotaro: Your Stand isn't visible to the 
victim or the law. Therefore...
Jotaro: I shall judge you!
Kakyoin: Evil?
Kakyoin: There, you are wrong.
Kakyoin: Evil refers to the loser.
Kakyoin: Justice refers to the victor.
Kakyoin: The last man standing!
Kakyoin: The method doesn't matter!
Kakyoin: The loser is the evil one.
Kakyoin: And now, the final blow!
Jotaro: What? The loser is evil?
Kakyoin: Emerald Splash!
Jotaro: Well, in that case...
Kakyoin: What?!
Kakyoin: Impossible! He shrugged off the Emerald Splash?
Jotaro: ...you're the evil one after all!
Jotaro: The one who'll be the judge is...
Jotaro: my Stand!
Kakyoin: What a powerful Stand...
Jotaro: You just caught it by surprise 
and hurt its chest a little.
Jotaro: Lucky for me it's not a weak Stand,
but I have a feeling it'll become more violent.
Jotaro: That was close.
Jotaro: She should be fine once her wounds are treated.
guy: What was that? A gas explosion?
guy: It came from the nurse's office!
guy: None of you leave the classroom!
Jotaro: I'll leave the rest to them.
Jotaro: I'm ditching school today.
Jotaro: I've got to have him explain 
some things about DIO.
Holly: Jotaro's totally thinking 
about me at school right now!
Holly: I felt like I had a connection 
with my son just now.
Jotaro: I'm not thinking about you.
Holly: Jotaro!
Holly: Wh-What about school? And who is that?
Holly: H-He's covered in blood!
Holly: D-Don't tell me... you did that?
Jotaro: It's got nothing to do with you.
Jotaro: I'm looking for the Old Man.
Jotaro: Sucks having to find him in such a huge house.
Holly: I think your grandfather's in the tea room,
Holly: with Mister Avdol.
Holly (internal): Oh, Jotaro...
Holly (internal): You won't tell me anything.
Holly (internal): Even though I... I...
Holly (internal): worry about you so much.
Holly: But I know that, deep down,
Holly: you're a sweet boy.
Jotaro: Hey.
Holly: Yes?
Jotaro: You look a little pale this morning.
Jotaro: Are you all right?
Holly: Yay! Fine, thank you!
Holly (internal): I knew it.
Joseph: Well, this is no good. It's too late for him.
Joseph: He's not going to make it.
Joseph: He'll die in the next few days.
Joseph: Jotaro, it's not your fault.
Joseph: Look. The reason that this 
man swore loyalty to DIO
Joseph: and came to kill you...
Joseph: is right here!
Jotaro: What the hell is that?!
