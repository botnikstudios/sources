Joseph: It's too late for him.
Joseph: He's not going to make it.
Joseph: He'll die in the next few days.
Joseph: Jotaro, it's not your fault.
Joseph: Look. The reason that this 
man swore loyalty to DIO
Joseph: and came to kill you...
Joseph: is right here!
Jotaro: What is that spider-like growth?
Jotaro: You said that's the reason he swore loyalty to DIO?
Avdol: That is a flesh bud, formed from DIO's own cells.
Avdol: It connects to his brain.
Avdol: This tiny little flesh bud was implanted in his brain
Avdol: to influence his mind.
Joseph: In other words, that flesh bud is a controller
Joseph: that draws forth certain feelings.
Joseph: Charisma!
Joseph: The feelings that make
soldiers want to obey dictators!
Joseph: The feelings that make true
believers follow cult leaders!
Joseph: This young man admired
DIO and swore loyalty to him!
Joseph: DIO is a charismatic figure,
Joseph: which means he can sway others
with his overwhelming powers of attraction.
Joseph: He used that to order this young man,
called Kakyoin, to kill us.
Jotaro: So operate on him and remove it.
Joseph: The brain is very delicate.
If he were to move while we were extracting it,
we could inflict brain damage.
Avdol: Jojo.
Avdol: The following happened four months ago,
Avdol: in Cairo, Egypt.
Avdol: I met DIO!
Avdol: I am a fortune teller by trade.
I have a shop in a souk called Khan el-Khalili.
Avdol: It was the night of the full moon.
Avdol: He...
Avdol: stood quietly on the stairs that
led up to my shop's second floor.
Avdol: His cold gaze felt as if it was
trying to stealthily pierce my heart.
Avdol: His golden hair,
Avdol: his near-transparent alabaster skin,
Avdol: and his strange sensuality made
it hard to believe he was a man.
Avdol: I had heard about him from
Mr. Joestar, so I knew immediately
Avdol: that he was DIO, back from the Atlantic's depths!
DIO: I hear that you have powers 
that ordinary people don't.
DIO: I'd be grateful if you could show them to me.
Avdol: It was then that I found him truly terrifying.
Avdol: His words brought such peace to my soul.
Avdol: They had a dangerous sweetness.
Avdol: That's exactly why he was terrifying!
DIO: Come, Avdol...
Avdol: I ran for my life.
Avdol: I didn't dare think of fighting him.
Avdol: I was very lucky.
Avdol: Because I had heard about 
DIO and realized it was him,
I was able to immediately 
jump out the window.
I knew the labyrinthine souk below like the 
back of my hand, so I was able to escape.
Avdol: Otherwise, I would have 
ended up like this young man,
made into one of his
followers through a flesh bud.
Joseph: You would have died a few years later, 
your brain completely devoured.
Jotaro: Died?
Jotaro: Hold on a minute.
Kakyoin here...
Jotaro: isn't dead yet!
Jotaro: I'll pull it out using my Stand!
Joseph: Wait, Jotaro!
Jotaro: Old man, don't touch me!
Jotaro: I'll pull it out without harming his brain.
Jotaro: My Stand moves with such precision 
that it can grasp even a bullet.
Joseph: Stop! That flesh bud is alive!
Joseph: Don't you realize why part of
the flesh bud is outside of his body?
Joseph: That's why not even the
best surgeon could extract it!
Joseph: Shit!
Avdol: The flesh bud stabbed him with a tentacle!
Avdol: This isn't good! Let go, Jojo!
Joseph: It will try to enter the brain of 
anyone who tries to extract it!
Kakyoin: You...
Jotaro: Don't move, Kakyoin.
If I fail, your brain is done for.
Avdol: Let go, Jojo! It's gone up to your face!
Joseph: Wait, Avdol!
Joseph: My grandson is quite the man.
Joseph: It's entered his body, 
and yet he's completely calm.
Joseph: He isn't even trembling. Nor is his Stand!
Joseph: He moves with more precision 
and strength than I anticipated.
Avdol: He did it!
Joseph: Overdrive!
Kakyoin: Wh...
Kakyoin: Why?
Kakyoin: Why did you risk your life to save me?
Jotaro: Who knows?
Jotaro: I'm not really sure myself.
Holly (internal): Mama sees right through you, Jotaro.
Holly: And done.
Kakyoin: Thank you... very much.
Holly: Kakyoin, wasn't it?
Holly: You should rest for a while.
Holly: Stay the night tonight.
Holly: Huh? Um...
Kakyoin: Papa, please get his futon ready.
Joseph: Why do I have to do that?!
Joseph: I've never even liked the
idea of sleeping on the floor!
Joseph: Holly, replace the futon
in my room with a real bed!
Holly: Papa, you're in Japan,
so please just get used to
the Japanese way of doing things.
Holly: Oh, and call me "Seiko."
Joseph: What?!
Holly: Holly comes from the word "Holy," 
which is "Seinaru" in Japanese.
Holly: So all my friends call me "Seiko."
Joseph: What the hell is that?!
"Holly" is the wonderful name I gave you mys—
Holly: If you don't call me "Seiko" 
from now on, I won't answer.
Joseph: Holly!
Holly: Does it hurt, Kakyoin?
Kakyoin: I-I'm fine.
Joseph: Holly!
Jotaro: Good grief...
All right, Kakyoin, take off your uniform.
Kakyoin: Huh?
Holly: Come on, now.
Joseph: Holly!
Holly: Hmph.
Joseph: Holly! Hey, Holly.
Joseph: Hey, where are you?
Joseph: Take a good look. These are Jotaro's pants.
Joseph: Where are mine?
The size is just right, but I can't wear these!
Joseph: Hey, Holly!
Joseph: Oh, I have to call her "Seiko" 
or she won't come out?
Joseph: No, my daughter is Holly.
Holly! Answer me!
Jotaro: I'm definitely going to go to school today.
Jotaro: That's weird...
Holly: Here, a goodbye kiss.
Holly: Smooch.
Jotaro (internal): That's usually how it plays out...
Avdol: Ms...
Avdol: Ms. Holly!
Avdol: Ms. Holly! Ms. Holly!
Avdol: She's got a really high fever...
Avdol: Is she sick?
Avdol: This is... It can't be!
Avdol: P-Pardon...
Avdol: H-How can this be?
Avdol: It's intangible...
Avdol: It's a Stand!
Avdol: A Stand has manifested 
from Ms. Holly, as well!
Avdol: Ms. Holly has a Stand, too.
Avdol: B-But this high fever... 
The Stand is causing her harm.
Avdol: We thought that only Jojo and Mr. Joestar
were being affected by DIO's body,
Avdol: and were relieved that Ms. Holly was unaffected.
Avdol: No, we merely wanted to be relieved.
Avdol: But there's no way she could be unaffected.
Avdol: Anyone who has the blood of
the Joestar family in their veins
Avdol: should be affected by DIO.
Avdol: But...
Avdol: Stands are controlled by a person's mental strength,
and move with their fighting instincts.
Avdol: Ms. Holly is very gentle and peaceful.
Avdol: She therefore lacks the
strength to withstand DIO's curse.
Avdol: She has no power to move her Stand.
Avdol: That's why her Stand is moving
against her and harming her!
Avdol: This isn't good at all. At this rate...
Avdol: She'll die!
Avdol: She'll be killed!
Joseph: A S-Stand...
Joseph: Holly...
Joseph: This... This is the one thing I feared most!
Joseph: M-My daughter finally has a Stand.
Joseph: I knew she didn't have 
the power to withstand it.
Joseph: I knew she didn't have the power 
to deny the curse from DIO's soul.
Jotaro: Tell me how we should deal with this!
Joseph: There's only one way.
Joseph: We need to find DIO!
Joseph: We need to kill DIO and lift the curse!
That's all we can do!
Joseph: But...
Joseph: No matter how many times I try,
he hides in the darkness.
Joseph: In every spirit photo I take, 
the background is darkness!
Joseph: I cannot find out where he 
is with my spirit photos.
Avdol: We've used various means to analyze them, 
but with this darkness, it always failed.
Jotaro: You should've told me that in the first place.
Jotaro: I might be able to find out where
Jotaro: that darkness or whatever is!
Jotaro: Did you see something in the space behind DIO?
Jotaro: My Stand is able to move with
such accuracy that it could
extract a flesh bud from his brain,
and with such precision that it can grasp a bullet.
Jotaro: Let's have him sketch.
Avdol: A fly! A fly was in that space!
Joseph: But a fly won't help us at all—
Avdol: Wait a moment!
Avdol: I've seen this fly before!
Joseph: What?!
Avdol: Jojo, do you have an encyclopedia?
Jotaro: We've got a library.
Avdol: I'll take the memo.
Avdol: And I'll go investigate.
Joseph: Holly!
Holly: Papa, I...
Joseph: Just rest. Jotaro, get some water.
Avdol: You seem to be doing well.
Avdol: Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.
Kakyoin: Is it really possible for your own Stand to kill you?
Avdol: It is. In the past, I have seen 
many people suffer that fate.
Avdol: Right now, it's just her back,
Avdol: but eventually that Stand,
growing like a fern,
Avdol: will slowly bind Ms. Holly's entire body.
Avdol: She will suffer high fevers and various illnesses,
Avdol: fall into a coma from which she'll never awaken,
Avdol: and die.
Avdol: A normal human
would die of something unseen and unknown,
and no skilled doctor would 
be able to treat them.
Avdol: No one, not you nor I, 
can do anything about it.
Avdol: But there is still hope.
Avdol: It will take fifty days for 
her to reach that state.
Avdol: We will find and defeat DIO before that.
Avdol: If we are able to destroy
the connection to DIO's Stand,
we can save her!
Holly: Thank you, Jotaro.
Holly: Really, I wonder what's wrong with me...
Holly: I can't believe I took fever and passed out.
Holly: But...
Holly: I feel better now.
Jotaro (internal): She hasn't realized what happened, 
since it's coming from her back.
Joseph: You gave me quite the scare, Holly.
Joseph: Come now. You've got to
brush your teeth now that you're up.
Joseph: Say, "ahh."
Holly: Ahh...
Joseph: We've got to wash your face...
Joseph: Your hair is a mess, too.
Joseph: Then we'll take care of your nails...
Joseph: Ahh...
Holly: Ahh...
Holly: Papa, help me change my underwear, too.
Holly: I'm kidding! It was a joke!
Holly: Now, then, what do you want 
to eat for dinner, Jotaro?
Joseph: H-Hey...
Jotaro: Don't move! Just stay in bed!
Jotaro: I-I'm saying that you shouldn't do 
anything until your fever goes down.
Jotaro: Just shut up and get better soon.
Joseph: Holly, come on...
Holly: You're right.
Holly: You're all so nice when I'm sick.
Holly: Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.
Joseph: H-Holly!
Joseph: Sh-She lost consciousness again.
Joseph: She's acting cheerful, but she's burning up.
Joseph: The way she acted confirms it.
Joseph: Though she hasn't said anything,
my daughter is aware of her Stand.
Joseph: She was actually trying to hide her Stand from us.
Joseph: She was trying not to worry us!
Joseph: That's what kind of person my daughter is.
Avdol: Mr. Joestar, I've found it!
Avdol: That fly is...
Avdol: This.
narator: The Nile Ue Ue Fly.
narator: It dwells only within the Nile River Basin.
narator: The ones with the stripes 
on their legs are known
as Aswan Ue Ue Flies.
Joseph: Egypt!
Avdol: And we've narrowed it
down to the Aswan area.
Avdol: DIO is there!
Kakyoin: So it is Egypt...
Jotaro: Kakyoin.
Joseph: What do you mean by that?
Kakyoin: The flesh bud was planted in 
my brain three months ago.
Kakyoin: When my family was on vacation in 
Egypt visiting the Nile, I met DIO.
Avdol: You were in Egypt, too?
Avdol: It appears that, for some reason, 
DIO doesn't want to leave Egypt.
Kakyoin: When are you going?
Kakyoin: I'll go with you.
Jotaro: Go with us? Why would you?
Kakyoin: About that...
Kakyoin: I'm not sure why I suddenly 
want to join you, either.
Kakyoin: I've regained my senses because of you.
Kakyoin: That's all.
Joseph: Holly... we'll save you, no matter what.
Joseph: Don't worry.
Joseph: There's nothing to worry about...
We'll make you better.
Joseph: You just take it easy.
Kakyoin: Jojo's mother, Ms. Holly, is a woman 
who can calm the hearts of others.
Kakyoin: People feel at ease when she is nearby.
Kakyoin: This may sound awkward,
but if I were to fall in love, I'd like
it to be with someone like her.
Kakyoin: I'd feel like I have to protect her.
Kakyoin: I'd want to see her happy, kind smile.
Avdol: Indeed.
Joseph: There's no time. We're leaving immediately.
Joseph: They're doctors from the Speedwagon
Foundation. We can trust them.
Joseph: They will take care of Holly around the clock.
Avdol: Jojo, before we leave, since I am a 
fortune teller, I shall name your Stand.
Jotaro: Name?
Avdol: With the cards of fate, the Tarot.
Avdol: Choose a card blindly and it shall be decided.
Avdol: This will suggest your fate,
as well as suggest your Stand's power.
Avdol: The Star! The Star card!
Avdol: Then I shall name your Stand...
Avdol: Star Platinum!
narator: Jotaro Kujo. Stand name: Star Platinum!
narator: Powers: Precise movements 
and splendid strength!
narator: Joseph Joestar. Stand name: Hermit Purple!
narator: Power: Spirit photos!
narator: Mohammed Avdol. Stand name: Magician's Red!
narator: Powers: Fire and heat!
narator: Noriaki Kakyoin.
Stand name: Hierophant Green!
narator: Powers: Long distance 
manipulation and Emerald Splash!
Joseph: All right, we're off.
Joseph: Let's go!
DIO: As I anticipated...
DIO: They have figured out my location.
DIO: Will you come here to Egypt?
DIO: Joseph and Jotaro...
Joseph: He saw us.
Joseph: I definitely felt DIO looking at us just now.
Jotaro: Yeah.
Joseph: Be careful.
Joseph: The next Stand user may 
already be on this plane.
