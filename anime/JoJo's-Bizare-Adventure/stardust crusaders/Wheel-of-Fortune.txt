narator: Jojo's group acquired a car while 
in the sacred city of Varanasi,
and are now heading toward Pakistan.
Kakyoin: Soon we'll reach the Indo-Pakistani border...
Kakyoin: We'll be saying goodbye to India very soon.
Joseph: Indeed. At first I wondered what 
kind of country we'd walked into,
but now I miss the hustle 
and bustle of Calcutta,
and the rushing waters of the Ganges.
Polnareff: I'll be coming back again,
Polnareff: so I can make Avdol a proper grave.
Kakyoin: Mr. Avdol...
Polnareff: The road's getting narrower.
Polnareff: Stop driving so slow! You're in the way!
Polnareff: I'm gonna pass them.
Kakyoin: Polnareff, you're being reckless!
Polnareff: This four-wheel drive is great!
Joseph: Hey, do you think that might've 
flung pebbles at their car?
Polnareff: Who knows? It could have.
Joseph: We don't need any trouble 
or accidents right now.
I'm wanted because of what 
happened in Varanasi, you know.
Joseph: I'd like to get across the border safely.
Kakyoin: What's the matter, Polnareff?
Joseph: I just told you we don't need accidents!
Polnareff: N-No, look! Look who's standing over there!
Jotaro: Good grief...
Anne: Hey! Looks like we meet again.
Anne: Give me a lift?
Anne: I mean, I'm a girl.
Anne: Soon I'll be wearing a bra,
and doing my nails for the boys.
Anne: I'd look pathetic wandering around 
the world when I'm that age.
Anne: This is the only chance I have! Right now!
To run away from home and see the world...
Anne: Don't you think so?
Anne: I mean, I feel bad for lying about 
going to see my dad in Singapore,
Anne: but let's just forget that.
Jotaro: It's the car we passed earlier.
Jotaro: They appear to be in a hurry.
Joseph: Let them pass.
Polnareff: Yeah...
Polnareff: Hey, now!
Polnareff: What are they trying to do?
Polnareff: I let you pass, so hurry up and go.
Kakyoin: Maybe they're mad because
you were so reckless earlier.
Jotaro: Did you see the driver's face?
Polnareff: No... Maybe it's because of 
all the dust on the window,
but I couldn't see them.
Jotaro: So you couldn't, either...
Jotaro: It couldn't be...
Joseph: Be careful, Polnareff.
Polnareff: Now he's telling me to pass!
Polnareff: Looks like he remembered 
how shitty his car is.
Polnareff: You should have just stayed behind 
me in the first place, dumbass.
Polnareff: What?!
Polnareff: A truck? That's impossible!
Kakyoin: It's no use! We're going to crash!
Jotaro: Star Platinum!
Polnareff: Th-That was close!
Polnareff: If it weren't for Star Platinum's power,
we would have been crushed.
Joseph: Where is it?! Where's that car?
Jotaro: Looks like it took off.
Jotaro: Do you think that car's driver might be
one of the Stand users that are after us?
Jotaro: Or do you think it's
just some random asshole?
Polnareff: Of course it's someone who's after us!
We were almost killed!
Kakyoin: But there hasn't been anything 
like a Stand attack yet.
Joseph: Anyway, all we can do is be careful 
as we head for the border.
Joseph: If someone comes after us again,
we'll just take them down,
no matter who they are.
Polnareff: Yeah.
Kakyoin: What should we do about that truck?
Star Platinum punched it, 
so it's pretty messed up.
Jotaro: Just pretend you never saw it. Ignore it.
Anne (internal): So cool... I'm gonna go crazy...
Joseph: A roadside tea house...
Joseph: Let's take a break.
Joseph: If we take our time, we may 
avoid running into that car.
Joseph: What's that?
guy: Sugarcane juice.
guy: Wanna try some?
Joseph: All right, then...
Joseph: What?!
Polnareff: I-It's him!
That car's here!
Joseph: Hey, I need to ask you something.
Joseph: Where's the driver of that car parked over there?
guy: I-I'm not sure. I didn't 
notice when it parked there...
Kakyoin: I doubt that the driver will just 
come out and announce himself.
Polnareff: He's messing with us!
Joseph: This leaves us with only 
one option. Right, Jotaro?
Jotaro: Yeah...
It'll involve some innocent bystanders, but...
Jotaro: We'll just beat them all down!
Kakyoin: H-Hey, Jotaro, stop!
Kakyoin: Mr. Joestar, you too?! This is going too far!
Polnareff: A face like yours looks the most suspicious...
man: C-Come on!
Polnareff: D-Did we just get played?
Joseph: Did anyone see his face?
Kakyoin: N-No. What is he trying to do?
Kakyoin: He seems like a random crazy driver,
but also like someone who's after us.
Polnareff: It's going to piss me off
if we don't chase him
down and take care of this.
Polnareff: Not to mention
we owe him payback for the truck 
that almost hit us earlier!
Polnareff: Damn it! For a piece of shit car,
it goes pretty fast.
Kakyoin: That's strange. According to the map,
Kakyoin: we should be running
parallel with train tracks here.
Polnareff: Who the hell cares?
We're gonna catch him in a second.
Polnareff: That bastard!
I'm gonna nail him on that curve!
Polnareff: Impossible! It's a dead end!
Joseph: He's gone! Where did he go?!
Polnareff: He disappeared after the curve?
Kakyoin: And a car couldn't cross 
that suspension bridge...
all: What?!
Joseph: I-It's him!
He's coming from behind!
Kakyoin: How did he get behind us?
Polnareff: H-He's pushing us with immense horsepower...
Polnareff: What the hell is this? A tank?!
Polnareff: It's no use! Everyone, 
abandon the car and get out!
Kakyoin: Polnareff!
Kakyoin: What kind of driver gets out of 
the car before everyone else?!
Kakyoin: Who's going to hold down the brake pedal?
Polnareff: Huh?
Polnareff: S-S-Sorry!
Kakyoin: Hierophant Green!
Joseph: Stop!
Hierophant isn't strong enough 
to hold this much weight!
Joseph: It'll just tear its body apart!
Kakyoin: I beg your pardon, Mr. Joestar,
but I know myself quite well.
Kakyoin: I am not a fool.
Joseph: It flew up holding the car's wire winch!
Jotaro: Hmph. Not bad, Kakyoin.
Jotaro: By the way, do you like sumo?
Jotaro: Especially deadlocks at the edge of the ring...
Jotaro: It's exciting, isn't it?
Kakyoin: Ow...
Indeed. I quite enjoy sumo.
Kakyoin: But Jotaro, in sumo, it's against 
the rules to punch your opponent.
Joseph: Since I didn't see anything that 
looked like a Stand attack,
I guess it was just some weirdo.
Polnareff: Yeah. Either way, he can't possibly survive.
Polnareff: Well, I guess he got what he deserved.
Anne: But I wonder why...
Anne: That car was suddenly behind us.
Anne: It's so strange.
ZZ: It's not strange at all...
Polnareff: It's the radio!
It's coming from the car radio!
ZZ: It was able to do that
because it's a Stand, Joestar!
Joseph: What?!
Joseph: If it knows my name, it must be one
of the Stand users that are after us!
Kakyoin: Where is it coming from?
Could it be from the car that just fell?
Polnareff: That's impossible! That thing is totaled!
Jotaro: No, there's a possibility 
the whole car is a Stand.
Jotaro: Just like the Stand for Strength was a boat.
ZZ: The Wheel of Fortune...
That is the card my Stand suggests.
Joseph: The Wheel of Fortune?!
Kakyoin: What is that tremor?
Polnareff: This isn't good...
Joseph: Everyone, get in the car!
Jotaro: No, don't!
Jotaro: Everyone get away from the car!
Polnareff: It can't be...
Kakyoin: The ground!
Polnareff: Impossible! It burrowed up through the ground!
Polnareff: I think it's pretty obvious
that car is actually a Stand!
Kakyoin: It appears that the Stand's user is inside.
Polnareff: What the hell?!
Kakyoin: What is that thing?
Joseph: It's like a living creature!
Polnareff: It transformed! It's going to attack!
Jotaro: Hmph.
It wants to see who's stronger.
Joseph: Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight yet!
Joseph: Not until we know
what that Stand's power is!
three: Jotaro!
Jotaro: I-Impossible... I couldn't see it.
Jotaro: What did it shoot at me, and how?
ZZ: You couldn't see it?
ZZ: You'll soon find out...
ZZ: When you're about to die, that is!
Kakyoin: Jotaro!
Joseph: Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!
Polnareff: What the hell is this?!
The wounds aren't deep,
but it's digging in!
Kakyoin: I can't see it at all.
The Stand appeared to be throwing
something at us, but there's nothing
sticking out of our wounds.
Joseph: Are you all right, Jotaro?
Jotaro: Don't worry about me. Anyway...
Jotaro: I don't know what kind of attack it is,
Jotaro: but it's got good control.
ZZ: I'll go after your legs so 
you can't run anymore,
and then run you over!
Joseph: Run between the boulders!
ZZ: Stop running away!
Kakyoin: What?!
ZZ: What the hell are you guys? Cockroaches?!
Joseph: Oh, no! It's forcing its way in!
Kakyoin: We're no match for it.
Polnareff: It's acting like some stupid musclehead
who couldn't figure out a puzzle ring,
so he just pitched a violent fit instead!
Jotaro: Head further back!
Anne: N-No one's carrying me!
Anne: Yeah, I ran away from home.
I'm a good-for-nothing!
I'm all alone and no one loves me!
Anne: I'll just die!
Jotaro: Good grief.
If you have time to say all that,
you can run, you little brat.
Anne: I love you, Jotaro!
ZZ: Climb if you want.
ZZ: There are literally no roads left for you!
ZZ: Not for escape, not for survival, not for Egypt,
not even a road toward your shining future!
ZZ: Because...
ZZ: This
ZZ: Wheel of Fortune is going 
to grind you into hamburger
and splatter you all over these boulders!
Joseph: Oh, no!
Kakyoin: I-It's climbing up...
Polnareff: Is there anything this car can't do?!
Jotaro: Good grief.
Jotaro: Looks like we're going to have to face it.
Jotaro: Everyone, stay back.
Jotaro: Once it climbs up here,
we'll see the car's underside.
Jotaro: That's when we'll find out who's stronger.
Kakyoin: I see. Once the car's underside is in view,
we may be able to attack it.
ZZ: You're quite energetic, Jotaro!
ZZ: But not smart at all!
ZZ: Your bodies reek of something,
and you haven't even noticed!
Kakyoin: Come to think of it, I smell gasoline.
Polnareff: It's our bodies!
Our bodies smell like gasoline!
Kakyoin: It was shooting gasoline at us!
Kakyoin: It was shooting small amounts of
gasoline at high speed, like bullets.
Polnareff: I-Impossible...
So his attacks weren't to wound us,
but to soak our bodies with gasoline?!
ZZ: Looks like you finally caught on,
but it's too late now!
These electric wires will spark!
Jotaro: What?!
Anne: Jotaro!
Joseph: Jotaro!
Kakyoin: Don't go near him, Mr. Joestar!
Kakyoin: There's gasoline on our bodies, as well.
Joseph: Jotaro!
ZZ: I win! Part Three is over!
Jotaro: Oh? And who exactly is going
to replace me, Jotaro Kujo?
Jotaro: You didn't think it'd be you, did you?
ZZ: You burrowed into the 
ground with Star Platinum!
ZZ: So the only thing that 
burned up was your jacket!
Jotaro: Hmph. By the way, weren't you
saying something about roads earlier?
Jotaro: You were wrong.
A road is something that you make yourself.
Jotaro: And so, I, Jotaro Kujo,
will show you how it's done.
Jotaro: I'll show you exactly how roads are built!
ZZ: I-I'm being crushed...
Anne: Jotaro!
Jotaro: That's how it's done.
Jotaro: Where you went flying,
there is now literally a road.
Jotaro: Good, good.
Kakyoin: What an odd character.
His arms were so huge,
and yet everything else is so small.
Kakyoin: Talk about a bluff.
Polnareff: Hey! Don't you run away!
ZZ: Don't kill me! I'm just in this for the money!
Joseph: Oh, God.
Joseph: To think that the Stand was
disguising such a small car, too.
Joseph: It looks like a sheep that's just been shorn.
Joseph: How pathetic.
sign: I am a priest in training. Please do not disturb 
my ascetic exercises by undoing my restraints.
Joseph: Well, then. Let's take 
this car across the border,
since our car was destroyed.
Kakyoin: It's pretty beat-up.
I wonder if it'll last that long.
ZZ: Help! Help!
Jotaro: By the way, you're going back 
to Hong Kong on an airplane.
Anne: Aw, why?!
Polnareff: Shut up! Don't you get 
that you're in the way?
Joseph: We might not make it...
ZZ: Help!
Sob...
Sob, sob...
Sob, sob...
Sob, sob...
Sob, sob, sob, sob...
Enya: All of the seven Stand users 
I sent have been defeated.
Enya: All of them have been crushed!
Enya: I cannot bear to face Lord DIO.
Enya: Curses! That hateful Polnareff! Kakyoin!
Enya: As well as Jotaro and that geezer Joestar!
Enya: I, Enyaba, will now face you personally!
Enya: With my own Stand, the Justice card!
