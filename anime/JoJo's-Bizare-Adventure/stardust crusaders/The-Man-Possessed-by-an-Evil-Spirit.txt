glasses: W-We did it!
We finally pulled up the treasure chest 
that sank one hundred years ago!
guy 2: All right! Careful now!
guy 2: Keep calm! Just bring it this way...
glasses: I know! I know!
both: Up we go.
guy 3: Isn't it a bit long and narrow 
to be a treasure chest?
glasses: Hey! You're lifting it too high!
guy 2: Okay, I'm putting it down.
guy 2: One, two, three!
glasses: All right! H-Hurry up and pry it open.
guy 3: Wait. Th-This is bizarre.
guy 3: This box is locked from the inside.
glasses: Who the hell cares? Bust it open!
guy 3: Just hang on! There's something written on it.
guy 3: D-I-O... DIO.
guy 3: Is it a name?
glasses: What the hell does it matter?!
glasses: The sun's going to set soon.
glasses: Once it gets dark, we won't 
be able to see anything!
guy 3: Yeah, you're right.
guy 2: Okay, I'll go get the blowtorch.
glasses: Let's say hello to our treasure!
narator: One day, an unmanned 
cabin cruiser was spotted.
narator: The boat was in perfect working order, 
and there were no signs of an attack.
narator: Aboard, there were only
three half-full cups of coffee,
narator: and...
narator: On deck, a steel box, which had been
opened with an acetylene torch.
The box was empty,
narator: and strangely, it had two compartments, 
as if designed to shelter something.
narator: It was thought to have contained treasure,
but after a few months, it was forgotten.
cop a: Jotaro Kujo, 17 years old. 
Height: 195 centimeters.
cop a: His father is Japanese, and a jazz musician.
He's currently on tour.
cop a: His mother is an American of British descent.
Holly: Yes, Jotaro is definitely my son.
cop b: Apparently, his friends at school call him "Jojo,"
derived from the "Jo" of Jotaro and the "jo" in Kujo.
cop b: That's pretty dumb!
Holly: S-So...
Holly: How many people did Jotaro kill?!
Holly: No! Don't tell me! I don't want to hear! No!
cop a: Uh, who said he killed anybody?
cop b: He got into a fight.
cop a: Actually, the thugs he faced were 
armed with nunchucks and knives.
cop a: There were four, including a former boxer,
cop a: and between them, fifteen bones were broken.
cop a: They all had their balls crushed, too...
cop a: Ah, pardon my language...
And they were sent to the hospital.
cop b: Ma'am, please make sure he learns his lesson!
Holly: Okay!
cop a: But the problem is what happened after.
cop a: Could you copy this and pass it around?
lady: Yes, sir.
cop a: Your son is quite the oddball.
cop a: Come in. We'll show you the way.
Holly: Thank you.
cop a: Well, anyway, please take him home.
Holly: What? He's being released already?
cop a: Well, we can't keep him forever.
cop a: By the way, ma'am, 
your Japanese is very good.
cop a: How long have you lived in Japan?
Holly: Twenty years.
cop a: Ah, no wonder.
cop a: Good work, gentlemen.
cop a: We've had our hands full lately.
cop a: There's even a waiting list for cells.
cop b: Your son is just up ahead.
Holly: Jotaro!
Holly: Jotaro, throw the ball to Mama!
Holly: Very good!
Holly: Do your best at the sports meet tomorrow.
Jotaro: Yeah!
Holly (internal): Jotaro...
Holly: We should celebrate.
What would you like to eat today?
Jotaro: I just want to eat your cooking, Mom.
Holly (internal): Jotaro... Jotaro...
Holly (internal): Jotaro... Jotaro...
Holly (internal): Jotaro!
Jotaro: Shut the hell up!
You're so damn annoying, you bitch!
Holly: Okay!
Holly: He's actually a very sweet child.
Holly: He's not capable of doing something so appalling.
cop b: Hey! Don't fall asleep, Kujo!
cop b: You're being released. Get out!
cop b: What part of "go home" don't you understand?!
Jotaro: Mom, go home.
Jotaro: I'm not going to leave here for a while.
Jotaro: I've been possessed by an evil spirit.
Jotaro: I don't know what he'll make me do.
Jotaro: Even during the fight,
it took all I had to stop it.
Jotaro: So don't let me out of this cell.
cop a: For crying out loud...
See what I'm talking about, ma'am?
cop a: We're trying to release him, 
but he refuses to leave.
cop a: Forgive my asking, but is 
your son all right upstairs?
cop b: This isn't a hotel!
guy 3: Please! Let us change cells!
guy 2: He's telling the truth!
guy 1: There really is an evil spirit possessing him!
guy 3: It's terrifying!
guy 2: We won't do anything bad again!
cop b: That's enough! Quiet down!
cop b: Wh-What is that?
cop a: You've been locked up! 
How'd you get that in here?!
Jotaro: I told you.
Jotaro: It's the evil spirit.
Jotaro: The evil spirit brings things to me.
radio: Nokotta! Nokotta! Nokotta!
radio: He tosses him out of the ring! 
Chiyonofuji wins all fourteen matches!
cop a: H-He's listening to a boombox 
and reading Shonen Jump!
cop b: H-How?! Th-This is a problem!
This is a huge problem!
Jotaro: Hold it!
Jotaro: This might not be enough to 
stop you from releasing me.
Jotaro: I'll show you what a terror 
my evil spirit can be.
Jotaro: Just so you'll understand how 
dangerous it could be to let me out.
cop b: M-My gun! How?!
cop a: W-We've got trouble!
Jotaro: Well? Did you guys see 
my evil spirit just now?!
Jotaro: If you didn't, then...
Holly: J-Jotaro!
Jotaro: There's someone behind me.
It seems to have possessed me recently.
Holly (internal): His grandpa, Joseph, had strange powers...
Holly (internal): B-But what's happening to my son?
Holly: Papa!
Holly: Over here, Papa! Over here!
Joseph: Holly! Hey, outta my way!
Holly: Papa!
Holly: Papa!
Holly: I'm so glad you came!
Joseph: If my only daughter needs my help,
I can be anywhere in the world within 24 hours!
Holly: Where's Mama?
Joseph: She complained...
But I told Suzie it was a business 
trip for Joestar Real Estate Agency.
Holly: Papa...
Joseph: Holly... Holly.
Joseph: Hey, Holly! Get off of me already!
Holly: No!
Holly: It's been forever since you've held me, Papa!
Joseph: Look, you...
Joseph: You're a 45-year-old woman. 
How can you talk like that?
Holly: Oh, now you've done it! 
I'm going to tickle you!
Holly: Tickle, tickle, tickle...
Joseph: Hey! Stop that!
Holly: Take that and that!
Joseph: What the hell are you guys staring at?
kid: Mama...
mom: Don't look!
Holly: I'll take your bag.
Joseph: By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...
Joseph: You're certain he said "evil spirit"?
Holly: Oh... my dear Jotaro!
Holly: Yes. The policemen said they couldn't see it,
Holly: but I clearly saw it.
Holly: I saw a separate arm...
Holly: And it grabbed the gun!
Joseph: Others couldn't see it, but you could?
Holly: Yes...
Joseph: So Jotaro says that he's 
been possessed recently,
Joseph: but nothing strange has happened to you?
Holly: No. But Jotaro says he won't leave
the cell until he knows what's going on.
Holly: What should I do, Papa?
Joseph: There, there, my beloved daughter.
Joseph: I, Joseph Joestar, am here now,
so there's nothing to worry about.
Holly: Right.
Joseph: First, I'd like to hurry
Joseph: and see my grandson, Jotaro!
cop a: H-How terrifying!
cop a: He's got more stuff again...
cop a: And it's violent.
There's something terrifying possessing him...
cop a: I-If anyone outside found out about this, 
I'd lose my job in a heartbeat.
Joseph: Don't worry.
I'll take my grandson home.
Jotaro: "Grandson"?
cop b: Hey, what are you planning to do?
cop a: I told you, you can't go in any further!
cop a: Convince him from over here! It's dangerous!
Joseph: It's fine. Step aside! Leave him to me.
cop a: We can't be held responsible for this! Y-You...
Joseph: Come now, you're in the way.
Holly: Jotaro! It's your grandfather!
Holly: I'm sure he'll be able to help you!
Holly: Please come out with your grandfather.
Joseph: Get out. We're going home.
Jotaro: Get lost.
Jotaro: I didn't ask you to come here.
Jotaro: Help me? What the hell can you do?
Jotaro: Sorry you came all the way from New York,
Jotaro: but there's no way you can help me.
Joseph (internal): Th-The pinky from my artificial left hand!
Joseph (internal): When was it torn off?
Jotaro: You see? Do you get it now?
That's my evil spirit.
Jotaro: Don't get close to me.
Jotaro: You'll just shorten what 
little life you have left.
Joseph (internal): H-How can this be? I don't believe it...
Joseph (internal): It was able to deceive me right off the bat...
Joseph (internal): Yes... I know exactly
what Jotaro's evil spirit is.
Joseph (internal): But rather than explaining it with words,
Joseph (internal): if he experiences the truth himself,
Joseph (internal): he'll understand it much better.
Joseph (internal): No, he needs to physically understand,
because of the dangers 
he'll face in the future.
Joseph: Avdol, you're up.
Joseph: This is my Egyptian friend 
I met three years ago,
Joseph: Avdol.
Joseph: Chase my grandson Jotaro out of this cell.
Jotaro: Don't.
Jotaro: He looks strong, but do you really 
think I'd let someone
Jotaro: chase me out of here just 
because you told him to do it?
Jotaro: Hell, no.
Jotaro: Now I'm just gonna be even more stubborn
and want to leave even less.
Avdol: I'll have to get a bit violent.
Avdol: But soon enough, 
he'll be so addled with pain,
he'll be squealing, 
"Please get me out of here."
Joseph: That's fine.
Holly: Papa, what are you doing?
cop: H-Hey, we can't have youâ€”
Joseph: Shut up.
cop b: Yes, sir!
Jotaro: That's...
Joseph: That's right.
Avdol also has a so-called "evil spirit."
Joseph: An evil spirit that Avdol can control freely!
Joseph: The evil spirit's name is...
Joseph: Magician's Red!
Jotaro: I-It's hot! Fire! I'm burning!
My arms are burning!
Jotaro: Wh-What is this evil spirit?
cop a: Kujo's plastered himself
against the wall and won't move.
cop b: I don't get this at all.
cop b: B-But isn't it getting sort of...
cop b: How is it that hot?!
cop b: That's insane! It's way too hot!
Joseph: There it is! It's finally shown itself!
Joseph: And the fact that it's so clearly 
visible means it's very powerful.
Jotaro: Why you...
Avdol: I can't believe he's able to 
make it manifest this clearly!
Jotaro: I'm surprised you have an evil spirit, too.
Jotaro: And Grandpa, the identity of the evil spirit...
Jotaro: I know it, yes.
Jotaro: Mr. Joestar,
Avdol: you asked me to get your 
grandson out of the cell.
Avdol: I was planning on holding back,
Avdol: but considering its unexpected power,
one misstep and we'll be in danger.
Avdol: Shall I stop?
Avdol: If you still insist that I get him out, 
I'll have to get violent enough
Avdol: to send your grandson to the hospital.
Joseph: That's fine. Give it a shot.
Avdol: Yes, sir!
Avdol: Red Bind!
Jotaro: This is...
cop: It's so hot!
cop b: I have no idea what's going on!
Holly: Papa! What are you doing to Jotaro?!
Joseph: Holly, be a good girl and keep quiet.
'Kay?
Jotaro: I-I can't breathe...
Holly: The evil spirit's withdrawing.
Joseph: If the heat is restricting your breathing,
Joseph: your evil spirit will weaken.
Joseph: I shall reveal its identity!
Joseph: It may seem like an evil spirit, but it is not.
Joseph: Jotaro! What you believed to be an evil spirit
Joseph: is a powerful vision, 
created from your own life energy.
Joseph: Because it appears next to you,
that vision is called...
Joseph: A Stand!
Jotaro (internal): A Stand?
Avdol: As told in Aesop's fable,
Avdol: the cold wind only made the 
traveler pull his coat on tight,
Avdol: but the heat made him admit defeat.
Avdol: Do you want to come out 
of your cage now, Jojo?
Jotaro: Enough of this.
Jotaro: The reason I won't leave
Jotaro: is because I keep harming 
others without realizing it.
Jotaro: Sure, it interests me that 
you have an evil spirit, too.
Jotaro: But if you keep going,
Jotaro: you're gonna die.
cop b: He broke the toilet!
cop a: Th-That's destruction of property!
Jotaro: I warned you.
Bastard!
Jotaro: Don't say I didn't warn you!
Jotaro: Hey!
Why'd you suddenly turn your back on me?!
Jotaro: Turn and face me!
Avdol: Mr. Joestar.
Avdol: As you can see,
I've gotten him out of his cell.
Avdol: But...
Jotaro: Are you saying you let me win?
Avdol: Not exactly.
Avdol: I truly did plan to send you to the hospital,
Avdol: but I did not expect such power.
Jotaro: If I hadn't stopped this steel rod,
what were you going to do?
Avdol: My Stand is Magician's Red.
Avdol: It could melt a steel rod
like this in the air with ease.
Joseph: Avdol has the same power as you.
Joseph: You don't have to stay in that cell
Joseph: to research your evil spirit any longer.
Holly: Oh, thank goodness.
Holly: Jotaro finally came out of his cell.
Jotaro: You're so annoying, you bitch.
Holly: Okay!
Joseph: Hey!
Joseph: How dare you call your 
own mother a bitch, huh?!
Joseph: And, Holly, stop smiling
after he just called you that!
Holly: Okay!
Jotaro: Grandpa, there's one thing...
Jotaro: I'm going to ask you about
one thing I don't understand.
Jotaro: Why did you know about my evil spiritâ€”
no, my Stand or whatever?
Jotaro: That's what I don't understand.
Joseph: Very well.
Joseph: I came all the way from 
New York to explain that.
Joseph: But in order to explain it,
I must start at the beginning.
Joseph: This has to do with the Joestar family.
Joseph: First, take a look at these pictures.
Jotaro: What are they?
Joseph: That's a hundred-year-old coffin 
pulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,
off the African coast four years ago.
Jotaro: Coffin?
Joseph: After I obtained and researched it,
Joseph: I found out that it was on the 
boat where my grandfather,
the man four generations before you,
Jonathan Joestar, died.
Joseph: It was apparently empty 
when they discovered it.
Joseph: But I know exactly what was inside!
Joseph: Avdol and I are trying to 
locate him as we speak.
Jotaro: Him? Hold on a sec.
Jotaro: You're making it sound like 
there was a person in there.
Jotaro: Why would you call something lost 
at sea for a hundred years "him"?
Joseph: He is evil incarnate!
Joseph: His name is DIO!
Joseph: He has awakened from his hundred-year sleep.
Joseph: We are fated to fight him!
Joseph: What was that, Jotaro?!
Joseph: Don't make a face like this 
has nothing to do with you!
Jotaro: This face means,
"That was so stupid, I don't 
know what to say," Gramps.
Joseph: G-Gramps?
Jotaro: Avdol, was it?
I don't know who you are, 
but you're sure full of yourself.
Jotaro: And Old Man, do you expect 
me to hear such a crazy story
and just say, "Oh, I see," and believe it?
Avdol: But is it not a fact that our 
evil spirits are crazy, as well?
Joseph: Well, whatever.
Soon, you'll have no choice but to believe.
Joseph: If you ask me why I know of DIO's existence,
Joseph: and why I'm after him...
Joseph: I'll show you the reason.
Joseph: Actually, about a year ago,
I also suddenly obtained an evil spirit,
or rather, the power of a Stand.
Holly: What?
Jotaro: Old Man, what did youâ€”
Joseph: I shall show you!
Joseph: This is
Joseph: my Stand!
Joseph: Did you see it?
The thorns that came from my hand?
This is my Stand!
Joseph: Its power is to take spirit photos of 
visions I captured from far-off places!
Joseph: Though I have to smash and destroy a 
30,000 yen camera every time I do it.
waitor: Sir, is something wrong?
Avdol: We're fine. Go away.
waitor: Right...
Joseph: The vision that's going to 
appear in this picture,
Joseph: Jotaro...
Joseph: will be what determines your fate!
Jotaro: What?
Joseph: Jotaro, Holly, have either of you ever 
looked carefully at the back of your necks?
Jotaro: What do you mean?
Joseph: You've probably never taken a close look.
Joseph: But right around the base of my neck, 
there is a star-shaped birthmark.
Jotaro: I'll ask again. What the hell does all this mean?
Joseph: I asked my mother about it,
Joseph: and she said that my father,
who died when I was young, also had it.
Joseph: Apparently, those of the Joestar 
bloodline all have this birthmark.
Jotaro: Hey, Old Man,
Jotaro: I'm asking you what's going 
to show up on that photo.
Joseph: It is our destiny, as yet undiscovered!
Jotaro: Papa...
Holly: Damn it, just show me what's on it already!
Joseph: DIO!
He is always the one who 
shows up in my spirit photos.
Joseph: And on the back of his neck...
Joseph: From this bastard's neck down,
Joseph: is the body of my grandfather, 
Jonathan Joestar,
Joseph: which that bastard has taken over!
Joseph: A hundred years ago,
an incident occurred in the Atlantic Ocean.
Joseph: I only know what I heard 
from my grandmother, Erina,
Joseph: but DIO took over the body of 
my grandfather and survived!
Joseph: And this much is certain:
Joseph: He is currently hiding somewhere 
in the world, plotting something!
Joseph: It's been four years since he came back.
Joseph: The reason my spirit photos and your evil spirits
Joseph: all began manifesting in this past year...
Joseph: is most likely DIO!
avdol: In the wider world, our gifts 
are considered psychic powers.
avdol: I've had my Stand since birth,
avdol: but your powers are bound to DIO's body...
avdol: In other words, Jonathan's body,
by invisible threads.
avdol: All we can say now is that DIO's 
existence is what brought forth
avdol: the powers that were dormant within you.
Joseph: Avdol, from this photo, 
can you tell where he is now?
Avdol: I cannot. There's hardly any background visible.
Joseph: As I thought.
Avdol: I'll take a closer look.
Joseph: Please. Hm?
Joseph: Oh, Holly.
I apologize for bringing all this up so suddenly.
Joseph: Now, let's go home.
Holly: Y-Yes...
Joseph: I will be staying in Japan for a while.
Joseph: And I'll be staying at your place.
Holly: Yes, Papa.
Holly: Let's go, Jotaro.
DIO: It happened again...
DIO: Just now, it felt as though 
someone was watching me again.
DIO: Is it Jonathan's descendants, after all?
DIO: This body must be sending out some 
kind of soul signal to his descendants.
DIO: Very well. This might be called fate...
DIO: A fate I must be rid of,
DIO: a destiny I must erase.
DIO: I have already made my move.
