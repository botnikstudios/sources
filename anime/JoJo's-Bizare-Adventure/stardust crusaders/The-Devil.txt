cop: Hey, you!
cop: You! I'm talking to you!
Polnareff: Huh?
cop: You! You threw this trash, didn't you?
cop: That's a fine of five 
hundred Singapore dollars!
Polnareff: What? Five hundred?
cop: In Singapore, the law says 
you will be fined for littering!
Kakyoin: Five hundred Singapore dollars...
Joseph: That's about 40,000 yen.
Avdol: Trash?
cop: Got it?
Polnareff: Trash?
Polnareff: What are you talking about?
Polnareff: I don't see anything here 
besides my own luggage.
Polnareff: Would you be so kind as to tell me 
what trash you're referring to?
Polnareff: Where is this trash, sir?
cop: That's your luggage?
Polnareff: That's right.
cop: I-I'm terribly sorry.
cop: Well, I'll be going, then...
Polnareff: Shoo, shoo.
Polnareff: What's with the kid? 
She's still following us.
Joseph: Hey, weren't you going to go see your father?
Polnareff: Why don't you stop following us and get going?
Anne: I'm meeting up with him in five days.
I can go wherever I want!
Anne: I'm not taking orders from you guys.
Avdol: She'll be in danger if she stays with us.
Kakyoin: Maybe she doesn't have any money.
Joseph: All right...
Joseph: I guess we can pay for her hotel room.
Joseph: Polnareff, bring her,
but don't hurt her pride.
Polnareff: Got it.
Polnareff: Hey!
Polnareff: You're poor, right?
We'll pay for you, so come with us.
Avdol: Well then, let us check in...
Joseph: R-Right...
front: I'm terribly sorry, but we are 
rather full at this time of year.
front: The rooms won't be next to each other.
Is that all right?
Joseph: Well, I guess we don't have a choice.
Joseph: Then for the rooms...
Joseph: Avdol and I will share a room...
Kakyoin: Jotaro and I will share a room, 
since we're both students.
Avdol: That would mean the last 
room would be Polnareff and...
Anne: You're joking! Like I'd room with him!
Polnareff: What?
Joseph: Well, she is a child, but also a lady...
Joseph: Could you make it four rooms?
Yes.
Polnareff: Hmph! I can relax more in my own room anyway!
Polnareff: Nothing would suit me better!
Polnareff: Let's go.
Polnareff: We've been through hell since we left Hong Kong.
Polnareff: Let's hurry up and take a shower where it's safe.
Polnareff: See ya!
Polnareff: I guess you guys aren't going 
to give us a chance to rest...
Polnareff: Come out.
Polnareff: That's some sharp killing intent you've got there.
Polnareff: Why don't you let me know your name
Polnareff: before I, Polnareff, kill you.
Devo: My name is Devo.
Devo: My Stand suggests the card called The Devil.
Devo: It evokes a curse's dark manipulations, 
deteriorating mental health,
Devo: and an inauspicious path of ruin and downfall.
Devo: How did you know I was in the fridge?
Polnareff: Seriously,
Polnareff: are you that stupid?
Polnareff: You took everything out of the fridge and
didn't bother putting any of it away!
Devo: Ebony Devil!
Polnareff: Silver Chariot!
Polnareff: Talk about pathetic.
Polnareff: The ape we met the other 
day was a much more powerful
and terrifying Stand user than you.
Devo: N-Now you've done it, Polnareff!
Devo: How dare you do this to me?!
Devo: It hurts! It really hurts!
Polnareff: What's with him?
Devo: It hurts!
Devo: Curse you...
Devo: How dare you?! How dare you do that?!
Devo: Now I can really hold a grudge against you!
Devo: Such... Such painful agony must be avenged!
Devo: I let you find me and attack me on purpose!
Polnareff: H-He's gone...
Polnareff: He disappeared?
Polnareff: Wh-What's going on?
Polnareff: I-I can't believe it! When did he cut me?
Polnareff: I-I don't think I felt an attack...
No, I'm sure I didn't feel it.
Polnareff: Mr. Joestar! A Stand user 
was hiding in my room!
Polnareff: Wait, are you Avdol?!
Polnareff: Anyway, listen! He's completely baffling.
Polnareff: I can't tell if he's strong or weak...
Polnareff: H-He was just creepy!
Polnareff: He ran away... damn it, what the hell?
Polnareff: Don't let your guard down! 
My leg's suddenly been cut open.
Avdol: Devo, who suggests The Devil?
Avdol: You're positive that's what he said?
Polnareff: Yeah. But no matter how much I think,
it still doesn't make sense.
Polnareff: I know for a fact that I 
saw a glimpse of his Stand.
Polnareff: But even though I don't remember an attack,
my leg's been gouged.
Polnareff: Anyway!
Polnareff: I'll be there in five minutes.
Polnareff: Room 1212, on the twelfth floor, right?
Polnareff: Contact Kakyoin and Jotaro for me, too! Later!
front: This is the front desk.
Polnareff: Hello? Room service?
Polnareff: I hurt my leg a bit...
Polnareff: Could you bring up some kind 
of medicine and some bandages?
Polnareff: This is Polnareff in room 912.
front: Understood. We'll bring it up immediately.
Polnareff: Aw, man...
Polnareff: I got hurt in the pants that I 
hadn't washed or even worn yet.
Damn it...
Joseph: Do you know about the one
who attacked Polnareff, Avdol?
Avdol: Indeed.
Avdol: Devo The Cursed.
Avdol: An assassin who claims to be 
a Native American medicine man.
Avdol: But he's a terrifying Stand user.
Avdol: Mafioso, militaries, and politicians
from all around the world hire him.
Avdol: I've seen Devo once before.
Avdol: He was covered in wounds,
and those wounds were all obtained
by provoking his enemy to attack.
Avdol: He controls his Stand through the power 
of its grudge against that attacker.
Avdol: That's why, to ordinary people,
it seems like a curse killed the victims.
Joseph: And Polnareff fell for that?
Avdol: Sadly, yes.
Joseph: What kind of Stand does he use?
Avdol: No one knows.
Everyone who meets him ends up killed.
Avdol: Right now, it's dangerous
to leave Polnareff alone.
Or any of us.
Joseph: So he might be able to pick us off, one by one...
Joseph: He'll be here in five minutes.
Everyone meet up in this room.
Jotaro: Got it. We'll all meet up in room 1212, old man.
Kakyoin: What's going on, Jojo?
Jotaro: Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.
Polnareff: That's weird. I can't find my room key.
Polnareff: I could have sworn I set it here...
Polnareff: Damn it! Where is it?
Polnareff: If I don't have my key,
I won't be able to get back in here.
Polnareff: Could I just tell the front desk?
Polnareff: Is there a fine for that?
Polnareff: There it is. Must've fallen
during all the commotion earlier.
Polnareff: Wha...
Polnareff: What?!
Polnareff: Wh-What's...
Polnareff: I-Is this shampoo?! Damn it! My eyes!
Polnareff: Who's there?!
Polnareff (internal): Th-This isn't good!
Being trapped under the bed isn't good!
person: Mr. Polnareff, this is room service.
person: I've brought your medicine.
Polnareff: Get away! You'll be killed!
person: Huh? Wh-What has happened here?!
Polnareff: Get out of here!
I told you, you'll be killed!
Ebony Devil: How dare you?!
Ebony Devil: How dare you stab one of 
my eyes out, Polnareff?!
Polnareff: A doll?! That's the...
Polnareff: Silver Chariot!
Ebony Devil: Are you stupid?!
Ebony Devil: Your Stand isn't one that 
can fight where you can't see!
Anne: Oh, Jojo.
Anne: Did you need something?
Jotaro: So you are here.
Jotaro: Listen up. Don't leave this room for a while.
Anne: Huh?
Jotaro: I'll come for you again later.
Kakyoin: Don't open the door to any stranger, got it?
Anne: O-Okay...
Polnareff (internal): Damn it! How heavy is this bed, anyway?!
Polnareff (internal): It's at least 120 kilograms...
Polnareff (internal): I have to use Silver Chariot to cut this cord...
Polnareff: Y-You bastard!
Polnareff (internal): As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.
Polnareff (internal): Even if I can't see, I'm just 
gonna have to keep stabbing away!
Ebony Devil: You suck!
Ebony Devil: Looks like even a knight 
can't cut open a watermelon
when he can't see!
Ebony Devil: Talk about dense!
Polnareff: You bastard...
Polnareff: Give a rest already...
Polnareff: You little shrimp!
Joseph: It's just you two?
Avdol: What happened to the girl?
Jotaro: Well, we went to check on her...
Kakyoin: But she's not a Stand user, so we thought that
we might be putting her in
more danger by bringing her here.
Joseph: Good point. So that just leaves Polnareff.
Joseph: But man, is he late...
Joseph: It's already been way over five minutes.
Ebony Devil: Let me go!
Polnareff: I've caught you.
I'm going to snap your spear in half.
Polnareff (internal): All right.
Polnareff (internal): Damn it... But a-at least I
finally managed to cut the cord...
Polnareff (internal): I need to return Chariot under the 
bed and get the hell out of here.
Polnareff: Wh-What the hell are you doing?!
Polnareff: Huh?
Ebony Devil: Hey, Polnareff!
I'm gonna bite your balls off now, man!
Polnareff: What an obscene guy.
Polnareff: Chariot!
Ebony Devil: Whoa, there.
Ebony Devil: I'm gonna run off to a 
place you can't see now.
Ebony Devil: You numbskull!
Ebony Devil: Try giving the floor you're 
stuck to a good feel.
Polnareff: Th-This is...
Ebony Devil: It's soaked with beer, juice, and alcohol!
Ebony Devil: I spilled them on purpose!
Ebony Devil: If I could take a piss,
I would have done that to 
make it even more wet.
Ebony Devil: And now... what do you 
think I'm gonna do with this
short-circuiting hair 
dryer and that wet spot,
Ebony Devil: Polnareff?
Ebony Devil: I'm not gonna dry you off!
Ebony Devil: Die!
Ebony Devil: This should take care of my grudge...
Polnareff!
Polnareff: You're not the only one who's 
been scattering stuff around!
Ebony Devil: H-How did you know where
I was on top of the bed...
Ebony Devil: so precisely?!
Polnareff: I broke a mirror!
So I can see the top of the
bed really well from this angle.
Polnareff: At last, we meet.
Polnareff: Whoa, there.
Polnareff: Hey, Devo.
Polnareff: I have a question for you.
Polnareff: I'm looking for a man with two right arms.
Polnareff: How about you tell me 
who that guy's Stand is?
Ebony Devil: You idiot! No assassin
reveals their Stand's identity!
Ebony Devil: The only time they reveal it is
when they or their opponent is dying!
Ebony Devil: With stupid Stand users like you guys 
who keep showing off your Stands,
Ebony Devil: we already know all your weak points!
Ebony Devil: If it weren't for that mirror, 
I would have killed you by now!
Polnareff: All right. Come at me one more time.
Polnareff: What's wrong?
Didn't you say you were going to 
bite off my balls or something?
Polnareff: Just try it, you vulgar little shit!
Polnareff: I'm gonna...
Polnareff: slice up everything except your balls!
person: Excuse me, sir.
It seems that you've been 
in the bathroom a long time.
Are you all right?
avdol: Polnareff, you're finally here.
Joseph: You're not very punctual.
Joseph: All right, everyone.
We're gonna get right to it.
Let's figure out what we're going 
to do if Devo The Cursed attacks us.
Polnareff: I-I'm so tired...
cop: Answer me!
Why was there a dead
boy's body in your room?
cop: And the dead body
that was in the bathroom...
They're connected, aren't they?!
cop: Answer me!
Polnareff: I have the right to remain silent.
Polnareff: You're finally here!
I've been waiting for you.
Joseph: I had the Speedwagon Foundation 
take some measures.
Joseph: Polnareff should be released soon enough.
Avdol: But that was close.
Avdol: To think that the enemy's 
pursuit would come so early...
Joseph: As long as DIO's body is Jonathan Joestar's,
Joseph: he'll know about everything that Jotaro and I do.
Joseph: That's why he keeps coming after 
us without a moment's rest.
Joseph: But on the other hand, we're able 
to read DIO's thoughts, too.
Avdol: I'll go buy a Polaroid camera.
Joseph: You don't have to do that.
I can create a spirit photo 
even without a camera.
Avdol: What?
old: Michael's not here yet? Where's Michael?
tv: This week's number three jumps 
up five points from last week...
news: The price of gold today is...
tv: You look delicious, meow.
What?!
Avdol: The channels seem to be changing chaotically.
Joseph: It's trying to connect words 
from the TV into a sentence.
Joseph: It's more spirit audio than spirit photo.
woman: There...
guy: ...is...
character: ...a...
Joseph: There! It said, "There is a"!
tv: ...trai...
tv: ...tor...
tv: ...among...
tv: ...us...
Joseph: What? What did it just...
Avdol: I'm pretty sure I heard,
"There is a traitor among us..."
tv: Ka...
tv: ...kyo...
tv: ...in...
tv: ...Beware...
tv: ...of...
tv: ...him...
tv: Di...
tv: ...o's...
tv: ...ser...
tv: ...va...
tv: ...nt...
Joseph: Kakyoin?! Wh-What?!
Avdol: I-Impossible. Kakyoin is DIO's servant?
Joseph: This is...
DIO: Joseph Joestar,
DIO: you're watching, aren't you?!
Joseph: DIO!
Avdol: He found us! Look out!
Avdol: B-But what does that mean?
Joseph: It's just as you heard.
It said quite clearly that 
Kakyoin is DIO's servant
and that he will betray us.
Avdol: It can't be!
Joseph: I trust Kakyoin.
Joseph: There must be a reason.
Joseph: But if he is indeed communicating with DIO,
Joseph: he could take our heads while 
we're sleeping at any time.
Joseph: He'd be DIO's Trojan Horse!
Joseph: Where is Kakyoin?
Avdol: He's with Jotaro.
