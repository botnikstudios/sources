Joseph: Hey, the sun's about to set.
Polnareff: Despite how confident
that beggar sounded about finding DIO's 
mansion from the photo within three hours,
Polnareff: it looks like he was wrong.
Polnareff: Eh, Avdol?
Avdol: It's occurred to me that
Avdol: it might be better if he didn't find it.
Avdol: It may be
Avdol: that he did find it,
and that's why he hasn't returned.
Polnareff: Hey...
Avdol: There could be a Stand user that prevents
people from getting close to the mansion.
Avdol: It might have been too 
dangerous to ask that beggar
to find the mansion for us.
Polnareff: Hey, now...
Iggy: M-My leg...
My leg...
Iggy: It got chopped off by that icicle.
Iggy: If I didn't abandon my leg, 
I would have been finished.
Iggy: I-I should hide here for a while.
Iggy: I need to hide here and get him off my tail.
Iggy: I'll have the Speedwagon Foundation 
make me an artificial leg.
Iggy: God damn that birdbrain!
You're not going to get away with this.
Iggy: I will get you back for this. Damn it!
Iggy: That noise...
Iggy: It's the sound of something 
diving into the water.
Iggy: I-It can't be...
narator: It is not impossible for a 
bird to dive underwater.
narator: Birds use lungs to breathe, 
just like humans and dogs.
narator: But they also have air sacs that store air,
located in five to six places 
in their chests and abdomens.
narator: Because of these air sacs,
birds are able to fly at an altitude of
six to seven thousand meters, 
where humans would fall comatose.
narator: Even if they were being strangled,
because of the supply of 
oxygen in their bodies,
birds could survive a few minutes.
narator: This means that a bird can stay
underwater much longer than a dog.
Iggy: S-Something's coming closer through the water.
Iggy: That's impossible!
Iggy: I don't want to believe it,
but the sound heading 
straight this way has to be...
Iggy: It couldn't be!
Iggy: It can't be!
Iggy: That asshole bird!
It actually dove into the
water to come after me!
Iggy: That bastard... Where'd he go?!
Iggy: I-It's coming! It's coming again!
Iggy: His ice. One... two... three.
Iggy: Th-Three shots are coming!
Iggy: I deflected them!
Iggy: I-I did it. Serves you right!
Iggy: Th-The water's stopped dripping in...
Iggy: And the icicle's starting to 
freeze over again from the root.
Iggy: Wh-What the hell?
Iggy: I-I get it.
He's freezing all of the water
Iggy: surrounding this area!
Iggy: The airway's been cut off!
Iggy: B-But he's not trying to suffocate me.
Iggy: He's trying to crush me!
Iggy: It's no use. It's gonna collapse!
Iggy: This power's ridiculous! I can't hold out!
Iggy: There's infinite water around 
me that he can freeze.
Iggy: Damn it!
I thought I was hiding in the water,
but instead, I've been cornered!
Iggy: I-I'm just going to have 
to dig my way out.
Iggy: Man, today is really not my day!
Iggy: My front leg gets ripped off, 
and that damn bird is too strong!
Iggy: I'm at my limit. I'm going to be crushed.
Iggy: I have to hurry up and dig a hole to escape.
Iggy: Huh?
What's that? There's some kind 
of hollow space inside...
Iggy: It's the birdbrain!
Iggy: He's gonna shoot an ice missile!
Iggy: Crap! The Fool is behind me!
Iggy: I don't have time to defend.
Iggy: There's no way out, either!
Iggy: I know! I-I'll just have to do this.
If I don't, he'll kill me!
Iggy: I'll let him crush it
Iggy: on purpose,
Iggy: and let the air pressure
launch me forward!
Iggy: I-I did it. I defeated him.
Iggy: Stupid birdbrain. Serves you right...
Iggy: B-But I'm done for.
Iggy: I've lost a lot of blood,
and I don't have the 
strength to swim to shore...
Iggy: I-I'm gonna drown.
Iggy (internal): And here I thought I'd live
a life free of trouble...
Iggy (internal): Damn it,
I messed up...
boy: I can't believe it!
I was just passing by and you 
happened to drift by on the river.
boy: That bird got you, didn't it? 
Just like he got my dogs...
boy: It's okay.
I don't think that bird's close by.
boy: Don't die! Hang in there!
boy: I'll patch you right up.
narator: The bastard bird, Pet Shop, 
and his Stand, Horus: dead.
Polnareff: Damn that Iggy! Where the hell did he go?
Polnareff: He's gotta stop making trouble for us.
Joseph: I'm worried. We haven't 
seen him for quite a while.
Polnareff: That stupid mutt!
Joseph: What's the matter, Jotaro?
Avdol: Is someone following us after all?
Jotaro: No... I thought I heard a voice calling for us.
Joseph: A voice?
Avdol: I-Iggy?!
Polnareff: Iggy!
Avdol: What in the world happened?
Joseph: Iggy's been badly injured!
Polnareff: Hey... He's missing a front leg...
Joseph: D-Did he get run over by a car?
Avdol: He's not the kind of dog
that gets into car accidents.
Avdol: You were attacked by the 
enemy, weren't you, Iggy?
Joseph: But it looks like someone treated his wounds.
Joseph: And with perfect surgical technique.
Jotaro: It wasn't Iggy's voice.
Jotaro: Someone was calling to us in human language.
Kakyoin: It appears that Iggy had 
a run-in with the enemy.
Kakyoin: I saw a boy holding him as he lay dying.
The one who treated him is a doctor 
from the Speedwagon Foundation.
Kakyoin: Just like the one
Kakyoin: who treated my eyes.
Polnareff: Y-You're...
all: Kakyoin!
Polnareff: It's Kakyoin! Hey!
Avdol: Kakyoin, are your eyes okay now?
Kakyoin: I'm glad you're all safe.
Joseph: It's great to see you!
Joseph: Have your wounds healed?
Kakyoin: Yes. I'm fine now.
It left a few scars, but my
vision has completely returned.
Joseph: That's good to hear.
Kakyoin: Jotaro...
Joseph: Hey, Iggy. Where are you going?
Kakyoin: Iggy, who had no interest 
in humans or Stands,
Kakyoin: is apparently trying to lead us somewhere.
Kakyoin: I'm not sure what happened while 
he was fighting the enemy's Stand,
Kakyoin: but he seems rather angry about 
how much pain he endured.
Joseph: Just where is he trying to lead us?
Polnareff: Hey, Iggy, hold on.
Joseph: Th-That car...
Joseph: It's the luxury car that beggar was riding in.
Joseph: Th-This wreckage is...
Polnareff: What did this? There's a huge hole,
like something gigantic pierced it.
Avdol: It's just as I feared.
Avdol: I knew I shoudn't have asked him...
Joseph: Is this the work of the 
Stand user that Iggy fought?
Avdol: It seems there can be little doubt.
Joseph: Iggy!
Polnareff: Hey, what is this?
I'm in a cold sweat all of a sudden.
Polnareff: This overwhelmingly oppressive feeling...
Polnareff: Where's Iggy
t-trying to take us?
Joseph: I already know. This atmosphere is...
Joseph: This dark sensation...
Avdol: Th-This mansion is...
Jotaro: The one from the picture.
Polnareff: Who would have thought you'd 
be the one to find it, Iggy?
narator: The mansion that stood before Jotaro,
projecting an abnormally sinister energy,
narator: housed the cause of all they've been through, 
their destiny: the embodiment of evil.
narator: They had journeyed long
and far to reach this place.
narator: They traveled through many lands,
encountering DIO's countless 
Stand-using assassins.
narator: It was, indeed, a series of life-or-death battles 
that were no simple task to survive.
narator: Tears, laughter, sadness, rage, and happiness.
They experienced many
emotions on this journey.
narator: In order to save Jotaro's mother, Holly,
narator: it has indeed been nearly fifty 
days since they left Japan.
narator: All to defeat DIO, and end 
this hundred-year-old destiny.
narator: Joseph thought to himself.
narator: He was determined to reach his goal
and save his daughter Holly, no matter what!
narator: Kakyoin thought to himself.
narator: In order to save Holly, and to conquer 
the weakness in his own heart,
they would defeat DIO, no matter what.
narator: Avdol thought to himself.
narator: There was evil this world that must not
be allowed to prosper,
and so, must be destroyed.
narator: Polnareff thought to himself.
narator: He would make DIO pay
for manipulating him with 
a flesh bud to make him
act against his own righteousness.
narator: Iggy thought to himself.
narator: The reason he had to endure
all this absurdity was
because of that bastard DIO.
narator: So he was going to pay him 
back for it, no matter what.
narator: And...
Jotaro: In other words, if we beat the shit out of DIO
right here and now, it will all be over.
Joseph: He's here. There's no doubt 
about it, this presence is his.
Joseph: He's inside this mansion right now.
Avdol: Which means that we...
Polnareff: ...have finally reached the 
last stop on our journey.
Polnareff: Are you ready?
Iggy (internal): The gate's open.
We can just walk in.
Iggy (internal): But it was closed yesterday...
Joseph: Just as I can sense his presence, 
he is aware that I have arrived.
Joseph: Entering this mansion carelessly
would be like being swallowed by the enemy.
Joseph: Now...
What to do...
Joseph: The door opened! Watch out!
Polnareff: Hey, look at this corridor. 
I don't see any end to it.
Polnareff: It's not real, is it?
It's some kind of trick or illusion, right?
Joseph: Polnareff, don't go through that door.
Joseph: We should see at least one 
or two Stand users before DIO.
Polnareff: What the?! Something's coming!
Polnareff: Who the hell's that? Is he a Stand user?
Terrence Darby: Welcome.
Master Joestar, we have 
been awaiting your arrival.
Terrence Darby: I am the butler of this mansion.
