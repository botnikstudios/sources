Enya: There is an emotion called fear.
Enya: It's a very natural emotional
reaction found in all animals.
Enya: Why does fear occur?
Enya: There is the fear caused by animal instincts,
Enya: and the fear born of logical thought.
Enya: Namely, when you encounter 
something stronger than yourself
Enya: and realize that you have no way of facing it,
Enya: or when you encounter something unknown.
Enya: Something as simple as
"not knowing" can evoke fear.
Enya: When faced with fear,
you have a number of choices.
Enya: You might struggle, resist, flee,
accept, or many other things.
Enya: But upon meeting Lord DIO,
a new reaction arises...
Enya: Joy!
DIO: How do people act once they feel joy in fear?
Enya: He is currently on the plane
that Joestar and the others are on.
Enya: They will not reach their destination safely.
Enya: A... a rhinoceros beetle?
Jotaro: No...
A stag beetle!
Joseph: Avdol, is that a Stand?
Joseph: Are we already encountering 
another Stand user?
Avdol: It is very possible.
Avdol: It could be a bug-shaped Stand.
Joseph: It hid in the shadow of the seats...
Avdol: Wh-Where did it go?
Kakyoin: Jojo! It's on the side of your head!
Kakyoin: I-It's huge! It has to be a Stand.
Kakyoin: That bug is a Stand!
Jotaro: It's disgusting...
But leave this to me.
avdol: B-Be careful.
Avdol: I've heard there is a user of a bug Stand 
that likes to rip out the tongues of its victims.
Jotaro: Star Platinum!
Avdol: I-It dodged!
Avdol: I-I can't believe it!
Avdol: It's faster than Star Platinum, 
whose speed and precision
are such that it can grasp bullets.
Kakyoin: It has to be a Stand.
That bug is a Stand!
Kakyoin: Where is he? Where is he hiding?!
Kakyoin: Where is the one who's controlling it?!
Kakyoin: I-It's attacking!
Jotaro: No!
Joseph: Jotaro!
Avdol: Jojo!
Joseph: Luckily, it could stop the spirit beetle's 
mouth needle with its teeth, but...
Avdol: Since it tried to bite off Jotaro's Stand's tongue...
Avdol: It must be him!
Avdol: The Tower card of the Tarot...
Avdol: The one that depicts a Stand suggesting
destruction, calamity,
and the end of a journey:
Avdol: Tower of Gray.
Avdol: Tower of Gray commits mass murders,
making them look like accidents.
Avdol: The airplane crash that happened last year
in England, causing 300 deaths,
is thought to have been its work.
Avdol: I had heard rumors,
but it seems he's working with DIO!
Avdol: I-It dodged it.
Not just the single hand,
but it also dodged a two-fisted rush of blows.
Avdol: I-It's so fast...
Tower of Gray: Even if you were to have ten guns
shoot bullets from one centimeter away,
Tower of Gray: they would not be able to touch my Stand!
Tower of Gray: And you couldn't kill my 
Stand with a bullet anyway.
Joseph (internal): He has to be nearby!
Who is it?
Where's the one controlling the Stand?
Joseph (internal): Which one of the passengers is he?
Joseph (internal): If we can track him down...
Jotaro (internal): It disappeared again.
Kakyoin: It moved over there!
Jotaro (internal): What's it planning to do?
Avdol (internal): I-It can't be!
Tower of Gray: Bingo!
Tower of Gray: Got their tongues!
Tower of Gray: And my objective...
narator: Massacre!
narator: This word's meaning: to kill everyone!
Kakyoin: I-It actually did it...
Avdol: I will burn it to death!
Avdol: Magician's Red!
Kakyoin: Wait! Wait a moment, Avdol!
Gray Fly: It's so noisy...
I wonder what all the ruckus is...
Kakyoin: Look out!
Gray Fly: I guess I'll go to the bathroom.
Gray Fly: What's this slimy stuff?
Gray Fly: M... A...
Gray Fly: I-Is it blood?! Blood!
Kakyoin: Atemi.
Kakyoin: We have to defeat it before
the other passengers panic.
Kakyoin: But, Avdol,
Kakyoin: an active Stand like your Magician's Red
could make the plane explode.
Kakyoin: And Jojo, if your power were to put a 
hole in the fuselage, it'd be a catastrophe.
Kakyoin: My quiet Stand,
Hierophant Green,
is most suited to defeating it.
Tower of Gray: Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?
I've heard all about you from Lord DIO.
Tower of Gray: Stop.
If you know that your Stand is quiet, 
there's no point in challenging me.
Tower of Gray: You cannot catch me with your speed.
Kakyoin: You think so?
Kakyoin: Emerald Splash!
Kakyoin: Emerald Splash!
Tower of Gray: You seem to think you can 
hit me if you fire enough shots,
Tower of Gray: but you haven't hit me at all!
Avdol: This isn't good. It's still dodging with its speed!
Jotaro: K-Kakyoin!
Tower of Gray: My speed is on an entirely different level.
Tower of Gray: You're way too slow to get a bingo.
Tower of Gray: And Kakyoin...
Tower of Gray: With my next attack,
I'll stab your Stand's tongue with
this Tower Needle, and rip it out!
Kakyoin: Emerald Splash!
Tower of Gray: Don't you get it?
Avdol: Th-This isn't good!
It dodged Emerald Splash again!
Tower of Gray: Once this rips your tongue out, you'll go mad...
Tower of Gray: From the pain!
Kakyoin: What? If its tongue is ripped out,
it'll go mad from the pain?
Kakyoin: My Hierophant Green?
Tower of Gray: What?!
Kakyoin: If it rips you apart, it'll go mad, all right...
Kakyoin: From joy!
Kakyoin: Hierophant's appendages had
already slipped beneath the sheet.
Kakyoin: Didn't you realize I was trapping
you there with Emerald Splash?
Kakyoin: So that geezer was the user?
Kakyoin: A repulsive Stand usually has a repulsive user.
Kakyoin: It doesn't appear that he has 
DIO's flesh bud in his forehead...
Avdol: From the start, Tower of Gray was 
an evil Stand that killed tourists,
making it look like an
accident only in return for pay.
Avdol: I'm sure DIO was able to 
use him because he was
easily bought, and blinded by greed.
Joseph: Something's wrong.
Joseph: I could be imagining it, but it seems
like the plane is flying crooked.
Joseph: It is crooked.
I-It can't be!
Cabin Attendant: Sir, where are you going?
Cabin Attendant: The cockpit is up ahead,
so passengers may not enter.
Joseph: I know that.
Cabin Attendant: S-Sir!
Cabin Attendant (internal): My! What a handsome man.
Jotaro: Move, bitch.
Cabin Attendant: What a shock!
Kakyoin: Whoa, there.
Kakyoin: Pardon.
Kakyoin: It is inexcusable of him to treat 
women in such a cruel manner...
But this is an emergency.
Kakyoin: Please forgive him.
both: Okay...
Joseph: This is awful!
Joseph: We've been had!
Jotaro: Their tongues have been ripped out.
Jotaro: That stag beetle bastard!
Jotaro: He had already killed the pilots?
Joseph: It's falling.
Joseph: The autopilot's been destroyed, as well.
Joseph: This plane's going to crash!
Jotaro: What?
Gray Fly: I am the Stand that holds The Tower card
which suggests accidents 
and the end of a journey.
Gray Fly: You will not reach Lord DIO!
Gray Fly: Even if you survive this crash,
you are 10,000 kilometers from Egypt!
Gray Fly: Those who swore loyalty to Lord DIO
will pursue you every hour of every day!
Gray Fly: There are Stands in this world 
that you can't even imagine.
Gray Fly: Lord DIO is the master of Stands!
Gray Fly: Lord DIO has the power to 
reign over all of them.
Gray Fly: There's no way you'll reach him!
Gray Fly: You bastards will never reach Egypt!
Jotaro: You're definitely professionals.
Jotaro: It's a good thing you didn't scream. 
That would've been annoying.
Jotaro: Now, I've got a request.
Jotaro: This old man is now going to
emergency land this plane on the water.
Jotaro: Go put life jackets and seat belts 
on all of the other passengers.
Cabin Attendant: G-Got it!
Jotaro: Old man.
Joseph: Well... I have experience 
with propeller planes, but...
Kakyoin: Propellers?
Joseph: But, Jotaro... this is my third time.
Joseph: Have you ever heard of someone being in a
crashing plane three times?
Jotaro: I'm never...
Jotaro: I'm never riding in a plane with you again.
narator: The plane landed 35 kilometers 
off the Hong Kong coast.
narator: Jotaro and the others had no 
choice but to head to Hong Kong.
news: Today, a jumbo jet made an emergency landing
35 kilometers south of Hong Kong,
near Lamma Island.
news: Efforts are underway
to rescue all passengers.
narator: Hong Kong!
narator: Hong Kong Island! Kowloon! The New Territories!
narator: With more than 235 islands in the area,
narator: the view of the area at night is
known as the "Million Dollar View."
Joseph: Right. That's fine.
Joseph: Please make sure the only
ones aboard are us and the crew.
Joseph: Right. We don't want any more victims.
Joseph: Also...
guy: Hey, big guy!
guy: Are you guys tourists?
guy: Want some rice porridge?
guy: If you're in Hong Kong,
you gotta try dim sum or rice porridge.
guy: We have hot cola, too.
Kakyoin: Rice porridge, eh? Not bad.
Kakyoin: Did you know, Jojo?
Kakyoin: Unlike in Japan, rice porridge
is a staple food in Hong Kong.
Kakyoin: I'll have it the popular way,
with pork and a century egg.
guy: Coming right up!
Avdol: Then I'll haveâ€”
Joseph: Hey!
Joseph: What are you guys trying to eat?
Joseph: We're going to go to my friend's shop.
guy: Hey, dandy guy. Want to try 
some Hong Kong hot cola?
Joseph: Hot?!
Joseph: Everybody knows that
cola's supposed to be cold.
Jotaro: Old man, who were you calling?
Joseph: Hm? Oh, I'll explain everything
when we get to the shop.
Joseph: We need to work out a plan that'll get us 
to Egypt as safely and quickly as possible.
Kakyoin: A plan?
Avdol: Mr. Joestar, we cannot allow any 
more innocent civilians to be hurt.
Avdol: The quickest way would be by plane, but...
Joseph: Indeed.
It's now become impossible
for us to fly to Egypt.
Joseph: If we encounter another Stand user
like the last one on a commercial flight,
Joseph: we're sure to cause a disaster
that will harm many people.
Joseph: We'll have to get to Egypt by either land or sea.
Avdol: But if we fail to meet DIO within fifty days...
Kakyoin: If we had stayed on that plane,
we'd probably be in Cairo by now.
Joseph: I'm aware of that.
Joseph: But it's to soon to worry about it.
Joseph: A hundred years ago,
Jules Verne wrote a story in which
the protagonist traveled around the world
in 80 days, traveling 40,000 kilometers.
Joseph: That was in the age of trains and steamboats.
Joseph: Even without a plane, in fifty days,
we'll be able to travel
the 10,000 kilometers to Egypt.
Joseph: As for the route...
Joseph: I say we go by sea.
Joseph: We'll charter a suitably-sized boat,
go around the Malay peninsula, 
and cross the Indian Ocean.
Joseph: It'll be the Silk Road of the sea.
Avdol: I believe that is best, as well.
Avdol: If we go by land, borders will be a hassle.
Avdol: And we'd have to cross
the Himalayas and a desert.
Avdol: If we ran into trouble,
we'd lose a great deal of time.
Avdol: There are too many dangers.
Kakyoin: I haven't been to any of
those places using either route,
Kakyoin: so I can't say anything.
Kakyoin: I'll leave it up to you two.
Jotaro: Same.
Joseph: Then it's decided.
Joseph: The greatest danger will be
the Stand users that DIO sends against us.
Joseph: We'll have to do our best to get 
to Egypt without being spotted.
Kakyoin: This is a sign to let them 
know we want more tea.
Kakyoin: If you do this in Hong Kong, 
they'll bring you seconds.
Kakyoin: Also, when they pour tea into your cup...
Kakyoin: This means "thank you."
Polnareff: Excuse me, do you have a moment?
Polnareff: I'm a tourist from France,
Polnareff: and I'm having a hard time 
with the kanji on the menu.
Polnareff: Would you please help me out?
Jotaro: You're annoying. Go away.
Joseph: Come now, Jotaro. It's fine.
Joseph: I've been to Hong Kong many times,
so I can at least read the kanji on the menu.
Joseph: Why don't you join us?
Joseph: So, what did you want to order?
Joseph: Food with shrimp, duck, 
sharkfin, and mushrooms?
Joseph: We'll have this, this, this...
Joseph: And this, too.
Joseph: Oh, and this.
Avdol: This looks like food with beef, 
fish, clams, and frog, but...
Kakyoin: Indeed. This is rather different.
Jotaro: I knew this would happen.
Joseph: Well, it doesn't matter.
Joseph: It's on me!
Joseph: It doesn't matter what you order.
It's all delicious!
Joseph: All right, everyone, dig in.
Kakyoin: Wow, this is...
Joseph: Well? It's pretty good, isn't it?
Polnareff: Well, they've certainly taken 
a lot of time to prepare this.
Polnareff: Look, these carrots...
Polnareff: They're shaped like stars.
Polnareff: It reminds me of something...
Polnareff: That's right.
Polnareff: Someone I know has this 
exact mark on their neck...
Kakyoin: You...
Kakyoin: Are you another...
Avdol: Mr. Joestar, look out!
Joseph: It's a Stand!
Avdol: Magician's Red!
Avdol: What?!
Avdol: Another Stand user!
Kakyoin: H-His sword is so fast...
Polnareff: My Stand holds The Chariot card!
Polnareff: Silver Chariot!
Polnareff: Mohammed Avdol,
it appears that you want to die first.
Polnareff: I've made a fire clock on that table!
Polnareff: I will kill you by the time 
that clock burns to twelve!
