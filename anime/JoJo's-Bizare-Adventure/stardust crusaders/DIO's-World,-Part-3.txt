The World: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
DIO: So my The World's power and 
precision are both superior!
DIO: I've seen enough. I'm satisfied.
DIO: I will end you now!
DIO: I have decided that
I will show no mercy when
fighting one of the Joestar bloodline,
but will kill them instantly!
DIO: The way to end you is with 
The World's true power!
DIO: The World! Stop time!
DIO: The World!
DIO: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
DIO: With this, the Joestar bloodline will finally end.
DIO: My archenemies, who dared to 
make an appearance in my destiny...
DIO: Farewell!
DIO: Whaâ€”
DIO: What?
DIO: He just moved!
DIO: He... Impossible!
DIO: His finger just moved!
DIO: I-It can't be.
DIO: It can't be!
DIO: They're... the same?
Jotaro: So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.
DIO (internal): The World and Star Platinum 
are the same type of Stand?!
DIO: Can he see me?
Or is he moving his hand subconsciously?
DIO: Time's up.
DIO: Could you see me?
DIO: I asked if you could see me, Jotaro!
Jotaro: Who knows?
I don't know what you're talking about, DIO.
DIO: Very well! It doesn't matter!
DIO: It doesn't matter if you can see me
during stopped time or not!
DIO: If you can move the same way as my The World,
DIO: let me see you moving!
DIO (internal): Yes, it was six months ago 
when I first stopped time.
DIO (internal): In order to test out my 
Stand's power and speed,
DIO (internal): I had one of my servants
fire a shotgun at me.
As I went to catch the pellets...
DIO (internal): For a moment,
it looked like everything had stopped.
That's when it all began.
DIO (internal): At first, I thought it was an illusion.
DIO (internal): Trained boxers and those who are in accidents
feel each moment as if it were 
several seconds or minutes...
DIO (internal): I thought it was something like that.
DIO (internal): But The World was able to step
around the pellets that hung 
suspended in stopped time.
DIO (internal): And...
DIO (internal): It could grab the pellets!
DIO (internal): It's not an illusion!
Enya: Lord DIO!
Enya: You will surely be able to control time!
Enya: You must believe with more conviction 
that you can move within stopped time!
Enya: It must be like breathing.
Enya: Like being able to snap an HB 
pencil in half with your fingers!
Enya: You must believe it's a perfectly 
natural thing for you to do.
Enya: What's most important is 
to recognize it as such.
Enya: You must believe that
it's natural for you to do it!
Enya: You are the emperor of this world!
It's only natural for you to control time!
DIO: And then one day, I felt the wheels of time
DIO: truly enmesh themselves with The World.
DIO: It was like a beam of light
piercing the darkness.
DIO: It truly was a magnificent feeling.
DIO: I, DIO, had truly surpassed 
all forms of life and all Stands!
DIO: And now, I can stop time for five seconds, 
and longer and longer intervals each time!
DIO: Jotaro! I shall see just 
how powerful you truly are!
DIO: The World! Stop time!
DIO: You had placed that magnet on me.
DIO: When we were testing each 
other's strength earlier?
DIO: It looks like a magnet taken 
from a wallet or pocket planner.
DIO: You completely fooled me.
I can't take my eyes off you for a second.
DIO: But!
DIO: If you're using a trick like this,
that proves you can't move during stopped time!
DIO: You only added a few more seconds to your life!
DIO: This time, you will...
The World: Die, Jotaro!
DIO: What?!
DIO: H-He... really can move!
DIO: Only for a moment, but he can move!
DIO: The magnet wasn't to trick me
into thinking he could move...
DIO: But to trick me into thinking he couldn't,
and lure me closer!
Enya: You must believe it's only natural 
that you can stop time!
DIO: Of all things, this descendant of the Joestars
DIO: has invaded my world of stopped time...
Jotaro: I could move for a moment... Just a moment.
Jotaro: But...
Jotaro: Good grief.
It was only enough to get one punch in.
DIO: You. Woman.
DIO: Fetch my leg from over there.
DIO: Hurry up and fetch it!
DIO: Behave like a flight attendant,
bringing a drink
and caviar to a first-class passenger!
Jotaro: I guess I have to bash your head to pieces,
or it'll be like nothing ever happened.
Jotaro: You've already recovered your energy.
Jotaro: Because that hole I put in 
your gut is closed up now.
DIO: Your eyes followed me in 
the world of stopped time...
DIO: So you truly can see my movements, Jotaro.
Jotaro: Seems so.
DIO: Kakyoin did quite well for you.
DIO: Because he figured out the 
secret of The World's powers,
DIO: you were able to figure out that you 
could move during stopped time,
DIO: and so, you were able to invade my world.
DIO: Which makes me think...
DIO: Just how long can you move
within my world of stopped time?
DIO: Two seconds? Three?
Or perhaps you can move five seconds,
just like me, and you're just
pretending that you can't? And so on.
DIO: Well? How about it?
Jotaro (internal): This isn't good.
Jotaro (internal): I could move longer with some practice,
Jotaro (internal): but right now, a moment is the best I can do.
DIO: I believe that you can only 
move for a moment now.
DIO: But since you have invaded 
my world of stopped time,
DIO: it would not be wise to
underestimate you by getting close.
DIO: Even when I still have an 
overwhelming advantage.
DIO: Therefore, Jotaro, I've decided how to kill you
DIO: such that it doesn't matter
how long you can move!
DIO: You've gone pale.
DIO: When you saw these knives,
you realized that you face a more
horrific fate than that geezer Joseph.
Jotaro (internal): Bastard!
How the hell does he come 
up with stuff like this?
Jotaro (internal): He's dangerous.
DIO: You cannot escape!
DIO: The World!
DIO: Five more seconds!
DIO: Once time begins to move again,
DIO: I wonder if even your Star Platinum
can manage to deflect so many knives.
DIO: Four more seconds!
DIO: Being able to see this must be 
all the more terrifying, Jotaro!
DIO: Three more seconds...
DIO: Just two more seconds... 
Is that all you can do?
DIO: This proves that you really can 
move only for a moment.
DIO: One more second...
DIO: Zero.
DIO: It's over.
I'll add one more, just to be sure.
DIO: To be frank, I'm relieved that
I could defeat you so quickly, Jotaro.
DIO: I never thought you would be 
able to enter my stopped time.
DIO: As I see it, those machines known as
automobiles are useful devices,
DIO: but because everyone has one,
the streets become too crowded.
DIO: Only I, DIO, should have
power over stopped time.
Jotaro: Good grief.
Jotaro: Throwing all those knives...
Jotaro: Now my valuable uniform is full of holes.
Jotaro (internal): I stuffed my clothes with magazines
just in case he tried throwing anything...
Jotaro (internal): But I didn't think he'd throw 
that many knives at me.
Jotaro (internal): Playing dead and waiting
for a chance to strike is the
best chance I have right now.
Jotaro (internal): I need to figure out how 
to knock off his head...
Otherwise, he won't die.
DIO: I'd better play it safe.
DIO: The Joestar bloodline has 
proven itself rather lucky.
DIO: He might be trying to
trick me by playing dead.
DIO: I must end him beyond 
a shadow of a doubt!
DIO: By...
DIO: chopping his head off with this!
DIO: This is truly the end for you,
DIO: Jotaro!
Polnareff: Die, DIO!
Polnareff: Die!
Jotaro (internal): Polnareff!
DIO: The World! Time has stopped...
DIO: So it's you, Polnareff?
DIO: And time will move once more.
DIO: Too bad, Polnareff.
DIO: With just a moment more,
DIO: and with just a tiny bit more force,
DIO: you could have torn my brain 
apart with your rapier.
Polnareff: B-Bastard! This is impossible...
DIO: You cannot assassinate DIO.
DIO: Joestar's Egyptian tour group
will be no more, once I finish you.
Jotaro (internal): Damn it. Polnareff's going to get killed.
Jotaro (internal): I wanted to play dead as long as possible,
until I could land a blow to his head, but...
Jotaro (internal): It would be easy for me to keep
Polnareff's head on his shoulders.
Jotaro (internal): But DIO won't enter
Star Platinum's attack range.
Jotaro (internal): It'll end up like it did last time.
Jotaro (internal): I have to make sure he 
doesn't realize I'm alive.
Jotaro (internal): As long as he doesn't know for sure,
my chance to get close to him will come.
Jotaro (internal): Talk about irony.
Jotaro (internal): I tried my hardest to move 
inside his stopped time,
Jotaro (internal): but now I have to try my hardest 
to stay completely still.
DIO: Farewell, Polnareff!
DIO: Jotaro, you...
DIO: You're alive... or you're coming around.
police: Dont move! We're the police!
police: We have guns pointed at you!
police: Put your hands up slowly.
DIO: All right. Perfect timing.
DIO: There's something I'd like 
you to shoot with that gun.
DIO: Shoot the man lying on the ground over there.
DIO: You can shoot his leg, his torso...
Whatever you like.
DIO: Come on. Be sure not to miss.
DIO: Perhaps I was just imagining
that sound I thought
I heard coming from Jotaro.
Jotaro (internal): What a sick thing to do...
Jotaro (internal): But now DIO's attention
is on me, not Polnareff.
Jotaro (internal): Right now, he's suspicious as all hell.
Jotaro (internal): He'll try to make absolutely 
sure that I'm dead.
This is when things get really dangerous.
DIO: The sound of his breathing...
DIO: I don't hear it. He's not breathing.
DIO: Then what about his heartbeat?
Jotaro (internal): This is damn tough...
If I black out, I really will die.
Jotaro (internal): It won't even be funny...
Jotaro (internal): If I die because I used my 
Stand to stop my own heart...
DIO: His heart isn't beating. He is definitely dead.
DIO: I thought he was still alive,
but it was just my imagination.
DIO: Just in case, I'll lop off his head 
so that I can truly rest at ease.
DIO: All right, Jotaro?
DIO: What?!
DIO: Stop time!
The World!
Jotaro: I went through hell there...
Jotaro: But even if you stop time,
Jotaro: I'm still going to blow your head off, DIO.
DIO: Wh-What? It can't be...
Jotaro: Finally...
Jotaro: Finally, I was able to bash his head in.
Jotaro: But that bastard DIO is a monster
who survived a hundred years 
at the bottom of the ocean.
Jotaro: I can't believe he's dead yet.
Jotaro: It's too soon to relax.
DIO: I'll kill you...
DIO: Wh-What is this? Impossible! M-My legs...
DIO: I can't move my legs.
DIO: I can't stand!
DIO: I have a headache... a-and nausea...
DIO: How could this happen? Me, DIO, feeling sick?
DIO: My head's been destroyed, so I can't get up?!
DIO: Damn it! I have to do something!
Jotaro: I covered you with gasoline 
so I can track your smell.
Jotaro: I feel bad, kicking a guy
when he's down, but...
Jotaro: Nah. I don't feel bad about this at all.
Jotaro: My friends and a lot of innocent bystanders
are dead because of you.
DIO: The World!
DIO: If I can...
DIO: If I can get to that place...
DIO: Time... Time will move once more.
Jotaro: He put his ear to the ground
to listen for cars coming near.
But...
Jotaro: I can't let him get away!
DIO: That place... That place!
DIO: If I can just get there...
Jotaro: This place is taken. You can't escape.
Jotaro: Give up, DIO.
DIO: The World! Stoâ€”
DIO: You fell for it, Jotaro!
DIO: This is my escape route!
DIO: You have lost in the battle 
of wits against me, DIO!
DIO: Doesn't this street look familiar?
Jotaro: This street... I-It can't be...
DIO: That's right.
It was my escape route to take 
the blood of Joseph Joestar!
Jotaro: DIO, you bastard!
