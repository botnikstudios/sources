DIO: As I thought...
DIO: Joseph's blood suits me well.
DIO: It suits this body so perfectly,
DIO: my strength is recovering 
faster than ever before!
DIO: It suits me...
DIO: It truly suits me!
DIO: This body belonged to Jonathan 
Joestar one hundred years ago.
DIO: The blood that I just drank was 
from his grandson, Joseph!
DIO: And the one who allowed me to make it this far
DIO: was you, Jotaro.
DIO: The Joestar bloodline was mere dog shit
on the road that is my destiny,
just something lying in my way...
DIO: But in the end, it appears that the
Joestars are fated to be my tools.
Jotaro: O-Old man...
Jotaro: O-Old man.
Joseph: No matter...
Joseph: No matter what DIO is about 
to do to my body down below,
Joseph: you must never get enraged 
and lose your cool, Jotaro.
Joseph: Don't worry about me anymore.
Joseph: This happened because it had to happen.
Jotaro: Is this... the old man's soul?
Joseph: Kakyoin solved the mystery of DIO's Stand.
Joseph: I relayed his message to you.
Joseph: If we had all fought DIO at once,
we would have all perished instantly.
Joseph: You've become able to move 
a bit within stopped time.
Joseph: You have two or three seconds now...
Joseph: Use that time wisely.
Joseph: No matter what DIO does now, 
you mustn't get angry.
Joseph: If you fly into a rage and strike first,
you'll only put yourself in a bad situation.
Joseph: Jotaro...
Joseph: This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?
Joseph: So much happened.
Joseph: I swear...
These fifty days really were fun.
Jotaro: Was I seeing things?
DIO: Hey!
DIO: Where are you looking, Jotaro?
Jotaro: B-Bastard...
DIO: Now he's just an empty shell!
Jotaro: The old man told me not to
get angry, no matter what.
Jotaro: But that's not possible.
Jotaro: No one could stay calm after seeing that!
DIO: This is the final round!
DIO: The World!
DIO: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
DIO: The World! Stop time!
DIO: Wryyyyyyyyyy!
DIO: One second has passed! 
Two seconds have passed...
DIO: Three seconds have passed! Four seconds...
DIO: Five seconds have passed.
DIO: Six seconds have passed.
DIO: Seven seconds have passed!
DIO: I still feel the power!
DIO: I can still keep it up!
DIO: By the way, Jotaro.
You shouldn't be able to move any longer.
DIO: You probably gambled on the two seconds
before time starts to move again,
DIO: but you've miscalculated.
DIO: What a truly magnificent feeling!
DIO: I feel so good, I could break out into song!
DIO: Eight seconds have passed!
DIO: One hundred years ago, I attained immortality,
DIO: but I didn't feel as absolutely 
wonderful then as I do now!
DIO: Joestar blood suits me so very well!
DIO: This is the greatest high!
Jotaro (internal): O-Old man... You were right.
Getting mad has gotten me into trouble.
Jotaro (internal): But this isn't the end of it.
Jotaro (internal): I still have plenty more rage to hurl at him!
DIO: Nine seconds have passed!
I've stopped time for nine seconds!
DIO: But it appears that stopping time for 
nine seconds is my current limit.
Jotaro (internal): Y-You bastard...
DIO: Now to unleash all of my Stand's power!
DIO: Jotaro! You said something
about being pissed off...
DIO: But your fury can achieve no more than that!
DIO: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
DIO: Useless!
DIO: And now, without pause, my final attack!
DIO: The last and final time I will stop time!
DIO: Within my nine seconds of 
stopped time, I shall end this!
DIO: The World!
DIO: One second has passed.
DIO: Two seconds have passed.
DIO: Three seconds have passed.
narator: For some reason, DIO disappeared 
while time was stopped.
DIO: Four seconds have passed.
narator: However, Jotaro has abandoned thought.
narator: No matter what DIO has planned,
or what attack he might unleash
in the two seconds that Jotaro 
can move within stopped time,
narator: all he needs to do is drive Star Platinum's
fists into him in those two seconds!
DIO: Five seconds have passed.
Jotaro (internal): The one thing that I know, DIO,
is that the next time I see your face,
I'm probably going to bust a vein!
DIO: Six seconds have passed.
Jotaro (internal): Bring it on, DIO!
DIO: Seven seconds have passed.
DIO: Road roller!
DIO: It's too late! You cannot escape!
DIO: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
DIO: Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
DIO: Eight seconds have passed!
DIO: I'll smash you flat!
DIO: Nine seconds have passed.
DIO: I did it.
DIO: It is over.
Star Platinum has finally been 
defeated by my The World!
DIO: Immortality! Eternal life!
DIO: And Stand power!
DIO: This proves that no one can surpass DIO!
DIO: Puny humans! I shall rule you all!
DIO: Bow before my knowledge and might!
DIO: Ten seconds have passed!
DIO: Now my ability to stop time 
has reached ten seconds!
DIO: Now, then...
I guess I should find Jotaro's 
lifeless body and drink his blood.
DIO: If there's any blood left to take!
DIO: Wh-What?
My body's movements a-are slowing down...
DIO: N-No... I'm not slowing down...
DIO: I-I cannot move. I-Impossible!
DIO: M-My b-body won't move at all!
Jotaro: DIO!
Jotaro: It's been eleven seconds.
I guess that's your limit now.
DIO: What?!
Jotaro: I stopped time at the nine second mark.
That let me escape.
Jotaro: Good grief.
Jotaro: Now...
It won't take even a second to finish you off!
DIO: J-Jotaro!
DIO: I-Impossible! You stopped time?
DIO: Right at the end of my
nine seconds of movement...
Jotaro: How does it feel, DIO?
Jotaro: Having someone approach from behind 
while you can't move a muscle,
if I had to describe it,
Jotaro: is like when a guy who can hold 
his breath underwater for a minute
Jotaro: finally comes up for air at the very last second...
Jotaro: When suddenly, he feels someone 
grab him, and he's dragged
back down into the water.
Jotaro: Does that sound right?
Jotaro: But for you, I feel no pity at all.
Jotaro: Time has begun to move again.
Jotaro: I don't feel even the slightest 
bit of compassion for you.
Jotaro: I haven't even an ounce of pity for you.
Jotaro: However, just finishing you off 
by beating you to death now
would leave a bad taste in my mouth.
Jotaro: How many seconds will it take 
for your legs to recover?
Jotaro: Three seconds? Four?
Jotaro: The moment you've healed, 
I'll throw Star Platinum at you.
Jotaro: So bring it on!
Jotaro: If I were a gunslinger in a Western, I'd say...
Jotaro: "Draw. Let's see who's 
the fastest gun in the West."
DIO (internal): H-He's...
mocking me!
DIO (internal): But... But, Jotaro...
DIO (internal): You may have come this far, 
but you are still only human.
DIO (internal): You think like a human,
who has so little time to live.
DIO (internal): About things leaving a 
bad taste in your mouth,
or living your life with no regrets...
DIO (internal): That kind of reasoning is about 
as compelling as rat shit
in a bathroom, and it will be your demise!
DIO (internal): I, DIO, have no such thoughts.
DIO (internal): Within my mind is but one simple thought.
Just one!
DIO (internal): To be victorious and rule! That is all.
DIO (internal): That is all I need to feel satisfaction!
DIO (internal): How I do it...
DIO: ...does not matter!
DIO: How do you like being blinded by blood?!
DIO: I've won! Die!
DIO: Wha...
DIO: What?!
DIO: I-Impossible... I-I'm DIO...
DIO: I am DIO!
Jotaro: Now if I just wait until dawn, 
you'll turn into dust.
Jotaro: There's only one reason why you lost, DIO.
Jotaro: There's just one simple answer.
Jotaro: You really pissed me off.
person: This is the Speed Wagon Foundation Car Two.
person: We are currently traveling 
north on Al-Nil Street.
person: We have retrieved DIO's body.
person: I repeat. We have retrieved DIO's body.
heli: DIO's body will stay alive until 
it is exposed to sunlight.
Proceed with caution!
heli: Make sure you don't let down your guard.
person: Roger.
heli: Noriaki Kakyoin is dead. We are 
transporting his body via helicopter.
heli: Jean Pierre Polnareff is unconscious.
He is currently being treated in Car One.
person: Roger.
heli: By the way, I've got a
question for you, Car Two...
heli: Why did you put DIO and Joseph 
Joestar's bodies in the same car?
Jotaro: Because it's not over yet.
DIO borrowed something...
Doctor: Huh?
Jotaro: And I need to get it back.
Doctor: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Jotaro: Is it possible to transfuse blood
from one corpse to another?
Doctor: A-Are you suggesting we put DIO's blood 
into Mr. Joestar's withered corpse?
Doctor: Are you trying to bring 
Mr. Joestar back to life?
Jotaro: DIO sucked out his blood just minutes ago.
Jotaro: DIO's upper body has been annihilated,
but I want him to return what he's still got.
Jotaro: Don't you think we can still make it in time?
person: So he says. Did you hear that? Over.
heli: R-Roger...
Doctor: I-It's impossible! He doesn't have a pulse...
Doctor: That means his heart has stopped,
so it's impossible to make blood 
circulate throughout his body!
Jotaro: Impossible?
Jotaro: We did a lot of impossible 
things on this journey.
Jotaro: I'm tired of hearing that things 
are "impossible" or "useless."
Those words mean nothing to us.
Jotaro: You said we have to get 
his heart moving, right?
Jotaro: Good timing.
Thanks to DIO, I've had practice 
with stopping and starting hearts.
Doctor: I hear a pulse!
Doctor: His heart's moving!
Doctor: Hurry! Extract the blood from DIO's
body and perform the transfusion!
Doctor: This just might work!
Doctor: L-Look!
Doctor: His shriveled skin is already regaining color!
Doctor: His flesh is softening and stretching!
Doctor: Brainwaves! We're detecting brainwaves!
Doctor: I can't believe it! His heartbeat is regular!
Doctor: His eyes! He opened his eyes!
Doctor: We did it! He's come back to life!
Jotaro: Old man?
Joseph: You fool, Jotaro!
Jotaro: Y-You bastard! It can't be...
Joseph: Thanks to you, I live again!
Jotaro: You!
Joseph: W-Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding! 
Kidding! I'm just kidding!
Joseph: It's just a joke! A joke!
Joseph: Sorry! I was just messing with you a little.
Joseph: It's definitely me!
Joseph: I'm Joseph Joestar. I was 
born September 27th, 1920.
Joseph: My wife's name is Suzie Q.
I like to collect comic books!
Jotaro: Who's the female lead in the 
1981 film, Tarzan, the Ape Man?
Joseph: Bo Derek.
Jotaro: Who sang the parody of 
"Beat It," named "Eat It"?
Joseph: Al Yankovic.
Jotaro: Good grief. I guess you are the real thing,
if you know pointless crap like that.
person: This is Car Two. It's amazing!
Mr. Joestar has woken up!
person: Mr. Joestar has come back from the dead!
Hooray! Over!
Jotaro: Now you've returned what you took from us,
DIO.
Joseph: Now, it's over.
Joseph: So many people lent something to DIO.
Joseph: Many people, for the last hundred years.
Joseph: They lent him everything.
Jotaro: And too many of those things 
will never be returned.
Joseph: Yeah. The things we can't get back 
are too numerous, and too great.
Joseph: What we've lost is as vast
as the planet Earth itself.
Joseph: But it's all because of them...
Joseph: It's because of them that we still live.
Jotaro: Kakyoin.
Jotaro: Iggy.
Jotaro: Avdol.
Jotaro: It's over.
Joseph: Are you really going back to France, Polnareff?
Joseph: You don't have any more family there, do you?
Why don't you come to New York with me?
Polnareff: Mr. Joestar, even though my family 
is gone, France is my homeland.
Polnareff: I have many memories in my hometown.
Polnareff: No matter where I go,
I'll always return there.
Polnareff: But if you ever need me, give me a call.
Polnareff: Wherever in the world you are, 
I'll come running.
Joseph: It'll be lonely without you.
Polnareff: There were many hardships,
Polnareff: but it was a lot of fun.
That journey was fun 
because all of you were there.
Joseph: Yeah.
Yes, it was fun. I believe that 
from the bottom of my heart.
announcer: Passengers on France International 
Airlines Flight 92,
bound for Paris, please head to Gate 18.
Polnareff: Well, see ya, you shit-stained geezer!
I hope you live forever!
Polnareff: And you, his stingy grandson! 
Don't you dare forget me!
Joseph: Let us meet again!
If you don't hate me by then, 
you little jackass!
Jotaro: I couldn't forget a guy like you if I tried.
Jotaro: Take care.
Polnareff: So long.
Joseph: Yeah.
Jotaro: So long.
Suzi: Holly...
Suzi: Why are you sitting up all of a sudden?
Holly: I... Suddenly, I feel so much better!
Holly: And I just felt it in my heart...
Suzi: What?
Holly: They're both coming home, Mama!
Suzi: Holly!
Holly: Papa and Jotaro!
Holly: They're coming home!
