Jotaro: It should be about time.
Polnareff: Wh-What's that?
Joseph: They're here.
Polnareff: It's a helicopter!
Kakyoin: You don't have to state the obvious.
We can see that.
Joseph: That's a helicopter from 
the Speedwagon Foundation.
Joseph: They're looking for a place to land.
Jotaro: Speedwagon Foundation?
Jotaro: Your old friends who are taking
care of Mom back in Japan?
Joseph: Yeah, that's right.
Jotaro: Don't tell me we're going 
for a ride in that helicopter.
Joseph: No. As much as I'd like to, 
the crew aren't Stand users.
Joseph: If we were attacked, they would be at risk.
Kakyoin: Then why is that helicopter here?
Joseph: They've brought us a helper.
Polnareff: What? A helper?
Joseph: He has a few personality issues,
so it's taken a while to get him here.
Avdol: Mr. Joestar!
Avdol: It's impossible for him to 
come with us on this trip!
Avdol: There's no way he could be helpful.
Kakyoin: Do you know him, Avdol?
Avdol: Yeah, very well.
Jotaro: Hold on. If he's a helper,
that means he's a Stand user, right?
Joseph: He's the Stand user whose Stand
suggests the card called The Fool.
Jotaro: The Fool?
Polnareff: The Fool?
Hah! That card sounds like an idiot.
Avdol: We're lucky that he's not our enemy.
Avdol: You wouldn't be able to beat him.
Polnareff: What'd you say, you asshole?
You'd better watch your mouth.
Avdol: It's the truth.
And what's with the hand? That hurts.
Polnareff: Sounding all high-and-mighty and shit...
Kakyoin: Knock it off already.
Kakyoin: The helicopter landed.
guy 1: Mr. Joestar! Thank goodness you're safe.
Joseph: Thanks for coming out here. I appreciate it.
Jotaro: So...
Jotaro: Who's the Stand user?
Jotaro: I'm asking which one of you is the Stand user.
Jotaro: Is it you?
guy 1: No, it's not either of us.
He's in the back seat.
Jotaro: The back seat...
Jotaro: I don't see anyone there.
guy 1: No, he's there.
Polnareff: Hey, hey, hey!
You say he's there, but where is he?
Polnareff: Is he really short or something?
Polnareff: Get the hell out here! Come on!
guy 2: W-Watch out!
Polnareff: Hm?
What's this sticky stuff?
guy 2: Please, be careful!
guy 1: The helicopter ride was rough,
so he's in a really bad mood.
Joseph: Don't get close to him!
Joseph: I told you, he's got some personality issues!
Avdol: Polnareff, you can't win.
Polnareff: And I'm asking where the hell he is—
Polnareff: Whoa!
Polnareff: H-H-H-H-H-He's...
Kakyoin: ...a dog!
Jotaro: Don't tell me this dog is....
Joseph: Yes! He is The Fool Stand's user.
Joseph: His name is Iggy.
Joseph: He loves to tear out human hair by the mouthful.
Joseph: We don't know where he was born.
Joseph: When even the dog catchers in 
New York couldn't get him,
Joseph: Avdol was able to find and finally capture him.
Joseph: Oh, I just remembered.
Joseph: While he's ripping out hair, he likes to...
Joseph: fart in the human's face.
He's kind of vulgar.
Polnareff: God damn it! You're gonna pay for that!
Polnareff: Damn you...
Polnareff: Chariot!
Polnareff: Th-That's...
Jotaro: So that's The Fool.
Kakyoin: We met an orangutan Stand user
off the shore of Singapore, but...
Polnareff: Who the hell do you think 
you are, you stupid mutt?!
Polnareff: Don't make me cut you in half!
Polnareff: What the?! It's like it's turning into sand...
Polnareff: I-I can't cut it!
Polnareff: Now it became solid and swallowed up my sword!
Kakyoin: That's...
Avdol: Simply put, it's a Stand made of sand.
Jotaro: Yeah... And the simpler they are,
the stronger they are.
Jotaro: I'm not sure if I could hit it.
Polnareff: Hey! Help! Do something about this dog!
Polnareff: Sorry, Polnareff,
but I'm not about to get 
my hair ripped out, too.
Polnareff: You monster!
Avdol: Do you have his treats?
guy 1: If we didn't, we wouldn't 
have been able to make it here.
Polnareff: Stop! Help me!
Avdol: His sense of smell is incredible.
Kakyoin: What is that?
Avdol: Coffee-flavored chewing gum.
It's Iggy's favorite treat, 
and he'll do anything for it.
guy 1: Mr. Avdol! Keep the box hidden from—
Avdol: Oh, no! He got the box!
Joseph: He loves coffee-flavored chewing gum,
but he still won't let down his guard for anyone.
Avdol: At least take the paper off first.
Kakyoin: There's no way he could actually help us.
Jotaro: Good grief.
Polnareff: Damn it...
My beautiful hair's been thinned...
Polnareff: You stupid bastard!
guy 1: While he's eating the gum, he should be fine.
guy 1: Let's get the supplies out now.
guy 1: Here's some food and water for your trip.
Joseph: Oh, thank you.
guy 1: There are medical supplies 
and a change of clothes, too.
guy 1: Also, a new camera, for taking spirit pictures.
Joseph: TVs don't work so well for spirit photography.
Joseph: Oh, I know.
Hey, you guys.
Kakyoin: I see. It'll make a nice memory.
Polnareff: Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!
Avdol: But you're already such good friends, Polnareff!
guy 1: Mr. Joestar, we'll be taking our leave now.
Joseph: There's something I'd like to ask you.
Joseph: About my daughter...
Joseph: How is Holly doing?
Give it to me straight.
guy 1: Well, sir... I hate to say this,
but I'm afraid she's not doing very well.
guy 1: Her energy is fading, 
and her life remains in danger.
guy 1: According to the doctors from 
our Speedwagon Foundation,
guy 1: she'll be lucky if she survives 
for another two weeks.
Kakyoin: There's no time.
Polnareff: Damn it...
guy 1: Also, we have some information for you.
guy 1: According to the report, two days ago...
guy 1: Nine mysterious men and women
gathered in a building that DIO 
is believed to be hiding in,
and then they all departed together.
Joseph: DIO and nine others?
guy 1: We don't know who they are.
The person who reported this was killed,
and the mansion had already been cleared out.
guy 1: We were unable to locate 
the nine men and women.
guy 1: Any further investigation of
this matter is impossible for us,
since we are not Stand users.
Were they new Stand users?
Kakyoin: Hold on.
Kakyoin: Any remaining Stand users with Stands that
suggest Tarot cards...
Excluding Hol Horse's Emperor,
Kakyoin: the only card left is The World.
Kakyoin: I had thought that The World 
would be DIO's Stand, but...
Kakyoin: Avdol?
Avdol: I-I don't know.
I have no idea. Nine of them?
Joseph: Apparently, DIO's head hasn't 
gotten used to its new body yet.
Joseph: DIO is very proud, so there's 
no way he'd flee from Cairo.
Joseph: It would appear that he's trying 
to stop us from reaching Cairo.
Jotaro: Good grief. There's only two 
weeks left, and nine of them...
Jotaro: We might end up a little tired.
guy 1: We'll be off, then.
guy 1: Please have a safe trip.
Joseph: Thank you. Take care of Holly.
Ndoul: That dog...
It noticed the presence of the Great N'doul, eh?
Ndoul: Damn. So close.
I was almost able to get it.
I guess I need more practice.
Ndoul: The Nile Ue Ue Fly, eh...
Ndoul: It's because of this fly 
that Joestar and the others
were able to pursue Lord DIO this far...
Polnareff: Mr. Joestar, can't you 
do something about this?
Polnareff: Why is that shitty little dog sitting in
the seat while we're stuck in the back?
Polnareff: It's so cramped, my back hurts.
Joseph: You'll have to wait until the flavor from his
beloved coffee gum fades.
Joseph: Once that happens, I'll throw 
a new piece of gum into
the back so he'll go there.
Joseph: Then you can change seats.
Polnareff: All right, all right. Calm down! Damn it...
Polnareff: Wh-What the hell?!
Joseph: L-Look! Over there!
Joseph: Th-That's...
The helicopter!
Kakyoin: The Speedwagon Foundation helicopter 
that flew off earlier is down in the sand!
Avdol: There's no sign that it was attacked.
Kakyoin: It's like it just fell to the ground.
Polnareff: It couldn't be!
Joseph: Be careful!
It's very likely we'll be 
attacked by the enemy's Stand!
Jotaro: Look! It's the pilot!
Jotaro: He's dead...
Jotaro: There are marks where he
clawed the helicopter's side...
Joseph: This is horrible.
Joseph: Approach carefully.
Something could be hiding there.
Jotaro: It's water.
Jotaro: So much water...
It's coming from the pilot's mouth...
No, from his lungs.
Jotaro: There's even a small fish.
Jotaro: He drowned in the middle of the desert!
Joseph: What on earth?
Polnareff: H-Hey...
Polnareff: The other one's over here.
Polnareff: He's alive!
Joseph: Are you all right? Get a hold of yourself!
What on earth happened?
Wa...
guy 1: Water...
Joseph: What? You want water?
Polnareff, hand me that canteen.
Polnareff: Right.
Joseph: Here, get a hold of yourself. 
Here's some water.
Joseph: Drink slowly.
guy1: No! The water's going to attack!
Joseph: What?!
Joseph: I-It's the enemy Stand!
Joseph: The enemy Stand is inside the canteen!
Joseph: D-Damn it!
Joseph: The Speedwagon Foundation crew wasn't
part of this fight,
but they were still attacked!
Joseph: Avdol, did you see what kind of Stand it was?
Avdol: I only saw a hand.
But it's still inside the canteen!
Avdol: I haven't seen it leave.
Avdol: Who could it be?
They mentioned that DIO 
gathered nine men and women...
Avdol: Is the attacker one of them, then?
Joseph: Jotaro, locate the enemy's body.
Jotaro: I'm looking for it right now.
But...
Jotaro: The enemy's body isn't anywhere I can see.
Jotaro: I even looked for something like 
that stupid mirror The Sun had.
Jotaro: But it seems the enemy is 
operating from very far away.
Kakyoin: Polnareff, attack the canteen.
Polnareff: Huh? Me...?
Polnareff: Th-The pilot's head was completely 
sucked into that tiny little canteen.
Polnareff: So if I poke a hole in that thing...
Polnareff: Hell no!
Polnareff: Kakyoin! You're closer!
You should just hit it with an Emerald Splash!
Kakyoin: I don't want to.
Polnareff: Don't try to make someone do
something you won't do yourself!
Polnareff: What the hell is wrong with you?!
Kakyoin: No means no.
Polnareff: Well, I say that I don't want to do it, either!
Kakyoin: Th-This is...
Polnareff: Kakyoin!
Joseph: It's the water!
It had already left the canteen,
along with the blood!
Avdol: It's not that the Stand was 
inside the canteen...
The water is the Stand!
Polnareff: It got Kakyoin!
Polnareff: I-It got Kakyoin's eyes!
Joseph: Polnareff! Stop panicking!
Bring out Chariot and defend yourself!
Jotaro: Crap. It's going to get Polnareff, too.
Joseph: What's going on?
It attacked the pilot's corpse!
Jotaro: No, not the corpse. The watch.
Jotaro: It attacked the watch's alarm.
Avdol: Sound! It attacks by locating sounds!
Polnareff: Sounds?
Joseph: Shit! Polnareff!
It's coming for you this time!
Joseph: Run to the vehicle!
Polnareff: I-It's so fast!
Joseph: Hurry, Polnareff!
Polnareff: It cut me!
Joseph: Hermit Purple!
Avdol: It soaked into the ground...
Joseph: The enemy can detect sound 
through vibrations in the ground.
Joseph: It can move freely around underground,
Joseph: without being seen, and before we know it,
it can attack us from behind, 
or through the bottoms of our feet.
Joseph: And its user is able to remain far away.
Ndoul: They all got onto their vehicle.
He must have realized that I, 
N'doul, was finding them with sound.
Ndoul: Too bad figuring that out 
won't do them any good...
Polnareff: H-How's Kakyoin?
Avdol: It's not good.
He may have been blinded.
Avdol: Let's drive.
We have to get him to a doctor immediately.
Joseph: But if we move, it'll attack.
Joseph: We can't be careless.
Joseph: What?!
Ndoul: These footsteps... It's the dog.
Ndoul: That dog...
It left the car before my attack.
Ndoul: It anticipated my Stand's attack.
Ndoul: It seems that dog is going 
to be a problem after all.
Jotaro: The tires are in the water! Shit!
Jotaro: It's no use. We're being pulled in!
Avdol: We're going to slip!
Joseph: Move further back!
Polnareff: Helper! Come on, damn it! Help, already! Hey!
Ndoul: That accursed dog...
It must also know that I'm
only four kilometers to the west.
Ndoul: What should I do...
Ndoul: I'll have to take care of the dog first!
Polnareff: How careless can you be?!
You stupid dog!
Ndoul: No, I'll leave the dog alone.
It doesn't appear that Joestar
and the others can control that dog.
Ndoul: If it's just going to sleep, it's harmless.
Ndoul: Now, without hesitation...
Joseph: It's so sharp!
It cut the front tires in half!
Joseph: Go even further back!
Joseph: S-So that's what it's trying to do...
Shit! Everyone hang on!
