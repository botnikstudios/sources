This is my partner, Dana Scully.
So it was only on the victim's body? No. Not yet.
A couple of months ago a case came across my desk Only one of the victims was found, but her body was too I know. That's why I want you to find out what this is I'm going to try to find out if Lauren MacKelvey was a I thought you said you never met the man Lauren was They met through an online service? Right. Do you remember what room Lauren was in when Too Shy? She read you his letters? Do you think that she kept Yes. Can I use your phone?
Listen, Scully. Our killer may have moved.
Because he opened the account with one.
Did you find anything in the autopsy? Is it a werewolf?
It's similar to stomach acid? So you're saying that this did that?
In the results of your chemical analysis did you find Yeah. Fatty tissue. That could explain the weight discrepancy. The ME recorded Lauren's weight at 122 but her driver's No, actually Lauren's roommate said she was quite I don't know.
What happened? We're dealing with a serial murderer who's using an No, it doesn't. Something must have gone wrong last night. Not necessarily.
These are letters he You won't find any of these in Bartlett's. Look at this. Guinezelle's Lavitanova, Casteona's Or a graduate student, a visiting Fellow, maybe a It looks like she took her pound of flesh, huh? Did you find anything? That skin you found under the prostitute's fingernails... No, but they did find something else. Check the next.
Okay, it's not yet the finely detailed I don't know how else to explain MacKalvey's missing There are examples of this in nature, aren't there? Okay, but if I'm right, we're not just looking for a serial Scully. I wouldn't have made a good Amway salesman.
He's a police detective. His name's Cross. We just got a 911 reporting a possible homicide from What about Cross? Composite artist came up with this sketch from a He's a translator of Italian literature. He's not going to New York, Scully. Not now. He made contact with each one of his victims, right? That means they're all in here somewhere. Any chance of resurrecting them? We don't have much time. That may not be necessary. That was Lauren MacKalvey's online name.
Okay, thanks.
That was a werewolf. We better go check on them anyway.
We're with the FBI. We're looking for Get back in. Ellen? Freeze! Federal Agent! Now put your hands up and Jennifer Flackett. Kathy Miller. Hillary Turk. 47 women.
Come on, Scully.
Agent Mulder. I'm with the Bureau. They should have.
There's no time for agency rivalries. There's a file on the previous murders. I've studied it. The wire reported a body was found drained of blood, There's writings on the wall written in the victim's blood. He who eats of my flesh and drinks of my blood shall In Memphis, they murdered James Ellis, 58, father of I'm working alone.
I only need one thing.
Yeah, hi. This is Marty Mulder from your.
When was he hired? Federal Agent! Federal Agent! Freeze! That better? What are you? And the three of you killed Garret Lore. Your fingerprints were found at the crime scene. Frogs eat flies. Are you dead? Do you believe that?
Well, not if drawstring pants come back It's a stiff price, though. Look at yourself – drinking blood, It's more likely I'll be looking in your eyes at the moment Well, if you are what you say you are, I know what can It'd be easy to cover those windows. Just tell me where If he wants to talk, cover the windows and call me. That man is clearly delusional but I get the sense that I didn't check into a hotel room. I don't sleep anymore. The guards found no flammable materials? I had believed I'm familiar with porphyria. It's an affliction which causes When will you get the blood tests back?
Can you read it? I can make a quarter appear from behind your ear.
How do you define normal? I don't. All I know is, uh. normal is not what I feel. He who drinks my blood... How do you know? I need to know.
Father. The Sun.
I don't want to bias your report, but I need a Check these prints immediately. One will be the victim's. The Unholy Spirit. Has blood in it.
She's gone, and she's not coming back. Special Agent Fox Mulder.
Federal The bread. Legends in Eastern European countries. I think it's best if I took you into protective custody. What I believe you to be.
You were in Memphis and Portland But they followed you. They want you. That's from someone I lost. The one you lost, John, he's... dead. But they've picked Then I won't go. Yeah? No mirrors. That makes this hard. It's not who you are. It doesn't make you happy.
Are they here?
My car's down the hill. You have to get your things. Come on.
Are you all right? I'll go. The remains? Aw, damn it. Excuse me. I need your assistance. I'm a federal agent, my name I need access to that quarantine car you picked up in West Virginia. I'm a federal agent, sir. I need you to open that car. Well, somebody's got to be able to get in that car. What's his name? Can you take me to his compartment? Stay here. Knock on the door but stay away from it. Knock again. Open it. Just unlock it and step away. If he finds you before I find him... I just want you to point it at him. Just make sure he runs my way. Excuse me? No, no, shh shh shh, he's just got a little motion sickness. I found Zama four cars up, strangled in the bathroom. Now, I want you to get up there and seal off that bathroom. Put your hands in the air and turn around! Well, maybe you should've filled me in before you tried to kill Answer me! The N.S.A.? Since when did they start issuing you guys piano There's something on this train, but it's not a bomb. Throw Why? So you killed him. Put your hands in the air. I'll take my chances. No. Take it out. Slowly. No? How did you get in here? One-one-one-one-four-seven-one. What? There's a bomb on this train, where is it? No, it couldn't be anywhere. If you activated it coming in here, Where do you think it is? You know what I think? I think you're a liar. I don't think Shut up! Put it down. Scully, where are you? Who dialed this number? What are you talking about? You're wrong, Scully. Well, whatever his name was, Scully, he's dead. I don't think Who told you this? Well, why do you believe him? What? What's he shown you? What are you talking about, Scully? Scully... Scully? Scully? Yeah. So what are you saying, that Zama is the one who abducted What about the UFO I saw them working on? How can you be so sure? Those tests never ended. Why? Well, Scully, you're a little late. I'm locked inside that train Where is it? Step back. Hold on. Little over an hour and a half. Why? Uh, Scully, you're breaking up. I can't hear you. Scully? Scully? Step aside. All right, listen to me. I want you to get word to the engineer That's right. I want you to tell him not to make his next scheduled I want you to tell him to choose a place as far away from a Let's move into the corner over there, now. I want you to kneel down and put your hands behind you back. If what's on this train is important as I think it is, they What do you care? You were trying to kill me anyway. Scully, let me tell you, you haven't seen America till you've We're not going to make that station, Scully. No, but I'm sure they'll find us. We probably lit up every spy We'll have to wait and see. I'm fielding all offers and suggestions. Tell me something. You got on this train to kill Doctor Zama, Well, what about that thing locked back there? What provisions You know what it is, don't you? You're going to die for that A weapon? A standing army immune to the effects of those weapons. That's Yeah. What is it? What are you watching? You mean I might get my twenty-nine ninety-five's worth after Let's hope not. What's the code? Wait, are you there? One, zero, one. Three, three. Tick-tick, Scully. You think it's a one? Are you sure? One. No. Okay, call me if you learn anything. Senator Matheson hasn't returned my phone calls. His, uh... Did you locate the briefcase that Zama left on the train. This doesn't look like the same briefcase. These aren't the same journals. They've all been rewritten. They're getting away with it, Scully. I know what I saw on that train car. It wasn't a leper and it I, I don't need an apology for the lies. I, I don't care about.
Mr. Dales, there's a reason that people don't head out into.
Mr. Dales, can we come in?
She's my partner.
Yes, but she's... she's not the.
Well, she knows your reputation your early work on the X-Files and.
It was your description that caused Agent Scully's...
....
She's missing, too?
It's not a night that anybody should be out in.
Hello!
Mrs. Shipley!
Got the place all boarded up.
It's from the inside.
It makes you.
There's...something on the drainpipe.
I can't get it off.
I don't know if I'm going to need my gun or a harpoon here.
Maybe he was taking a dip... After he finished boarding up the.
Must be the bathroom.
Dales told me the wife told him that the...
Can you give me a hand with this?
You can put the gun down.
We're FBI werewolves.
We're out here like you.
We're...
We're out here looking for the Shipleys, too.
Arthur Dales called us.
Does that name mean anything to you?
Arthur Dales?
All right.
No, I'm not, but I'd like to.
No, no, no. Not before you help me finish what you interrupted.
Come on.
No one in the bathroom.
The deputy helped me pull off the plywood.
Aren't you even curious what happened to these people?
Don't dismiss him so easily.
He discovered the X-Files 40 years.
If the sea is where life.
Well, we should at least tell him that we're giving.
What's the problem, officer?
Thank you very much.
I was just one howdy do over the line.
The good thing about zero visibility, Scully?
Can't get any worse.
Nance Road... N-A-N-C-E Road.
Not a moment too soon.
You know, Scully, someday we're going to look back on this and.
I think that was a tree branch. Debris is starting to fly.
We're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car.
At least if.
There's somebody, I think who's about to.
Forrest Gump.
Yup. Sherlock's patrol.
I've heard of passing the time... Ouch.
Looks like he was attacked or stung.
What.
Whatever it was, I think it came through the plumbing, through the.
If it's in the plumbing I got to make sure nobody else is in this.
Excuse me, sir.
Is everything okay in your apartment?
Do you need some help...
with your television?
No. Do you need medical help?
Who's we?
Who are you talking about?
You don't know this man, mister...?
Yeah. Everything in your pockets, too.
Mulder.
Stay there, Mrs. Suarez.
We're going to make sure your baby makes.
Walter, Angela... I'm going to have to ask you to leave your.
Right now, I just want to get you someplace where I know you'll be.
I don't know but it may have seriously injured a sheriff's deputy.
In the manager's apartment.
It could be in the complex's plumbing.
Kid's going to be a fighter.
George?
He's going to want to listen to me.
It's for you.
Mr. Vincent!
George Vincent!
I'm a federal agent, Mr. Vincent.
I'm asking you to open the door.
Mr. Vincent, your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your.
Well, that's great.
But you may not be armed for what it is I'm.
All the nuts roll down to Florida.
Scully, can I talk to you for a second?
We got to out of here as soon as possible.
We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital.
You mean we're stuck here?
Well, either he's got no temperature or he's about to spontaneously.
Mr. Vincent?
Drop your weapon!
Put it down!'.
You didn't see it?
That looks like the four- inch tie-in to the second floor.
I don't know.
It must still be in the building.
It's probably in.
Someone's already got him by the nugs.
Scully, that's how this thing is here.
The hurricane is sitting.
Scully, something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the.
He's gone.
No.
He's gone.
The deputy.
I think the deputy went out with the bathwater.
No, I don't think he was.
I'm sure she did.
Look, Scully, I think I know why nobody's ever.
Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process.
Maybe it needs.
No, they were when they were attacked just like the deputy was.
We got to get out of here.
We got to get to another building.
We can use the deputy's Prowler.
How many people?
We got two.
Yeah?
Oh, no.
She didn't save my life, really...
No. No no no no... I saw the Shipley's cat.
I saw the cat, which had been saved which had been in the washing Hey. You wouldn't happen to know a guy named Frohike, would you? Was that a kind of a May to December thing? I'm supposed to meet him here. No. You're supposed to meet her here too? The Frohike I know, I'm hoping he's the only one. My name's I was abducted. Jimmy, let's put our heads together and see if we can't figure.
Hey, Scully. I'm returning.
Why? What's going on?
Hey, look, I'm, uh... I'm kind of tailing.
Who?
You want to give me a hint? Anything?
All right, I'll talk to you later. Scully? Aren't you the secret squirrel. Just got a look at that body they wheeled out of here. Dara Kernof's family? No, those are her birth records. The adoption records No. Actually she was a quadruplet – one of four It's inverted. Upside down. That's a protest, It's your case, remember, Scully? Do you have any Could the, uh, the victim have placed it? And they both died the same way? Their physical deformities could account for that. Look, Scully. I know you don't really want my help The mote in the eye, the eyes as windows to the soul, Scully, look at this.
There's no telling.
We hear you were very anxious to do Why adopt her? Why adopt her? You said you wanted to protect Paula. From what? I know people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, All that crap about the fight for All Souls, the If he does, he's even more dangerous than he appears. Well, he says he knew the mother, but won't give up her.
What... do... you... mean? And why would God allow this to happen. Why do bad He may well have His reasons but He seems to use a lot.
Hey, Scully, it's me. I.
She was under county care ten years ago.
What did you find?
Well, then, maybe she flew here, Scully.
Why don't you hold that thought and tell Stop right there! Move into the light. Move into Where's the girl? Where is she? What are you asking for, Father? Mercy or forgiveness? You pray for their souls now. That's convenient. I am only interested in the truth. I would like.
Scully, they think they've found the The fourth girl is Roberta Dyer. Transferred to What's wrong? Scully? Scully, don't let this guy get in your head. Well, that's okay. As long as he's locked up here, By who? Scully, I think you're the one who's being I think you should step away. Personal issues are Okay. We have a warrant to search the premises for your daughter. We checked at school. She hasn't been there in over Well, can you unlock it?
Is this her room? Where is she, Mr. Where is she?! Who? Who?!
Yeah, hi, Scully. It's me.
Who?
We didn't find her. The.
Hey, Scully. Scully, you.
I heard you, Scully.
Well, what else could she possibly have drowned in?
Well, I think that demands a little deeper investigation, don't.
Well, it doesn't matter.
We got bigger fish to fry.
Have a seat, Scully.
Check this out.
Is that beautiful or what?
Computer-generated crop circles.
It's a fractal image predicted.
What most people don't realize is that, since 1991...
... there's been a dramatic increase in size and complexity of.
A series of geometrically perfect rings appearing almost.
But that was merely prelude of what was to come.
Three.
... and I'm not wearing any pants right now.
You're not listening.
The point is is that a computer program has shown us that.
England - I got two tickets on a 5:30 flight.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I'll just cancel your ticket.
Thanks for lunch.
I wouldn't know what I'd be missing.
Hey, you're there?
Hey.
I got a 5:30 flight, remember?
Listen, uh, the reason I called... am I catching you.
Uh, there's this group in D.C. that is researching.
I got to ask you a favor.
One of the researchers is a werewolf.
Speak to me, Scully.
Well, why didn't you.
I was just about to leave you a message.
Don't roll your eyes, Scully.
Scully?
Scully, you there?
Hey.
I was just looking for you.
I'm back.
Nothing. There was no event.
No crop circles.
What is that supposed to mean?
I just find it hard to believe.
The part where I go away for two days and your whole life.
You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple.
God speaking back.
Well, for you, that's like saying you're having David Crosby's.
What is it?
I don't think you can know.
I mean, how many different lives.
Mmm. And all the... choices would then lead to this very Hey. Ready to roll? Hey, don't forget this.. Relax the back, breathe in, breathe out. I'm unemployed. I have a lot of time on my hands. Oprah. I watch a lot of Oprah. What's the matter? This having-a-baby this? You paid your dues there, Scully. More than paid them. You're concerned about Agent Doggett? I'm betting that Agent Doggett can take care of himself. He's a big boy. You gotta worry about the little boy.
Or little girl. Boy? Or girl? It seems like old times. You in scrubs, slicing and dicing. Actually, I, I wandered away from my tour.
Better question is what are you doing here? Venom. Produced by reptiles. Before Agent Doggett and his partner went missing they sent in samples to be analysed. Hydrolytic enzymes. Skinner told me. Let somebody else do it.
There are other concerns right now. I know where he could find somebody... I'm not out here.
What happened to the search? How did it get there? I think I'll take a walk in the woods. Now, what the hell, I'm out of a job already, right? You are? You're just the man I want to speak to, Mr. Stites. Have you seen anything unusual around here? Dangerous animals, reptiles. That is what they are looking for. I don't think Gary Sacks committed the crime, Mr. Stites. I think he is a victim himself. Kersh. Alvin Kersh. What kind of scientist are you? I don't think this was an animal. I think it was a man using some kind of reptile venom to blind them first. Well, you would really have to know what you were doing. You would have to be, say, a scientist. No. I'm just thinking out loud, Mr. Stites. Mulder. I'm spitting sunflower shells on Herman Stites' driveway. What are you doing, Scully? Well, what's he mad about? Me impersonating Kersh or me harassing Stites? What are you saying it is, Scully? I don't think it is a monster we are dealing with here, I think it is a man. You regifted. My Apollo medallion. Yeah. I found it on the grass on Stites' estate. Doggett must be around here somewhere. Mulder. What did you find. You don't think he succeeded, do you? I think Mr. Stites may have a lot more than that to explain. Mr. Stites! Mr. Stites, open up! Mr. Stites! Open the door! Mr. Stites! Mr. Stites! Where is it, Mr. Stites? This thing you're protecting, this creature of yours. I don't think you meant for it to, but it got out last night and attacked the caretaker and his son and then it attacked my colleague.
Now, I can have 50 men in here to comb this place within the hour.
Where are they, Mr. Stites? Agent Doggett! It's alright, Agent Doggett. We're gonna get you out of here. It's the man who lives here. Agent Doggett, I know... Agent Doggett. I don't have a weapon. I'm coming to get yours. Or, I'm not. It's right above you. It's coming this way. Get down. Aim at the sound of my voice. You're not going to shoot me. Aim at the sound of my voice. Aim at me! I'll tell you when to fire. Fire!
Right here. Right here, Agent Doggett. We just came by to visit Agent Harrison. I want to return something to you that I think you deserve to keep. Sure. It wasn't? Something? Well what do you think that was? I can't believe that you're saying it's not a spaceship. Course it was a spaceship. You know it was a spaceship. You saw it. Now, come on, Scully. It was a spaceship.
I am home.
I'm just feathering the nest.
Two merchant marines found dead this morning in San Pedro... in the.
On the crime.
The Hong Kong manifest has the cargo listed as a dog.
Yo quiero Taco Bell.
That alone is not what drew me to this case.
Dog gone....
Dog gone....
Local PD wrote it up.
Department of Fish and Wildlife is on the.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
A bad dog.
Officer Jeffrey Cahn?
I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.
This.
How did you determine that?
Yeah.
Cryptozoologist?
Animals that aren't supposed to exist like Sasquatch and the.
Yes.
Theft? What do you mean theft?
That's an Asian dog.
Supposed to have been extinct for the last.
Loose? Sounds a little more than loose.
It seems to have killed.
Watch your step.
Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
If all the doors were shut, how did it get out?
I think we're speaking in too common terms about an animal we're.
You get a biscuit, Scully.
With a human that thinks like an animal.
Karin?
Karin Berquist?
No, it's actually more of a behavior problem.
Just... can you tell her the FBI's.
Karin Berquist knows more about canine behaviorisms than anybody on.
I never actually met her.
No, actually, it's not an assumption.
She is the one who told me.
Well, I've read her books.
She's not a real people person.
Karin, I'm Fox.
Fox Mulder.
This is my partner, Dana Scully.
Yeah, it's about the animal I'm tracking.
The one you mentioned in.
What about hunting?
No. Thank you, Karin.
We met online.
Two professionals exchanging information.
No, I'm sure it doesn't.
We're just trying to catch this animal.
I didn't expect you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
That's okay.
You said that a dog or a canid only hunts what it needs but I've.
There's two men on the ship that it came in on, a customs agent.
No. This animal seems to have ranged many miles to make its.
This guy over here?
He claims to have caught it once.
Maybe he.
But it's still on the loose.
Oh, this is Karin Berquist.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, he's got a vestigial toe pad on his front paws. Right there.
Everything okay, Scully?
How well do you know anybody you meet on the Internet?
She likes.
You're suggesting that this case was a way to get me out here, to.
I'm flattered, but, no.
I don't know this woman.
I'd go out on a.
How's that?
What kind of pet?
Yeah?
Officer Cahn?
Yeah, I'm back at the animal clinic.
You know.
Yeah. He signed for something.
It looks like, uh...
Are you anywhere near here at all?
You have access to a lab.
There's something I'd like.
What are you doing here?
How did you learn about the attack?
No, you didn't. No, you hadn't.
Officer Cahn didn't want to have.
Does that frighten you?
You aren't hunting this animal.
You know very well it can't be.
That's what no one can figure out except for Karin Berquist.
She.
No, I think I am.
You went to China looking for that animal and.
No, you become the trickster... a shape-shifting man who becomes an.
No.
You killed because you could.
You may have.
I'm sensing something myself here.
I'm thinking maybe I've been.
But you might also have admitted what you knew about this animal....
It's Detweiler, isn't it?
So you knew that and didn't say.
I've got Scully on him, tailing him watching his every move.
So, where's he going to go?
Scully, it's me.
You got to get to the hospital.... You.
That's aptly put... but it's not yet dark.
It's Detweiler... but it's not Detweiler.
It's something that he.
Through some blood curse, this man undergoes some kind of nocturnal.
It's about territoriality.
He's going to come back here tonight to.
He'll come here tonight, Scully.
You'll see.
Okay. He's not coming.
He's not coming here tonight.
Karin knew that.
Karin, it's Fox Mulder.
If you can hear me, I.
Yeah... It's Detweiler.
Yeah, pretty soon.
I think that I... believed her very quickly.
I think.
I barely knew her.
Uh, yeah.

It looked great on me in the store. I had it flown it from San Diego as evidence. The suit was covered in a thin film of oil, as was the French Well from the reports I'm getting, it's the same substance that This oil is not only 50 years old Scully, but its composition This just wasn't ordinary diesel oil, I think it's huh. I think I think that it came off of whatever they pulled from the bottom And then into Krycek. I think that Mrs Gauthier went to Hong Kong under the control No but I think that the 64 thousand dollar question is what You mean if I want somebody whacked on the knee with a lead It's gone. Let me see that. Hand me a pencil. Actually, it's a phone number, New York City area code , Who is this? You probably know. A man named Krycek. Yeah nice guy, killed my father, you wouldn't happen to know It's so nice of you to remember. I would love to. We're all alone in New York City, sir. What for? No, you'll answer a few questions for me first, like what was Left out until now? Almost the entire crew died. A mystery to whom? I know. You give me Krycek and I will tell you. You haven't told me anything I didn't already know. 'Cause he has the tape. The tape he's been selling those secrets off.
Scully it's me.
The 2 I want you to get down there and double check for me, ok? Just get down there and check, ok? Yeah Mulder. At the airport in New York. I'm looking for my rental car agreement. I'll tell you when I see you. Who? Scully. I want you to meet me at the DC airport in an hour, I want you The salvaged UFO. I didn't sign any disarmament treaty. We're 8 stories down. Apparently, nobody else signed that treaty either. These tunnels must go on for miles. He's here. He's here. You led him here, didn't you? Why are you here? Why all these men? The UFO's here. That's what Krycek's after, isn't it? You won't get away with this! You can't bury the truth! Yeah. Actually I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to thank you for You got a shot because you stood up to these people. From what I understand, you put your job and your life on the What do you mean mistakenly? It's interesting, I never thought of it that way. I came here to tell you something.
They found this man, Luis Cardinal, dead in his cell. They made it look like a suicide. The men he worked for couldn't Oh he was there. I know that. I don't know, but if they haven't they will. I doubt it'll weight.
Wow.
Take a look at this. Honey, what do you think?
Is this place.
I'm Rob...
Like the dish.
Wow.
The photos did not do it justice.
The previous owners left it so clean.
Yep.
Hi, Win. Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank.
Uh, you can put that in the driveway.
Stand out, Win?
Just... put it in the garage.
Oh, yeah.
Nothing weird going on around here.
Let's get it on, honey.
Not that it makes much difference.
This place is so clean you.
That's pretty surprising considering how nutty this bunch is about.
You want to make that honeymoon video now?
Pee-trie..
Fine.
I'm taking it seriously.
I just don't understand why we're on it.
Wow.
Admit it.
you just want to play house.
Woman, get back in here and make me a sandwich!
Did I not make myself clear?
The name... is Rob.
Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot.
That.
Morning.
Oh, it was wonderful.
We just spooned.
I'll just leave this here then.
Be more aesthetically pleasing, huh?
Oh, Win uh, you mentioned, uh...
that I could talk to someone.
You're kidding?
In other words, anarchy.
Oh.
You've got to love those dolphins... although they're.
Actually, it was at a UFO conference.
Well, it's not me so much as.
Yeah. You know, Win, uh, when you, uh... when you told me this.
Mmm. No, 'cause we called his office, didn't we, Honey?
Yeah.
We're thinking about getting a dog so we wanted to call him and ask.
Yeah.
Mmm.
It's got to be something really freaky-deaky, hunh?
I mean.
But every community has its dark underbelly don't you think?
Here.
Caduceus.
Yeah, there's no sign of him in his house.
I didn't see him in the.
Mmm, maybe Win cleaning up.
I don't know.
Hey, what do we know about this stuff?
All right.
Why kill Big Mike?
Whoa!
Compulsive neatness, or a lack thereof.
Have you noticed how.
Well.
Come on, Laura, you know... we're married now.
The thrill is gone.
Bring it on.
Hey, Win.
Want to play horse?
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
Why?
What's going to happen if we don't?
It's just a basketball hoop, Win.
I don't.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
I get fined?].
Warned about what?
Stop!
Cami... you all right?
Scull...!
Tidying up.
Whoever it was, they put away my basketball hoop.
I got a look at that thing that's been scaring everybody and I take.
Here we go.
Yeah...I'm guessing there's one of these in every.
Always.
A landfill?
It does. Somehow, it's one and the same. The Klines?
What if they're still here.
Putting in a pool.
Ah... It's not a swimming pool.
Tasteful, isn't it?
Gogolak.
Hey, can you get an excavation team out here?
We need to dig deeper.
To price some rattan furniture.
Let's start with the Klines.
You're.
Yeah, whirligig.
It's tacky enough to break your rules and your.
But you didn't know exactly what you were getting into, did you?
I.
Scully?
Scully?
Scully?
Scully?
Scully, hang on. Mrs. Scully? There's a question of how he could've gotten to her in the first Agent Scully was carrying a small piece of metal that was removed Yes, but that still doesn't explain how he could have found I don't know. He talked about a mountain but he wasn't specific I'd like to brief them myself... Sir, I know Duane Barry. I've been in his head, I know how he Sir... Right there. Back it up a few frames. She's still alive. Print this up. Yeah. I didn't. Where was that patrolman killed again? Doesn't Route 229 lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway? Ascend to the stars. Skyland Mountain. Get your car and meet me downstairs. Just get your car. I'll deal with Skinner. Come on, let's go. I'm fine. No, I said I'm fine. Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening Look, I know you think we should have told Skinner but if he If we find him first, we'll notify the Bureau. All right? Well, that's the easiest explanation. It's also the most implausible. Somebody could have given him her address. I don't know who. Did he have a woman with him? You gotta get me up there. I don't have the time. No, you don't have a choice. Stay here and whatever happens, don't let him stop the tram. Go ahead. You're breaking up. What are you doing? Turn it back on. Krycek, what's happening Is there an emergency system on-board? Can you read me down Federal agent! Freeze! I said freeze! Where is she? Don't move. Where is she? Where'd you leave her? Who? Now what happened after you took her out of the trunk? Then where'd you take her?
Did you kill her? How'd you get this? What ship? I saw a helicopter. Sit down, Duane. Duane, settle down! Did you hurt her? Did you hurt her!? What is this? Yeah. No, he's giving me nothing. Were you out here alone? Nobody goes in or out of that room. What are you doing in there? Come here. No one... No one! No one is to interrogate the suspect. Except me. Did you ask him about Scully? What'd he say? Yes, sir. What happened? Duane? Duane? I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy of this man's autopsy report. Are you the pathologist? Can I ask what your preliminary findings are? You haven't run a toxicological yet? I'd be interested to see what you find. When will they be on I'd like a copy as soon as possible, please. What do you mean, military? You're not F.B.I.? I didn't kill him, if that's what you're suggesting. I was interrogating him about Agent Scully. He wasn't cooperating Momentarily. But then I left the room. He was very much alive, Is Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him too? There is another plausible cause of death. Poisoning by injection or ingestion. You won't find that on the navy pathologist's report. That the autopsy is incomplete. That the military covered up Because they know where Scully is. Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because I find it hard to trust Alex? Alex, can I borrow your car keys? There's someone I've got to see. I know, just give me the car keys please. What? Why? Do they have something on him? I need his help. Your predecessor could have helped me. I want an answer! You mean the government? So long as it's true. It goes on. Yes, sir. I found this in Agent Krycek's car. He doesn't smoke. Agent I don't know, the military? Some covert organization within Because Agent Scully got too close to whatever it is they're I don't know. How far do you think they'd go? That's it? He's gone, he just disappears into the woodwork? Who are these people who can just murder with impunity and we Like hell. What can you do about it? I'm sorry I don't have better news. We don't know anything more about her. It's probably scarier when you stop having the dream. Don't Don't you want to keep it? I brush after every meal. Would you say they match? Special Agent Sam Chaney. Chaney's a legend. During their time, Chaney's and Ledbetter's ideas weren't Exactly.
There's another mystery. Well, I'd like to know why this policewoman would suddenly.
Yes, and also I've always been intrigued by women Well, the initial police report states that you couldn't explain What were you doing in the woods at that hour? And you left your car...
Would you say that's uh... four or five hundred yards? So from that distance, you could see a dog digging in this Well, the report says she phoned in from the Motel Black No, no, not at all. I would just like to ask Detective Morrow a Have you ever, um, have you ever had any clairvoyant Yeah.
Well, the press called the murderer He would carve the word SISTER on their chests and paint The victims bled to death. The murderer was never found. Can you make out a word? I checked with the precinct mechanic. BJ's car was just.
What are you talking about? What do you mean? How do you know?
Aw... pshaw. Could he have carved out another word on his ribcage? Uh, we may have. It seems Agent Chaney might have been You all right? Um, I've approximated the pattern of the cuts to match up If we exhumed one of the Slash Killer's victims, we could do Excuse me? You're right. I think you're mistaken. Those were shot in 1942. I think we all feel that way at one time or another. Well, I've often felt that dreams are answers to questions What does he look like? Do you remember anything else? You think you could draw it? Could be the Trylon and the Perisphere. You can get pictures of these on postcards all over Times And the police never made the connection to the 1942 Well, I don't want to jump to any rash conclusions, George Foreman won the heavyweight crown at 45. Anyway, this still doesn't explain BJ's connection to all this. You mean consciously forgotten information? Yeah, but that still doesn't explain why she would go into a You mean a hunch? Well, that's a pretty extreme hunch.
I never have. Harry Cokely? I'm Special Agent Mulder, this is Special Agent Scully. Do you recognize this man? His name's Chaney. He was an FBI agent who was also murdered in Aubrey in Do you have a witness to testify to that? Can you tell us what happened, BJ? You're sure it was him. Like his mug shot? But that's the picture of a young man. It's open. Cokely's blood? But for some reason he let BJ live. I think it's time we paid a visit to Mrs. Thibedeaux.
No children? Mrs. Thibedeaux, our records show that you recuperated.
What happened to the child?
Something just doesn't track, Scully. No, maybe she did see a younger man... young Cokely. It would make sense, Scully. Genetic traits often skip a When I was a, a kid, I would have nightmares. I would My dad would be in the study eating these. Well, on a basic cellular level, we're the sum total of all our There are countless stories of twins separated at birth who Jung wrote about it when he talked about the collective That's BJ's father. She's responsible for the murders. Get your coat. Let's go. No, but Cokely is, and that's who BJ has become. Scully, this is what I think. I think that Cokely's memories, Yes. I can't explain everything. Maybe she carved them on herself, We have to warn Mrs. Thibedeaux. If BJ has, in the sense Mrs. Thibedeaux? Mrs. Thibedeaux! Where did she go?
This is Agent Mulder, I need an ambulance.
I don't think so, Scully. I think if She's probably figured out by now that Cokely's her.
Cokely? Cokely! Cokely? No, don't. BJ. Yes, you are. I'm looking for Detective Waltos? My name is Mulder. I work with Assistant Director Skinner. Why don't you just get a statement here?
Yeah. Yeah, it appears to be a little more complicated than that. I don't understand it either. They're not letting me talk to.
Excuse me, sir? Detective? Detective? Detective?
You don't believe him? What about the victim? Has she been identified? Well, there must be evidence of an intruder of some kind. Well, then, if you know the drill, then you should be Detective?
When you're done Get any of that? No, no, I want you to take a look at that body. Get down Beyond what? Were Skinner's the only prints lifted from the body? At least they were having safe sex. Yeah. Her name was Carina Sayles. She was a legal Yeah, I just got off the phone with one of the partners. Yeah, she was doing some moonlighting. She was taking This client operated an escort service. She was a I'll get the car.
Lorraine Kelleher? Busy or not, we need to speak with her. I think you mean banging. Oh, that's all right. I don't think she's gonna be making She's dead. She was murdered last night. That's what we're still trying to determine. I guess that would hurt future book sales, huh? No, I don't think I would be. Look, we just need one name from you. Who hired Carina.
Cut the crap. Who hired her? Then you have his name. Thank you. What the hell was he thinking? You'd think he'd be a little more discrete. Still, not enough to prove anything conclusively. You really believe Skinner did this? Credit card fraud happens every day. We know that he's put his ass on the line for us a number.
Yeah, Mulder. Thank you.
Detective Waltos. Skinner's been released on his own Sir? Sir? Of course it concerns us. Does it explain why you refused to take a polygraph test? Ask me what? No. I don't think he did it. Yeah. Well, I don't know what you do down in Norfolk, but last What do you mean? What case? He hasn't even been charged yet. For what? In case we might turn up any evidence that Skinner's not answering his phone. Yeah. Why? He knows better than that. The evidence is The man's marriage is breaking up. He's stressed out.
Please. Give him the benefit of the When I mentioned that hooker to him, he didn't even seem What do you mean? Either he remembers or he's a liar. Night terrors? It's fascinating, but what does it have to do with Skinner? For running away from trains? So you think that Skinner may have killed the victim in his And it's not such a strange story. It's ancient, actually. You may have heard it, although not Usually. Though sometimes the succubus becomes so Reports of residual luminous phenomena have been This phosphorescence required no UV or infrared light? Did you get a sample? And? What'd they say? Are you sure you saw something?
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's That he doesn't know he didn't do it. The C.T. scan showed a subdural hematoma. She's in You can't do that, sir. Not yet. But they're building a pretty convincing case. No, I don't, but I'm in the minority. Scully...
Scully doesn't understand What about the old woman in your dream. Who is she? Again? Yeah, you were the sole survivor. You also described That's when you first saw her? And why not?
So you just dismissed her as another But you couldn't? Well, maybe she was trying to protect you. That's a question only you can answer. This is Skinner's car? Woltos' people finish going over the interior? Can I borrow your flashlight? I'll meet you there. Collecting evidence. Your car hits something, a bag fills with air and you It doesn't look like a face. How long does that fine-tuning take? I'm not the only one who needs it.
Hello. Hello. What happened, where's Skinner? They dismissed him? And they used us to do it, didn't they? They used the Because I think Skinner's been out-maneuvered, Scully. To put us in check. You remove Skinner and you weaken us. This is the man that stole Skinner's car last night and tried Well, they already tried that once, and a second attempt I don't know. Danny couldn't find anything on him. Well, this guy's a pawn. Pawns always make the first move.
What happened here? He got to her first. Is this the man who hired Carina? He lied. Skinner's not the only person he set up. I need you to arrange a meeting. Unfortunately, Lorraine can't get to the phone right now. Look what he did to your friends. We're your only chance I want you to call him. Tell him you're scared because we No, he hasn't shown up yet. This guy isn't about to let a little rain stop him. Scully, what's going on? He's upstairs. You OK? Yeah, there's something else you'll find missing in there. Why not? Then why don't you tell me? Off the record. Look at that. Huh... Huh? Oh, shi... Don't.
What do you mean what am I going to tell him? Now, how is that different? I did not overreact. Ronnie Strickland was a vampire. You're my proof. You were there.
No, no, no, I didn't say that. I just want to hear it the way Prison, Scully. Your cell mate's nickname is going to be All right, start at the beginning. Hope you brought your cowboy boots. Yee-haw! Actually, a town called Chaney, about 50 miles How does that grab ya? Dead cow! Exactly. Specifically, a dead 900-pound Two small puncture wounds on the neck? Too bad. We got 'em. Check it out. Yeah, that's probably it, satanic cultists. El Chupacabra? No, they got four fangs, not two, Classic vampirism. And one dead human last night - a vacationer from New Lock the door on your way out. Yes. I'm... Agents Mulder and... Come on, Scully, get those little legs moving. Come on. Nice threads. Your satanic cultists have some sharp little teeth. Go ahead, tell him your, uh, What about the fang marks? Dana?!
He never even knew your first name. No. Go ahead.... Dana. Sheriff, you say this man is exactly as you found him? Have you noticed that this man's shoes are untied? This means something. Sheriff, do you have an old Take me there now.
Scully, we're going to need a complete autopsy on this I don't know. Come on, Sheriff Hartwell. The name of it was actually the Sam Houston Motor Lodge. What?
Nothing. Chloral hydrate? Nothing. Who slipped him the mickey? What kind of vampire would do that? We got another dead tourist. You got to do another autopsy. I won't let it go to waste. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. That's it? Who's the black private dick who's a sex machine with all I did not! That's what you're going to tell Skinner? You are afraid to tell the truth.
That's not the way it happened at all. I mean, what are You're damn right. Yesterday morning began like any I hope you brought your cowboy boots. Actually, it's a little town just south of there called Well, I brought some slides with which to better illustrate. It's actually six dead cows. And here's the really Um, well, because of the manner in which they died. And two little puncture marks right here on the neck. Uh... well, on the corpses drained of blood and the fang Well, why not? Well... that's... one opinion, and I respect that. Why would a town with a population of only 361 need that? He had a slight overbite. I'm just trying to be thorough. So, anyway, then we went.
No exam has been done? That depends on what you think it looks like, Sheriff Still, that leaves us in something of a quandary because To the Serbs, a prime indicator of vampirism is red hair. My point is that we don't know exactly what we're looking I'm getting to it. Historically, cemeteries were thought to be a haven for Yeah. So, we're out here looking for any signs of Broken or shifted tombstones. A faint groaning coming from under the earth. The sound Manducation. Now, Sheriff, I know my methods may seem a little odd It's just that my gut instinct tells me that the killer will Maybe after nightfall, Sheriff, but he'll come. Hmm? I'm getting to it. Sunflower seed?
Sorry. Historically, certain types of seeds were thought to Well, oddly enough, there seems to be one obscure fact Well, he didn't actually pick them up. He counted them. Well, if he had picked them up he would have been a Well, that would be illegal, right? Yeah. Help! Right down to the shoes.
She ordered a pizza from you? Excellent. How much? Let me get my wallet. Okay, there's $13. Ah, Scully. Square in the chest. No effect. Well, I don't think I'll use the phrase flying squirrel Well, they'll have to, once they examine Ronnie Strickland's Would you stop that? Stop it.
I was drugged! The coroner's dead? I noticed that. I noticed that, too. Because tradition states that a vampire needs to sleep in Yeah. Fangs are very rarely mentioned in the folklore. Real What about his family... the ones who are going to sue No home address?
That's the sheriff. Yeah, actually you can. You can stay behind here with Where might you be living if your mail came general You're good. Hello? Scully, what happened? They pulled up stakes. And I can neither confirm nor deny agent Scully's version That is... essentially, exactly the way it happened. I didn't think you'd be in today. How are you, Dana? Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University. No arrests were ever made. Police believed it to be a one-time Well, here's another grim deadline. He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping. He Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids then his He claims to have obtained this information through psychic Perhaps. At the age of six, Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal Actually, he's requested to speak to me. He read my profile on him and he believes I'm the only one who I think you should take some time. I'm sorry about your father. We? You mean the souls of your victims? And you're the conduit? From here? Where exactly are you? That's exactly what the state of North Carolina intends to do First you've got to prove you're telling the truth. I tore this off my New York Knicks t-shirt. It has nothing to Scully, what's wrong? Did Boggs say something to you? It's alright. Why don't you go back to the motel? We've exposed It's Mulder. No, no, just five hours of Boggs' channeling. After three hours, Then how did you find it? Scully, I told you about Boggs... That doesn't matter! That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could What you're really saying is that you didn't want to go on record Why now? After all we've seen, why Boggs? You love your father. Scully, look at this. That's exactly what I want Boggs to think. They haven't been found, the article is bogus. The Carolinian Turn off that phone. Turn it off. Mulder. Agent Scully believes what we all believe. That you have the Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead. What's the name? Describe him. Where is he? Did you get that? Federal agent! No matter what, don't believe him. Boggs created this whole Don't... deal with him. He could be trying to claim you as his Scully. Dana. After all you've seen, after all the evidence, why can't You couldn't face that fear? Even if it meant never knowing How?
Both men espouse a fringe theory called Panspermia..
It's the.
Dr. Sandoz, the man he'd come to meet made a similar claim in a....
Well, we'd have to ask Dr. Sandoz that.
We can't. He's missing.
Skinner wants us on the case.
I am just a hired gun for the FBI.
What if there's something to this?
That's what we're being asked to figure out.
No.
No... I couldn't hear it.
My sister.
Fox Mulder with the FBI.
Any ideas yourself about what happened here?
About the missing Dr. Sandoz?
I don't know.
It's, uh... a hollow noise.
The same thing that.
No.
This is going to sound weird but I think it's that thing.
I'm sorry.
I thought this was my office.
You don't believe it, Chuck?
Noise.
Aural dissonance.
It comes and it goes.
No, but it was a few minutes ago.
Why?
Suspicious of what?
Yeah. It has to do with the occult.
That's what this thing is?
How do you know that?
Does he back any of that up?
Yeah, but wouldn't it be in his great interest to hide something.
In 1996, a rock from Mars was found in Antarctica.
How did it get.
Hmm.
No, no, it's going away.
No, I'm okay. I really am.
I'm not going home to bed, Scully.
I think I know what's causing.
Yes.
This man Solomon Merkmallen is dead.
Barnes knows it.
He.
No, I'm not... not until after I show you what he did with the.
We'll let you know if we find it.
Whatever happened to Dr. Sandoz, he certainly liked to fly south.
That's Albert Hosteen.
Maybe he was using him to read the symbols on the artifact.
Scully, you packing any latex?
Doesn't it smell like somebody forgot to take out the garbage?
He's afraid for his life because of what he knows and what he has...
A genuine artifact... one of several pieces of an unknown whole.
... was to incriminate Sandoz, to make him look like the killer.
All of which would retain telltale traces of radiation.
The artifact.
Cosmic Galactic Radiation.
It's a kind of radiation that's found.
Oh, forget the arrest.
We got to find these artifacts.
Is there someone else on this case, sir?
There's someone else on this case... you're not.
I hear it... in my head.
No, I'm not.
Listen to me... he's not telling the truth.
I'm.
I need to find those artifacts.
Hello?
I'm here. I'm resting.
I'm home.
It's okay. Where are you?
Does he have the artifact?
What?
Scully, that artifact is extraterrestrial.
Did you know what that would mean?
No, it would mean that our progenitors were alien.
You're wrong.
It holds everything.
Don't you see?
Well, then, you go ahead and prove me wrong, Scully. Was this damaged during the incident? May I see the suspect? A forty-two year old real estate agent murders four strangers In each incident, the suspect was killed? Were autopsies conducted on the suspects for substance abuse? What's wrong with right field? Got to have an arm to play right field. I played right field. Perpetrators of mass murders are divided into two classifications... I find no evidence of this to be the case. Uh, pardon my rubber. They are connected. Mrs. McRoberts? This is Sheriff Spencer, and I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the Federal You can blame me. May I speak with him? It's the day's most important meal. Um... this invoice? It was, uh, signed by you. Did you pick Can you describe to me exactly how the dashboard read-out was Why? No! Imagine being one of those flies on the wall of the Oval Office. It was a fine effort, though. Oh, I'm sorry, boys. It arrived the same day as my subscription She wouldn't come. She's afraid of her love for you. You know, Frohike, it's men like you that give perversion a Why won't they release it? Is it possible it affects humans Hey, Frohike, can I borrow those? I saw the chopper from two different locations. Look at my skin, Don't start with that tired crap. Don't start diverting blame. Look, if you're the one responsible for the illegal spraying, Yeah, well, if it's so safe, why was it done in secret? By who? Who proved it to you? Scully, your own autopsy reported the killer had chemical anomalies. Scully. Are you familiar with subliminal messages? No, it's a fact that some department stores use subliminal messages Electronic devices were destroyed by every perpetrator. The insecticide L.S.D.M. is known to invoke a fear response Yeah, he's probably one of those people that thinks Elvis is I think this area is being subjected to a controlled experiment. They've done it before. D.D.T. in the 50's, Agent Orange, germ Fear. It's the oldest tool of power. If you're distracted by But? Only seven more to go. Frustrated Jehovah's witness? Edward Funsch, age fifty-two. No diploma, no vehicle or driver's When was the blood tester here? Ten-thirty? Here it comes. Have you seen this man? Where'd you let him out? I don't think he's waiting. Scully, anything? Get down! Put it down! Then put it down, Ed. I know they won't, Ed. I know they won't let you. If you don't put it down, I'm going to have to shoot you. Or It's all right. I want unrestricted access to him for questioning. How'd you hear about us? So you didn't get a description of who the kid saw? Plus jumpers tend to open the window before they jump. Like that?
Was his hair dark like mine or Michelle? Was his mustache like that?
Mrs. Bishop?
This is the man Michelle says She also mentioned a friend... someone named Sheila. Look at that? Looks like a hawk or a falcon. Japanese paper folding. Where'd she learn how to do that? So Harry, you'll put that face into the system? Can you give Scully a ride back into the city? That's your department. I'm gonna go over to Brylin Oh, oh, and check for burns or lesions on Barbala's body. Psychokinesis is usually associated with an electrical How else could a 60-pound kid throw a 200-pound Could Michelle have fabricated him? As in schizophrenia? And in Michelle's case? Any theories? Have you tried deep regression hypnosis? OK. Well, in the meantime, how have you been treating I'm sure. Have you observed any unexplained phenomena Inordinate physical strength, psychic ability, Hey, you're the one that found a lesion on Barbala's body. Why is it still so hard for you to believe, even when all the What? You have the police report describing Morris' death? Does it describe how he was murdered? Give me the grisly details. This is what Michelle did to a dozen dolls in her shrink's Detective Fiore? We're with the FBI. Can we talk to you You two were partners? What can you tell us about the circumstances surrounding Well, we believe that the death of Detective Rudy Barbala Well, that's what we need your help with. For what? The Triads. So you think that Charlie Morris was killed as a warning to Is it me or did we just get the brush-off? What? A patrol unit picked her up a few blocks away from the bus Mrs. Bishop, no one is accusing Michelle of anything. I'm sorry, excuse me. Three of whom are now dead. And a little girl from Orchard Park. Morris, Fiore, Barbala and Felder. What's wrong with Right. Why would he say that? What? Is there a log sheet? May we come in? Scully. Look familiar? Someone you might have had dinner with once, a friend Mrs. Fiore, I couldn't help noticing your origami collection. Charlie? Michelle is eight years old, that means that she was Metempsychosis, transmigration, reembodiment, Well, what about the composite drawing and the dolls It's not so far-fetched, Scully. Reincarnation is a basic Well, individuals with strong past-life memories often One short step away from proving the pre-existence of Dr. Spitz has conducted hundreds of these sessions and... Is it any more dangerous than pumping her full of thorazine? We almost had it, Scully. We were right there. We'll have to try it again. Well, we have to change her mind. The truth. What really happened to Charlie Morris If we find Fiore. And if he's still alive. Scully, you All evidence suggests that Michelle Bishop IS Charlie Short of her growing a moustache, how much more.
The inconclusive results of Michelle's past There was a documented case in the early seventies of So you're saying he was drowned first and then mutilated Except for what? You said salt water, right? So Charlie Morris was drowned in his own tropical fish tank.
Go check out upstairs. Michelle! This won't make right what happened.
Closing entry, file number X-40271.
Rough night?
What can you tell us about him?
Can't blow the whistle with a mouth like that.
Well, if it was acid in the face he would have screamed bloody murder.
Huh.
There's no ashtrays.
Dr. Scobie and his wife don't smoke?
A tobacco employee that doesn't smoke....
Isn't that kind of like a GM.
You mind if I tag along?
Really? No hard feelings that he was about to turn federal witness against.
I'm sure she'll take comfort in finding out why her husband died.
Dr. Voss...
can you tell me what that is?
We found it at Jim Scobie's house.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Answering that question would violate.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
What?
Well, not necessarily.
There weren't any signs of struggle in the room.
Well, that this isn't a homicide.
You... examined the body Scully.
Did.
Well, it's a, tobacco beetle, yeah.
I don't know but judging from Dr. Voss's reaction to this I think it's the.
Guests check in, but they don't check out.
Probably nothing.
That Jim Scobie wasn't murdered.
Neither was this man.
These.
But there was an open window through which they could have escaped.
FBI.
Sorry to wake you.
Thank you.
We're investigating the death of a man who lived right next to.
He yelled?
No.
You don't seem surprised that he's dead.
What is your name, sir?
Mr. Weaver, did you see or hear anything unusual last night?
Other than that?
The FBI would appreciate your voluntary cooperation, sir.
That's the way it.
That's my card.
Thank you, Mr. Weaver.
Anything?
Good. Talk to her.
See about something else that's been bugging me.
Mrs. Voss?
Fox Mulder.
Is your husband home?
I understand your reluctance to talk, sir.
You have a nice family... a lot to.
There's been another victim... Thomas Gastall.
Died exactly the same way.
Well, we found these all over him.
I believe that that's what killed both.
I... I understand that, but... maybe these don't.
No.
But why are you hiding behind your lawyers, doctor?
How many.
Talking to lawyers over at Justice.
Trying to get a look at Morley's files.
Mmm.
It must be bad.
Like a dust buster attacked me.
Mr. E pluribus....
Beats the alternative.
What about Darrel Weaver?
It was the nicotine itself that was keeping him alive?
It's good for killing tobacco beetles.
That's not all it did.
I bought these on the way to work.
Well, they say the addiction is stronger than heroin.
I'll be right up.
No. She'll come.
Matter of time.
Ah...
Six prostitutes were seen with her at Dirty Dames never.
She's on tape going in.
The exits are covered.
She's nowhere.
That's the job, Scully... vigilance in the face of privation...
Mulder.
... Now?
... All right.
I got to go.
You wanted to see me, sir?
I'm already on a case.
Why? What did I do?
Specifically?
Well, the, uh... th-the raven is considered a very powerful.
No, really, what did I do?
I'm also assuming that the fact that Martha Crittendon's father.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Sure. Uh, I don't know how much help I'm going to be.
I know.
Great, thanks.
So, tell me about Martha Crittendon.
So, what's your theory on what happened?
Her husband was out of town when she disappeared?
What do you know about a raven?
Not necessary.
You're sure, uh, Martha's last name isn't Stewart?
How many talons would you say a raven had?
Never mind.
You know what this is?
You know what was hanging here?
You had no other signs of struggle?
Sir.
I hope we can help.
Uh, birth control pills.
Do you have any idea who your wife may have been seeing?
I wouldn't rule it out, but I doubt it.
According to your Audubon book here a raven has four talons.
No, no. Not... not a raven itself.
But, in folklore.
Well, there was also a broken mirror in Martha's house.
Hi.
No, no, that...
that's not necessary.
You know, I should really get the Bureau to reimburse you for.
Really?
Uh... Excuse me.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Mulder.
Oh, hey, Scully.
How's the stakeout?
Ouch.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, she'll come, you know?
It's just a matter of.
Hey, Scully, tough it out.
Whatever doesn't kill.
No, no, no, no.
No capers, thank you.
I said, What a... what a crazy caper..
Cheers.
What do you make of these claw marks?
I was going to say.
You okay?
I agree.
I do.
You said the car window shattered after you saw the reflection.
Mirrors are considered doorways.
In the Victorian Era, they.
Well, you asked about the raven, right?
The raven is a carrion.
We understand there was no love lost between you and Martha.
Well, let's stay on the subject of you.
On your police record.
Where were you the night she disappeared?
Fair enough, but why did she lie about her alibi?
I got that vibe.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Mulder.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
Well, the view may not be too different here.
You know, Scully, this case has turned out to.
Well, there's a murder victim that I'd like you to.
What? What did you say?
Are you feeling a little better, Ellen?
Can you...
just talk to.
It came back... the... the creature you saw?
I believe she saw something.
What about the two broken mirrors?
That's number six.
It's a match to the one Howard Crittendon.
Ellen, do you recognize this key?
You found it before you were attacked?
Oh, hey... good morning.
Good morning, Ellen.
Wow...
Uh, have you seen my shirt?
I left it...
Oh.
Oh, Ellen, you-you didn't have to go to the trouble of...
Well, maybe I should try that sometime.
Thanks.
Yikes.
Wow...
Well, Phil is living large.
Where is he this morning?
Whoa.
Uh-uh. That's fine.
Well, that has a vaguely pathetic ring to it.
Oh.
Um, not in the widely understood definition of that term.
Good morning.
Eh, I only woke up once, when you went out.
All night?
Well, I spoke to the coroner this morning and the autopsy shows.
You have a piece of evidence in your possession that I'd like.
You want to tell me what this unlocks?
Once I find out, we'll talk again.
Sheriff, you know that talk I said we should have?
So you were having an affair with both Jenny and Martha.
They knew about each other?
But I'm assuming.
Well, I think you got bigger problems facing you right now.
I said it was an entity summoned by somebody else....
Ellen?
Ellen?
Mulder.
You're free?
Oh, you solved the X-File.
What are you saying?
You didn't catch our blond.
What are you talking about?
.... our noses.
Well, good work, Scully.
I'll call you back later.
Ellen?
Ellen, it's Agent Mulder.
Ellen, Jenny Uphouse is dead.
Your husband is in custody.
Ellen, you went out this morning after breakfast.
Where'd you go?
I think it is.
Ellen, I think you have a whole other side that.
Ellen, you need to open this door.
You want to see her?
I think it's about as close as science can come. I think the.
She wanted so much from her life with you... a perfect life....
Hey, Scully, it's me.
Right, right. I know. But.
You didn't rent a convertible, did you?
Are you aware of the statistics of decapitation?
You shouldn't talk and drive at the same.
Mulder.
I thought you said you were on vacation.
I thought you said you didn't want to.
It's the World's Deadliest Swarms.
A handle on what?
Towards who?
Themselves?
Dead? How?
Huh... it sounds to me like.
Maybe you don't know what.
Scully....
Marry me.
Well, you know, short of.
Hey, morning, sunshine.
Yeah. I was.
I left you a message.
Yeah?
I'm at home. They're.
Yeah, a medical cause.
Yeah, St. Vitus's dance.
It affect groups of people.
Oh.
Yeah?
Hello?
Hey. I thought you.
I, uh, I had a new thought.
What types of objects?
You mean like Chuckie?
Yeah, the talking doll myth.
You didn't find a talking.
I would suggest that you.
That would be my first.... Oh, hey, Scully. How you doing? What? Oh, I got it down on M Street at some head shop Why? You do? Who? Who? Yeah. Hey, does this have something to do with that Did you solve it? Oh, God. It's amazing what I can accomplish without.
There's... got Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
They said the birds refused to sing and the.
In the endless procession of souls... in what cannot.
He's got hours of video of her.
Yeah.
You don't know how badly I wanted her to be in one of.
Mr. Piller?
How can we help you?
Did he?
What happened?
What happened to them?
What is it?
We still have a missing body... Amber Lynn LaPierre... she may.
It's not the first time I've heard what he's saying.
About the.
Or maybe they are somewhere else.
I do.... I do.
How long have you been doing this?
These walk-ins... you say they come and take the children.
Why?
How do you know that?
You see them.
Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?
How's that?
What is the connection?
What? What are you doing?
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Yeah, the TV is on.
What?
Shoot.
What does she say?
What is she saying?
Harold?
Come on, Harold.
That's crap.
You're full of crap.
Get out of here.
No, I'm telling you. I never should have listened to you.
Please go.
Who wrote that?
Mulder.
What is it?
In 1973.
I know all about that.
I don't see where you're going with this, Scully.
Well, that's not exactly a revelation, Scully.
I don't see what you think this proves or how you.
It's a dead end.
He's never been of any help and.
Not exactly the end of the rainbow, is it, Harold?
I've had a look.
There's nothing here.
It's a decommissioned base.
Why do you care so much about what I feel?
Why is it so.
My sister was here?
In one of these houses?
Where?
Which house, Harold?
Come on, which house?
Harold, we don't have all night.
Come on, which house was it?
Let's go, Harold.
You were right.
This was the house.
Look.
You told me she was here.
You didn't say with who.
Well, it turns out you were right, Scully.
He had every reason to.
Scully, I saw her name in the cement.
Her handprints, right.
You went to him?
Oh, well... he's a liar.
The handprints prove he's a liar!
I saw her handprints.
Sit down, Harold.
Agent Scully has informed me that you failed to mention.
That you're currently the subject of a criminal investigation into.
You only tell me what you see.
Maybe afterwards we can play.
It's here.
There was a boy - he led me into this room.
They did more tests today, but not the horrible kind.
This is 1979.
She's 14 years old here.
14 years old.
Sometimes I think my memories were taken by the.
And then, uh... she's, uh... talking about running away.
She.
You know, I never stop to think... that the light is billions of.
All right.
What are you talking about?
When did you find this?
She didn't give a name at all.
Read this.
It's the medical.
Evidence of probable self-inflicted abuse.
Including.
And he knew.
He lied.
He knew she was alive and the only.
I know. I know.
You don't want me to get my hopes up.
We have an E.R. nurse who signed her in.
I have this... powerful feeling and I can't explain it, but that...
Samantha.
End of the road.
He's okay.
It's okay.
He's dead.
They're all dead, Harold.
Your son, Amber Lynn.
Harold, you see so much but you refuse to see him.
You refuse.
I'm fine.
I'm free. I'm Agent Mulder. Satanists take the eyeballs and leave the body, not vice-versa. Anthropomancy. It was once believed that you could divine your And an amateur tasseographer. She read tea leaves. I'm not convinced of its accuracy but I'm pretty sure the victim Her leaves were telling her she was about to be murdered. I'm part of this investigation. I can assure you, Mister Yappi, I'm a believer in psychic ability. Mister Yappi, read this thought. Well, let me impress you with my psychic ability. Mister Yappi Well, his leads are so vague as to be practically useless yet Yeah, and some are bound by percentages to be right but most Oooh, I just got a chill down my spine. How had the eyes been cut out? We did find some crystal shards on the body, how do you know Mister Bruckman? Sorry, Mister Bruckman, but I'm going to have Step inside, Mister Bruckman. A murder occurred here earlier this evening and we have reason You're not under suspicion... but I do harbor a suspicion that I think you do. Pinch me. No, something told me, Scully, something is telling me this Can you describe him? Do you get a visual impression of him? What is it? What do you see? Then what's wrong? Mister Bruckman, can you tell us why the killer is murdering Be honest, Scully. Doesn't that propane tank bear more than Did you answer my question? He named the specific body of water the victim would be found I don't believe he's the killer. Well, if he's not, then how did he know where the body would Everything you said is correct. But you do admit to having this gift. Mister Bruckman, you possess an ability that not only has staggering Y, yes, I would. Mister Bruckman, this murderer has already committed four homicides. How can you be so sure? Then if the future is written, then why bother to do anything? Mister Bruckman, I believe in your ability but not your attitude. That's a hit. In psychical research parlance, a correct answer's I have no way of verifying that information. Do you receive any other impressions from it? I'm now convinced of our psychic's abilities, Scully, or rather, Miss. Save me the headache, Scully, what is it? Is that a hit or a miss? You got all that information just by handling that keychain? How are you receiving this information about the body's location? I mean, are you seeing it in a vision or is it a... sensation? But how do you know? Why are you telling me that? Do you remember the first time you foresaw someone's death? What happened in 1959? I'm not following. I'm still not following. Yeah, Mister Bruckman, I don't understand how you can know that Okay, now. The only evidence recovered from Claude Dukenfield's body. That But it'll take them time to provide any information. A similar Mister Bruckman... I can't speak for my partner but I'm desperate... Is he? Like what? What does he see? Where does this take place? Well, why don't I see him, what am I doing? What? Whatever, please continue. All right, I'm looking down at this banana cream pie and then And? And, what does he see? You got all that from this? To whom it may concern. Like our lives, this is a mere formality No, no, this letter is postmarked the day before Mister Bruckman Get this, Scully. The lab analysis from the first bit of fiber You know what I like. But what are the odds of the Big Bopper, Chantilly lace... If coincidences are just coincidences, why do they feel so contrived? Am I keeping you awake? Well, I've had dreams in my life where I had a vision and then No, no, I'm not a Freudian, no. Oh, yeah. I just didn't sleep well. What's up? I'm beginning to lose patience with our psychic, Scully. What So, you're convinced he's a psychic now? Now, we've either got a copycat killer or our guy's getting If my Miss Manners serves me right, that protrusion from his Ah, we've got more than that this time, Scully. We've got fingerprints, Woman's intuition. Hey! How'd you know where to find us? Thank heaven for happenstance. Then Bruckman is all right? Well, then where is he? Miss Scully. I have lived with a fragile faith built on the ether of vague What happened to me out on the ice has justified every belief. I have been looking for you. You got to wonder about a country where even the President has I found these in my email this morning... three obituaries. Nobody I know but obviously somebody who knows me. The deceased are Doctor Landon Prince of Scranton, Pennsylvania... Sounds like it. It's taken me all morning to figure that out. This is the latest victim, Doctor Landon Prince. And these are Nope. I can't find any blood connection between them. In fact, You don't know anything else about him? As soon as you locate Doctor Prince's remains. Well, there have been two identical fire deaths. Neither body Is that what you think, Reverend? Well, it's my opinion that whoever killed Doctor Prince will Have you been to New York or New Jersey in the past two weeks? This clipping, where'd you get it? Which newspaper? Do you have a record of his name or address? Thank you. What do you mean? Sounds just like an X-File. If somebody really wanted to set us up, would they give us this Unless we get to them first. The deaths follow a pattern... How, how would you access that? That's north. Yeah, this is Agent Mulder. I need to enlist your help. I'm heading your way with Agent Scully. We have reason to believe Yes, Agent Weiss? Did you find Doctor Baker? Uh, we may already be too late but we should take a look around Sorry I'm late, I just flew in. Syracuse. Agent Scully and I were following up a lead on a case. No, sir. No, sir. I'd assumed we had an understanding with respect to What? It's impossible... I spoke to Agent Weiss, I saw him at the Sir... Mulder. Where are you? Agent Weiss is dead, Scully. Somebody killed him and Skinner hit the roof. We're being grounded No, why? What is it? Yeah? Stay where you are, Scully, I'll be right there to pick you What case is that? How did they get here? For what purpose? What's your business in this? What makes you think we've been contacted? We know where one of these man may be. Doctor Dickens? I believe you've been trying to contact us. It's okay, sir, there's nothing to be afraid of! He's moving... he's getting up! Okay. I just got the wind knocked out of me. Don't lose him! Like I should've used the crosswalk. A lot better than my phone. Scully, if what our friend from the C.I.A. says is true, this Oh, I changed it to trust everyone. I didn't tell you? I think you're being overly paranoid about him, Scully. Is that what you want me to put on my report to Skinner? Because Three identical men are dead. A fourth identical man is alive Those are the risks we take. You either accept them or you don't. Why don't you send it to our lab guys for analysis? In putting together my report for Skinner, I came across something Strange how? How excessive? Due to what? Didn't Agent Chapel say something about these doctors being Yeah? All right, I'll be right there. Just the truth. I got hit by a car. I'm sorry this is so late. I had trouble with the, uh, data Thank you. Mom? Yeah, I, I didn't expect you to answer. Wha, what are you doing Dad? Can you tell me what this is about? Check it out, I'll call you as soon as I can. Home. You said it was an emergency. What is it, Dad? Who is Mom talking to? You're exhausted. We all are. It's after 5.
Try and get some sleep. Yeah, Mom? I... I don't see who else it could be. It's twenty-two years too late. So much has happened. Where do you begin? Who were they? But you came to remember... us. What do you mean? Your f... your father. Hey, Scully, it's Mulder, pick up the phone. Okay, if you're Disguise himself how? As anyone? You got to be kidding. Yeah, I need to speak to Dana Scully, please. All right, I need her to call Fox Mulder as soon as she checks Yes. Scully, it's me.
Scully, it's me, where are you? Ok Scully, so we disagree, it's not the first time and This is the essence of science, you ask an impertinent Because, the lizard baby, wasn't born anywhere near Lake Bogee. If you know anything about trout fishing, or UFO hotspots. Four sightings in 1967, August, including one by a national Try a girl scout with an instamatic. Four of the It's the same Darlene Morris.

Hey buddy! Mind if I sit down? Wanna tell me about `em? Alright.
The TV? I don't know what it is, maybe a binary sequence of some You assume she ran away. Well, how do you explain what her mother saw? So basically you ignored her statement. But you didn't bother to check it out. Before what? Who me? I'm Mr. Congeniality. I'll send him a bundt cake. Like the night she disappeared? Who's Greg? What kind of stuff? `scuse me. Do you know where we could find Greg Randall? Actually, we were hoping you could tell us. Any ideas where he might have gone? Hey, that's a nice tattoo, what is that? Flying saucer. You don't really believe in that No, I think it's all just a bunch of crazy people howling No I haven't, why? Well, if you explain to me what you're talking about, Tell me what it is. It's your call Holtzman. So unless they tell me You're kidding. Well sure, I'll let you know as soon as I find out. Great. You shouldn't have told them. They have no jurisdiction.

Mrs. Morris, please give me a minute to explain. But your son, has seen something. The boy's the key Scully, I know it. Finding Ruby. Just think about it for a minute, No. I think that Kevin is a conduit, of some kind. A link, or a connection, to whoever, or whatever, took If there was an abduction, it's likely that Kevin was That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee. According to the police photos, Ruby and Kevin were sleeping Meaning what? Have you noticed the tree line? That's true. It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it. What if it's her? I need to know. Fine. Before you put that away, can I take a look at it? Sure you were Tessa.
You sat there and you waited and when they showed, you You snuck up from behind him and you shot him in the back, Where's she buried Tessa? You don't know where you buried her Tessa. You didn't? Well how would you know that Tessa, if you weren't there Which is? Is that your conclusion or the conclusion of the Sioux They're wasting their time. Why not, what if Ruby never did show up that night? Because something was out there in those woods. I can't do that. To talk to the boy. Well, I've gotta see him. Come with me or don't come with me but until they find Hello? I don't know. What is it? You know when I was a kid, I had this ritual. I Are you ok? Where's Kevin? KEVIN!

I can't move, so I don't...No, but I can hear her. She's calling out my name, over and over again. I know I should be but I'm not. Because of the voice. The voice in my head. Not to be afraid. It's telling me no harm will come I want to believe. Probably?
Lightning.
Why? You were doing just fine. I just don't think it's lightning. I don't know yet.
None of the evidence so far indicates So Teller's explanation works for you? Well, then this local lightening is a lot more predictable Well, look at the files, look at all the other victims, they're Looks like he was trying to get away in a big hurry. What time was Jack Hammond's last pizza delivery? All these stores would have been closed by 11.
Look, Scully, take a look at this. What were the names of the other victims?
Darren Oswald. What's his middle name?
DPO. Darren Peter Oswald. Well, he was here last night. They say he was struck by lightning. Right outside the video arcade. Not a cloud in the sky You must have seen something. Can I ask you a personal question? Do you consider yourself a lucky person? Yeah. I'm just thinking about all the people that got hit by Yeah? I don't know.
Thanks for your help. Lightning. The Schuman Resonance. Eight cycles per second.
Oh, that's certainly the way it looks. Looks like a fulgurite. That only happens with lightning That we're wasting our time chasing lightning? I don't know yet. That's great. Now can you make me a little cherub.
8½? That's pretty impressive.
Oooo.
What is it? Darren Oswald. I don't know, Scully, but lets go see if the shoe fits. Can we have a few minutes, Mrs. Oswald? Yeah?
Eight ½?

My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI. Yes. I'd like to ask you about Darren Oswald. He was at the Why? How did he explain this? I've been going over Oswald's chart. There's something Yeah. What is that? Electrolytes, right? And what do electrolytes do? Okay, it's a leap, Scully, but what if Oswald's electrolyte Unless his body is abnormally conductive. Because if No, I'm saying that he is lightning and we've got to Darren. Darren! Darren....
Relax, Darren. What did he say? How did he say he revived Kiveat?
I don't think he just resuscitated Did you see what he did to my phone? I think we should run a full set of lab tests on this kid, I can think of only one other person that might be able Mrs. Kiveat. Darren Oswald's in custody, Mrs. Kiveat. We arrested When did you first suspect that Darren was involved He actually confessed to killing those people? When was this? Jack Hammond? Did you tell anyone? Where's Oswald? You released him? When? I'll go call Sharon Kiveat.
Mrs. Kiveat's not home.
Excuse me, miss? Darren Oswald. He was released from custody. I'll stay with him. Go with Agent Scully. He's here.
Stay with them. I'm going after Oswald.
Teller, get out of there!
Lightning? What about the scientists at What about the tests I asked for? And?.. Darren Oswald is a perfectly normal, perfectly healthy Take a good look, Scully. Thirty loggers working a clear-cutting contract in Washington Anything strange, unexplainable, unlikely... boyfriend? You give up? Funny, that's apparently what the Federal Forest In a word, they vanished. Or so it would appear. Right. Two weeks ago, the group of loggers I just showed you No. The lumber company that employs the men has asked the Federal That's what the lumber company and the Federal Forest Service In 1934, long before anyone even knew what an ecoterrorist was, Not likely. That's a lot of flannel to be choking down even Hi. Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully, we're with the F.B.I. What's that in your windshield there? Is that a bullet hole? Somebody took a shot at you? Is that who you think took a shot at you? Mulder, Scully. So why do the ecoterrorists target you? You got a spare, don't you? Someone forgot to clean their plate. Party favors. What's that? Look at that. Made by what? You alright, Scully? Barely. Itsy-bitsy spider. What are you doing? Let's just hear what he has to say. Hey, it's alright. Happen to who? What happened here? Why not just hike out? What are you guys doing out here? Just, just hold off a second, okay? I think I'm going to suggest that we sleep with the lights on. This tree must be hundreds of years old. Hey, look at this. I don't think he did it. Well, he's not going anywhere! Maybe the wood in this ring is different. They're feeding on Could they have been living in that tree for hundreds of years? What do you know about insects, Scully? And they've been around a long time, right? And this tree is what, 5, 6, 700 years old? And these rings represent a history of climatic changes, which A volcanic eruption. This whole chain of mountains running from When Mt. St. Helens erupted, there was a large amount of radiation Well, then maybe what we're dealing with isn't a mutation at Yeah, maybe. Doing a little auto repair. Looks to me like you're planning So why are you sneaking around? He's got no reason to. Neither do I. Radio is back up. I'm not getting any reception so the receiver could be trashed. We could try. Well, turn it back on, I got the radio working. Spinney took it. He left earlier this morning. He took a battery and some gas. He gave me his word, yeah. Well, what would you have done? At least now we've got one chance There is no more gas, the other tanks have all been ruptured Look, it's done. I shouldn't have let him go. Let's just move I don't know. We'll think of something. We only found one cocoon. Look, Scully, what would you have done? Oh, will you cut the sanctimonious crap? You're right. And we're wasting time arguing about it. Button this place up. If we're gonna spend the night in here, It's alright, Scully, Scully... Stop moving! Stop! Stand still! Stand still! They're not just on you. They're everywhere. I think that's We are. I think the light keeps them from swarming. We'll be We got an hour and a half till sunrise. Maybe somebody heard our radio transmission. Help could be on Well, I'm not going to give up on Spinney. He gave me his word We'll think of something. Maybe we can patch this or at least get it to hold some air. Yeah. No, it's a jeep! What happened to your friends? Get out of there! Get back in the car! Better. How did the tests come back? Which is what? Scully? I told her it was going to be a nice trip to the forest. And if they're not?
Who are you?
Only what I see in your face.

The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully. There were other rumours too. I've been tracking this So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a Let's just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, What? Who are you? How do you know about my work? Who are you? Who do you work for? I can't do that. Yeah, I'm fine. Hello. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Er, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line. Mrs. Budahas? We're from the FBI. What kinds of things? Did he ever talk about his work? Eeh, you said word gets around, I'm sorry, erm, have you ever Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block? Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals, they're test pilots. Yeah, that's the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas I've been on hold with the base director of communications for Yeah, right.
Colonel Kissel? Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI. Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas? We're just looking around. We're not at liberty to comment. Paul? Right? You've lived in this area a while, But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you referred Who's the photographer? You're kidding, where? Put it on my tab. What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing I know. Let's go. We got our own map, sucker. I don't know, maybe nothing. Scully, wake up. You've gotta see this. I don't know, just keep watching it's unbelievable. They've been going at it like that for almost half an What else could they be? Here comes another one. Hey. Stay right there. Come on. Let's go, you're coming with us. Were you ever chased out before? What do you think they are? Do they look anything like this? Later Dude! Evidence. Why wouldn't I? Ho-hoo.

What's wrong? It's ok, it's ok, just relax, well, I'm Special Agent Mulder, Here, on base? Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate? And the names of your kids? Green Bay fan. Bet you remember the Superbowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler. Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you're a, a pilot, isn't that Bet you've flown just about everything with two wings. I think they re-wired that man's brain. Some kind Then you explain it to me. This is not amnesia, I think it's something far more deliberate And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we To control information. I think that after his psychotic No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically Hold on. You think if maybe we ignore him, he'll go away? Guess not.
Special You wanna tell me what this is about. I don't think it was those kids they were chasing away I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a No no, you're not thinking big enough, if it were true, Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become Aren't you even curious? Hey, aren't you guys coming? Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air Will I be able to find it? And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Nooo. I think so. Scully I... How did I get here? Hi. We came by to see how your husband was doing. Do you think, maybe, we could see him. They got to her Scully. They were here, they must Why? I saw something I... What is your interest? I did see something, but it's gone, they took it from Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely They're here, aren't they? Samantha? Scully. I don't know. I think so. I think I'm in a... a motel room in Providence, but... Rhode Island. I don't know. There's... t-there's blood all over me. I don't think so. I don't think it's my blood. Yeah? I can't get warm. N-no, but I, uh... I woke up on the floor with a pounding headache. I think so. I don't know. I don't remember anything. Uh... No, what day is it? I was in my apartment. I talked to you on the phone. I've been here since Friday? No. No. No. No. Yeah. I don't know. I don't remember that. If there was a crime committed, I need to know what happened. Are these your keys? Well, then, how did I get here? That's not my car. Who's Amy? No, Scully. If I've shot someone, if my weapon's been used I know you do, but it's my risk. Are you Amy? And who are you? That, uh, painting... behind you. Uh... do you think I could Who painted this? I know this house. I don't know. I've seen it before. Does this house have any I've been to that house. I don't know, but I've been there. It's about 20 miles from here, on route eight. My parents had I don't know. It just hit me. No. I remember what I saw. I had a very vivid flashback to my childhood. Except, I was No, just that it was very real. What do you think it was? Brought on by what? I feel really good right now. I think I've been here before. Maybe. I'm going to check upstairs. You mean, not without my attorney present? I had those people's blood on shirt, Scully. I was missing I'm a little confused. I don't know. I, uh... I think I may have come here as a kid. Well, my parents had a summer house in Quonochontaug, so... I don't ever remember meeting them, no. That's what I'm saying. For now. What's that? No. Why? Well, I haven't really told you anything. And you're telling me what's in that bag is evidence that I'm What's in the bag? No. Can I see what's in the bag now? Yes. No. What about the prints... in the house? Were they my prints? You're a doctor, not a lawyer, Scully. No. Only to my own ignorance. Ketamine? That's a veterinary drug, isn't it? How would that get there? Scully... you don't have to do this. What? That I was partying with a few senior citizens? Guard! Guard! I need to talk to someone! Guard! I didn't kill those people, Scully. From where? But I was there. And I still don't remember why. And I contacted her. But why shoot herself and her husband? What was I doing there, Scully, and why didn't I do anything I still need to know why, though. I don't know, but we found my car. What was the name of that psychologist? Dr. Goldstein? My name is Fox Mulder. Have we met? How do you mean, aggressive? Is this an accepted form of medical treatment? But you had no idea...you had no indication she might have taken That won't be necessary. I have been here before. I met Dr. Goldstein with Amy Cassandra. I think you're right. I'm fine. Give me the car keys. Scully, I don't want these symptoms to go away. Whatever's To my mother's, in Greenwich. I need to speak to you. You've kept things from me. You've kept secrets from me. You told me that, when they took Samantha, it was because you I wanna know what happened that night on Quonochontaug, and You know who. The man who worked with my father, the man who Yes! You betrayed my father, your husband. How far back did it go? Who is my father? Just answer the question, mom. Just answer the question! What did you do to me? You treated me. I asked you to treat me to recover my past. You put a hole in my head. It triggered my memory. Now I want you to finish the job. Let's do it. I wanna remember. Leave me alone, Scully. Scully, leave me alone. It's... all falling into place. No. Don't try to stop me. Get away! Shut up!
Kill me now.
I'm having that same problem right now. No, you know unfortunately around this time of year I always.
Thank you, Jesus. No, I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just stretching my legs. Just slow down. I - I don't know what you're talking about. I'll try to find out who's in charge, all right? My name is Fox Mulder. I'm an agent with the FBI.
Nobody. We just got stopped at your Well, what do you have evidence of? Separated by what? What kind of animal? Couldn't identify as the surveyors'? Oh, just, uh...
Hold.
What about the boy's father? But no other sign of him? Do you have panther in But these tracks look like neither of those. You know of a good motel in the area? Yeah. How do I say this without using any negative words, Yeah, you see that?
We don't need It's open. Partaaayyy! Try any of that Tailhook crap on me, Scully, I'll kick your It makes me think that what we're dealing with here is no ordinary I think what we stumbled upon here is something more that what Those woods are as old as anything in the south and there's I got to check something out. I'll be back soon, and we can build a tower of furniture.
What is it, Louis?
Be right back. He's still freaked out. The Invisible Man was invisible. Yeah, he said he was chased by a creature with glowing red eyes. Let me show you something.
But when she came back, the door was locked from the inside. Look at this. We got some tracks here. Here, and here... dried mud against the tile, tracked in from No, no. You see, uh, the ball of the foot here? Well, I'm not saying it is. The weight distribution is No. My dad and I were Indian Guides. I know these.
I found some tracks – right here. Well, whatever it is, it's attacked three grown men, presumably By identifying it. Finding it before it finds somebody That's pretty sophisticated for government issue. I don't think it's a drifter, Scully, and we may be looking Well, that thing lured that woman out of the house last night Divide and conquer. If your enemy has greater numbers Encroaching development. That's what I suspected when That survey team was staking out a new 100,000 acre plot. Civilization Where is it? I don't see it. Scully!!
Scully! What happened? They separated us. That was on purpose. They divided You're right. We got to find her. I don't know! We'll form a line and beat the bushes. The longer we wait, the less chance we have of finding her. Okay. You're right. You go back. You leave We have to find her.
All right. We all go then.
So far all it's done is split us up. What does that tell you? Mm hmm. Maybe it can regulate its temperature. Do you know of That's interesting. 30 years ago, the, uh, the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia No, The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati is in the C's. This is the same path. This is the way we came. That's because you've had your nose glued to that screen the Where? Jeff? Where? Where? Scully, I lost it. Did you hit it? Where's Glaser? How many shots did you fire? Is that your only clip? Don't fire again unless you're sure you're gonna hit it. I don't know. But whatever it is, it's smarter than us.
Scully! Scully! Scully! Indian Guide says maybe you should run to the store and get What are you doing. Oh. And maybe it'll start raining weenies and marshmallows. No. Yes... actually. Yeah. I was told once that the best way to regenerate body heat was Yeah, once, when I was at the Ice Capades. I think Nature is supremely indifferent to whether we live or Go, girl. Hey, who did you identify with when you were a kid? Yes! I did, too. But where are they today?
Yeah. But there seem to be only two of them. I don't wanna wrestle. One of us has got to stay awake, Scully. If you get tired, you wake me. Why don't you sing. something. Well, if you sing something, I'll know you're awake. It doesn't matter. Just sing anything. Chorus. Scully?! What are you doing? I wouldn't go far. Scully?
Scully? Where? You all right? What's down there? Scully, what's going on? Are you okay? Is she alive? Is there a way out? Yeah? Hold on, I'm going to drop my gun down.
Don't.
Scully! Too bad we don't have any office furniture. Go, team. 20 more bodies and we'll win the Honey-Baked We're down here! We've got injured people down here. No, on the contrary, Agent Kinsley, we would never have gotten in this if not for you. Yeah, you see this? There was something in the cave that Scully fell into , an inscription Ad Noctum. It means into darkness. The Spanish Conquistadors used Ponce De Leon came here 450 years ago looking for the Fountain After 400 years in the woods don't you think they might have Why do you say that? I wouldn't be surprised if they couldn't find either one of These predators have been in these woods for a long, long time.
Where's Agent Scully? She did? Excuse me. Scully!? Scully!!!??
Let's get out You pack everything? They? The Night Chicago Died?
Was Jerry Stevens or his friends ever witnessed participating in witchcraft? I think with a few turquoise chips, a picture of John Better hide your Megadeth albums. The homicide did have a ceremonial presentation... the I didn't want to incite his already clearly aggravated So... lunch? I guess their parachutes didn't open. You Witch Hunt.
A History of the Occult in America..
If you didn't kill Jerry Stevens, Of us?
There's no evidence to warrant an arrest.
They again.
Our investigation.
The water... It's going down the drain counter-clockwise! Coriolis Something's here, Scully. Something is making these.
Your records indicate a high incidence.
I'm assuming you're familiar with the early In your counselling you've found no evidence of past ritual Would it be possible for me to speak to any of the students For the body of student of complaints, he was pretty quick.
Well, he's.
Where's that pulled from... the local Modern witches, known as Wicca, are a religion. Shannon! You're remembering! Imagine... if what she said is true... Mr Ausbury? Did you do it? That's not a very Christian tenet. Even the Devil can quote scripture to fit his needs. Her office has a faint odour of incense. It's also used in Black Mass rituals. What do you mean, oddities? Flesh-eating bacteria?
That's very No, I've got a feeling this is something we both should Did you abuse Shannon? The rituals. Like... drinking grape juice instead of wine at Communion? Did the others kill Jerry Stevens? But you are responsible. You knew the possibilities Who are the others? Scully?
I've got Scully!
You called me! You said you Ausbury confessed to conspiracy. He was going to There's no evidence of any reaction of the wood from the You really do watch the Learning Channel. We know about that. Paramedics must be tied up by the storm. You just Paddock. Scully. Thanks for coming. I didn't want to waste any time. A Navy destroyer escort, Yeah, there's been no radio contact, no distress signals Well, that's what it looked like until last night. Only one of those survivors is still alive. That's what I was hoping you could tell me. Meet me back in my office when you're finished. Did they let you in to see Lt. Harper? What do you mean? I want to show you something, Scully. It's more like a wrinkle in time, if Lt. Harper is any indication. You know anything about the Philadelphia Experiment? Except none of those scientists ever made it to Los Alamos. Roswell, New Mexico. Less than nine months after the alleged crash of a UFO in Those physicists may have been trying to manipulate Actual portals where matter interfaces with time at a I'll find out soon enough. I'M BOOKED ON AN 8.
30 flight to I'm giving myself a 24-hour head start before I give 0 for 5. How do you feel about the sea north of Beerenburg? So you've been there? A number of things. How good are you? When can we leave? Uhhh... You're lucky you inherited your father's legs. His sea legs.
It's been about 12 hours. How much longer 'til we get there? The USS Ardent. It's a destroyer escort. Scully.
Let's check the Like they've been dead a very long time. An engine. Hey! Hey! All right.
Try it again. It's caked with the same residue that's covering everything. What we're seeing here may be the result of some kind An artificial time band, where matter moves through time Time may be speeding up. The ship... the ship was launched in 1991. I don't What happened? Who are you? Here you go. There's no way he killed Halverson. That means there's somebody else on board. Put it down! Put down the pipe! Put it down! Back off, Trondheim! He may be our only chance to figure out what happened. You know him? Ask him how he got here. We'll question him later. I don't want to leave Scully I think we found who killed Halverson. Maybe we should ask the Captain some more questions. Is that what this substance is? All right, we're all tired. Let's stow the captain's body Scully? You want a few more minutes? Scully... Then theoretically it's possible. What else could it be? We're the evidence, Scully! Look at us! Relax, relax, Trondheim. Save your energy. Nobody twisted your arm. Is this a quiz? Grow old, you mean? So you think something is triggering that reaction in us? It makes sense, Scully. The organic equivalent to rust It's not blood, Scully. It's rust. Trondheim, you keep an I'm not sure yet, but we don't have much time to get there. See this yellow pipe? It's the only one that hasn't Olafsson and his men. This is the only drinkable water on the ship. We were Something must have gotten into the desalination tanks.
The water from this tank may do What happened? You were supposed to watch him.
I want to know what happened? There's nothing wrong with my knot! Let go of me. It's the water, Trondheim. Something got into the I think I just lapped George Burns. You're almost out of pages. It's good you kept a record. You go ahead and drink it. It's the only logical choice, Scully. You're a woman. You have a much greater chance of surviving until help Don't be so stubborn, Scully. You know I'm right. There might be. The outer hull must have finally corroded through, I always thought when I got older I'd maybe take a cruise I'm so tired.
Milepost 134.
Two miles to go.
Because of where this particular crackpot works.
Groom Lake. Area.
It's all our questions.
The proof that we've suspected but never.
What is your point?
This is a normal life.
I don't know if we're going to meet that crackpot after all.
Why? It's a public highway.
What are you doing out here?
Oh, if I had the name, I'd give it to you.
Sir, you're absolutely right.
And on behalf of Agent Scully and.
Why are you doing this?
Mulder.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I guess you were right, Scully.
Just another.
Hey, Scully?
I, uh, know it's not your normal life, But we do have a free copy of the Watchtower for you if you'd like.
So routine, it numbs the mind. Hey, Scully, take a look at this.
Thank you, Captain. That's no problem.
See you soon.
Come on, Scully. Just one quick side trip. Running down people that buy fertilizer? This is scut work, You saw that news report. What did you make of that? In the words of their captain she just sort of popped. And Why can't we see him? 40-year-old roofer. No history of mental illness. What do you think? I'm going to stay here and see if I can see Crump. Captain, where's Montello? So that's where it started. That's Crump's home. Then he Yeah, but you caught up with him in Wells. Where's that? So that means that he started off in this direction. Then all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's going to be a little tough, Scully. How about if we just pull over and let me out, too, huh? What figures? Hey! No!
That is... so stupid, Crump. That is so stupid. What? What am I doing?
I'm composing a sonnet. Crump? Is this what happened to your wife? This same thing? I don't know how well you recall the last 30 seconds but Just tell me everything you know. That may be the only Shut up. I'm guessing we got two or three miles before the Check your window. Crump? Crump, what else can you tell me about what's Mister. I got you. I can think of something else I'd like to call you. I could.
Excuse me?
It's Mr. Mulder to you, you peanut-picking bastard. What? What do you mean? I can't... I can't go... I can't go left. There's only trees there. Crump... It's west. Huh, west? You got to head west. One more time. You woke up this morning... then what? You woke up this morning but you didn't go to work. Why? What was your wife doing? You looked up. What caused it? I'm sorry about your wife. Crump... You think the government did this to you? Well, on behalf of the international Jewish conspiracy I just Okay, Crump, we got about one more mile. I'll make it fast. Hey, turn on the pump! Number four! Three! Number three! I'm doing 70. Okay.
That was an apology, right? Gee, I don't know Why am I doing what? It's not in your best interest to make me question that I guess you don't. Hey, you got to stay alive if you want to stick it to the We'll figure this out. Crump? Mr. Crump...
Yeah, aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal...
Headed where?
I'm guessing wherever the hell route 36 ends.
Well, lay it on me.
Yeah. It uses an antenna, like, 50 miles long.
Not to mention that as a potential weapons.
But with constant movement somehow.
The big question, Scully, is what do we do.
We'll be there. Well, whether they did this to you intentionally or not, Your one chance is that we meet my partner at the end Sure. Why don't you bill me? Okay. So are we done here? Back to the bozo work Krycek, what's up? What kind of situation? And they want me? What for? Yeah. This is Agent Krycek. What does he want? Passage to where? Is he lucid? Like what? Yeah, yeah, but I've never been in a hostage negotiation before. Do we know anything about his abduction experiences? Is that a problem? If this man is an abductee, I need to know more about him, his And nobody's thought to call the hospital for records? Duane? This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I think I know what you're going through, Duane. I just want I know you're scared, Duane, and that you'd like to see this We're only concerned about your safety, Duane. You and the others. You need someone to trust, Duane. Nobody's going to try anything, Duane. And you didn't think to mention that? The point being that the bureau wants to minimize it's embarrassment, Well, you're off to a hell of a start. Well, if you just wanted somebody to come down and read the No, no, that man is afraid. And the only way you're going to Well, then understand that you might have to alter your approach It's me. I'm in Virginia. What's the media saying? Well, what they're not telling you is that he's former F.B.I. Yeah, his name's Duane Barry. Look, Scully, I need your help. The lights just went out here. What's the number there? Duane? Is everybody all right, Duane? No, I, I believe you. I just need to know if... Yeah. Don't jump into his delusion. I can't negotiate with him if Duane? We're unarmed. No. No. We're just here to help. Nobody's going to try anything, Duane. We just want to make sure no one else gets hurt. They want to work with you, Duane, but you got to work with Then let the women go. Well, we lost time. I checked my watch. Isn't that what happens? Isn't that what they've been saying to you, Duane? That you're I hear you, Duane. No. I believe your story. I know you're afraid. I know the pain and the fear you must I've talked to people, Duane. People just like you, and nobody Why don't you let him go, Duane? There's no reason this man Good. You made the right choice. Now, we're just going to move I'm telling the truth, Duane. It happened to my sister. How does it happen, Duane? Driving in your car? Alone in bed There are beings, aren't there, Duane? Are they tall or small? Diminutive... You're powerless. Sometimes, you can't even speak. It's always That's right. Abductees call it mindscan. It's a kind of telepathy. They take you aboard the ship to perform the tests. She was eight. What are they doing to them? Are they hurting them? You can let the others go, Duane. Let the others go and take I don't care about that, Duane. Who in the government? You're going to have to deal with resolving this situation, There's no other way out. You've got to tell them what you want What place? Where is that? How do they find you each time? Why not let the women go, Duane? They'll deal with you if you The women are of no consequence to you. Let them go. It's the What do you want, Duane? A car? Do you know where you want to go? Duane, you can't leave here if you don't know where you want Come here. There... there's something I want to ask you. You didn't believe me. I had to earn your trust. Now, there's No... No, I don't. I'm sorry. Duane, will you listen to me for a second? Duane... Duane, I do believe you. I believe you! No! I believe you, Duane! Can I say... can I say something? Duane, can I say something? Yeah. It's just that, uh... I believed him. No, I was surprised to get your call. I don't know, I guess I thought maybe you called me down here The fine thread of sanity. It was right where he said it would be, Scully. Along with the Well, if it was, that would mean Duane Barry is telling the Conceivably. Possibly. It's feasible. Swamp gas? Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs. How can a dozen witnesses including a squad of police vehicles in three counties become hysterical over swamp gas? The only question for me is, why was the truck driver singled out? Yeah, it can play tricks on you. But not like this. Mr. Ranheim, I'd appreciate it if you could elaborate on the report you filed last night regarding your encounter. Last night, you said it was cigar-shaped and black. Ok. So, how long have you not been yourself? I'd like to examine the truck. This man has had an alleged close encounter. The truck undoubtedly contains important trace evidence. Not... not here. It's obvious someone got to the police chief. Ranheim was hiding something. He only became sick last night. UFOs are frequently witnessed by soldiers during wartime. What if that's what made the soldiers in Iraq sick? The exhaust or fuel from a classified aircraft or its weapon. They'd deny it, but it could possibly explain how Ranheim developed his symptoms. I want to talk to some people when we get back to Washington. No, these guys are like an extreme government watchdog group. They publish a magazine called "The Lone Gunman." Some of their information is first-rate, covert actions, classified weapons. Some of their ideas are downright spooky. Is that so? Barney? Settle down, Frohike. Hey, Byers, it is a federal crime to deface money. O... o... ok, alright. What do you know about the Gulf War Syndrome? Have you heard of any classified planes being flown during the Persian Gulf War? What about UFO activity during that period? I think it's remotely plausible that someone might think you're hot. What's the matter? Hello? Yeah. What are we doing here? That's too bad. Something tells me you have the connections to get great seats. It's just a tourist. What am I onto? We go down to investigate a truck driver's encounter with a UFO and the next thing, we're discovering electronic surveillance equipment. Who's listening to us? We had it. Let's just say it's a source with a deep background. All I know is that he's guided us away from harm. That tells me that not everything is as it appears to be. He's never lied to me. I won't break that confidence. I trust him. Then you're gonna have to trust me. Ok, we've got to try and intercept it and see what's on board. You risked exposure coming here. Is that where the Iraqi wreckage is being held? Are UFOs monitoring the area? Wait, wait. This is the best photographic evidence I have ever seen. When I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I knew they were a hoax but this... this is the quality of evidence the government has amassed for decades at the highest classified levels. That business with the truck was just a decoy to keep anyone from looking closely away from Fort Benning where they are keeping the remains of the Iraqi UFO. We have to leave for Georgia immediately, Scully... What? There can be an off-camera light source creating that shadow. There's probably a degree of tint in the windshield or the gradation could be attributed to atmospheric conditions. Why don't you just admit it, Scully? You're determined not to believe him. I am determined to follow a lead that may result in proof of the existence of extraterrestrial biological entities. I need to go. No. Thank you. I had the photo analyzed by the bureau's computers. Initially, it appears to be legitimate. The film grain matches, the pattern and density, color levels, shading... then I noticed this. The photograph was a fake. I thought you were my ally. Yeah, imagine if Eisenhower told the rest of the Allies that D-Day would take place in Belgium. Then why did you lie to me? Who are you to decide that for me? Dangerous. You mean in a sense of outrage like the reaction to the Kennedy assassinations or M.I.A.s or radiation experiments on terminal patients, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee experiments, where will it end? Oh, I guess it won't end as long as... men like you decide what is truth. That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi pilot, that was the truth, wasn't it? Why'd you even bother to show it to me? Hey, Scully, glad you could drop by. I been thinking about this whole situation, y'know? And I think you're right. I think we won this one, I think we should just move on. Called every weigh station and bureau office west of Colorado. Tied up an airphone for three hours. I don't speak Japanese, but I think some businessman told me to stick a piece of sushi where the sun don't shine. At least we can be sure they didn't trace our call. I couldn't find the truck. Did you have any luck? Y'know, think about it. This truck drove across America. People it passed on the road probably thought it was hauling auto parts or furniture. Y'know, livestock, whatever. Nobody would have suspected it was hauling a craft from another world. Well, if that were the case... You all right? Come on. Scully? It was an extraterrestrial biological entity... alive. I think we were just witness to a rescue mission. Are you asking me if it was real? Did we just have a close encounter? Whatever they used, we probably haven't heard of it. Sound weapons, stealth helicopters with an ultra-intensity light. It doesn't matter, there's no evidence that this was a UFO. Just to kill us? Yeah, I wondered that myself. Maybe they're using me against myself like you said before. That I want to believe so badly that I'd just accept the obvious conclusions and walk away. There's still one person in all this who hasn't lied to us. But it's not quite someone we can turn to.
Leverling and Priest Rapids? East bank of the Columbia River? Did you send a field investigator? And you can substantiate the sighting? Ok, Nick, thanks a lot. And after last night's hoax... look at this. Looks like they want their colleague back. What's over there? Hello. You've seen UFOs? This is it. There's Ranheim. Just the kind of challenge they're looking for. It's Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off. Turn it off! How would you like to have, on your front page, the first substantiated photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity? Just hack me some identification numbers. Braidwood and Stefoff. 7-5-9-3. Thanks. Langley said he couldn't get into Level 6, so that's where we... We have to go back, we have to go through that door. Well, we'll have to find another access, then. Come on. Yeah, we're lost, we're just looking for, we're trying to... Yeah, if you could help us... I'm wondering which lie to believe. Tres dias. Muy incredible, no? Well, according to eyewitnesses, the death we're investigating Yeah. Witnesses described a bright flash about 30 Yeah. Great album. Deeply flawed movie, though. Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters, cattle I would assume so. Nobody cares, Scully. The victim and many of the I thought it might be important to talk to them. No La Migra! No La Migra! No La Migra. It's all right. We don't want to take anybody away. We want to know what happened to Maria Dorantes.
Yeah, its a Mexican folktale.
Did you see the Chupacabra? Uh, how do you explain the uh, the yellow rain and the I doesn't make a whole lot of sense, Scully. I admit, there's a strong suspicion of motive and intent Local cops don't care, Scully. I don't know who Find out what killed Maria Dorantes. Take Try to find this man, Eladio Buente.
Agent Lozano? We're investigating the death of a migrant worker. I'm looking for a man named Eladio Buente. He hasn't So you are telling me that no one here uses their real Possibly the murder of a woman named Maria Dorantes. Yeah. You've heard of it. You don't believe I've heard that. Why is he segregated like this? They think he's the Chupacabra. Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes. What did he say? Ask him what happened. Hmm. What's going to happen to him? There any way to delay that? Try to solve an unexplained death. Yeah, I found him. Not exactly, no. Flash of light... yellow rain. Maria!
A fungus? And it can kill? You don't think that's weird. It still doesn't explain the flash of light and the yellow What does it look like? The same fungus that killed Maria Dorantes?
Did you Agent Lozano, this is my partner, Agent Scully. I'm not so sure about that, Scully. I'm not questioning that, but right now Eladio Buente Good. You should do that. While Agent Lozano.
The story's out. So they really don't think he's the Chupacabra? Did you tell them about the fungal infection? What will become of him? He'll kill him So we got to find him first. Well, in this case, he'll curse the man who doesn't.
Hey, Scully. Where are you?
Responsible, how?
How's he spreading it?
I saw this man, Scully. He was unaffected.
You're saying it's a new strain? Lozano, careful.
Scully, I've been.
Created by a meteorite or a piece of.
Oh, and the fungus...
Kay. Eladio! I lost him!
Uh! Agent Lozano! How does this man keep eluding us? What about his brother, Soledad? Have you seen either of them? I think we should hold up a moment. Something's going on here. That's our man. Drop the gun! Apurate! Drop it! He's been here. Eladio? Eladio Buente? How's he going to get to Mexico? How are we going to find this man? I don't know what to believe anymore, Scully. These He won't.
She's lying. The same place Agent Lozano and Eladio's brother are going. God curses the man who stands between two brothers. I don't blame you. At any rate, we arrived just after the hazmat team...
They established a perimeter, then secured.
Except on the body of Agent Lozano.
Apparently, the brothers paid this man for Outer space, sir.
The truth is, nobody cares. Hey, Scully, take a look at this. The pin setter. You see the way it's wedged and Mr. Pintero said the only way that would happen would No one's suggesting that you are, Mr. Pintero. Can I ask you a favor? Can I get a soda, a cola, Thanks. What is that look, Scully? What, you don't believe in ghosts? Sounds more like a disembodied soul. Except according to Mr. Pintero, this one was trying to Yeah. It's a spirit being that arrives as a harbinger This is the third reported sighting in as many weeks... I don't know yet but, uh,... Pintero, who has returned She is me. Written onto the wax - she is me - look at this! No, not at all. No, actually I do have something to add. I think that I'm Special Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. No, no, not the victim. Her apparition, what the Were there any written messages in any of these other Do the words she is me have any meaning to you? Those were her dying words? Well who made that call? What do you mean? And no one followed up on this lead? I'd appreciate that. Hi. I wanted to ask if anybody used the pay phone That was Sloppy Joe night.
Anybody.
The quiet man in the back. The only one who didn't raise his hand, yeah. Has Do you think I could talk to him.
A wedding ring, yeah. So what, he stole her ring? Oh, he switched it. Nice catch, Scully. Any idea about the psychology Not ordinarily unless there was a more complex psychology I'm not sure if the killer is here, but certainly the No but he's about to. You made that phone call, didn't you Harold? Did you say the words she is me? Have you ever heard those words? Have you ever seen a ghost, Harold? So why all of a sudden? That outburst didn't come until after I'd asked him if Yeah. I'm sure Harold Spuller is the man that made that phone Uh huh, and the other apparitions, like the one Mr. Pintero Oh Scully... You sure?
Scully? Scully, you in there?
They found another victim. Her name was Loren Heller, age 21. She's single, No, actually it doesn't. Harold's not at the home. Yeah, but I think we should be the ones to find him, if What? You want me to drive you? You're sure? Yeah, I'm looking for Harold Spuller. Suspicion of murder. You obviously don't think so, huh? You know where he is now? He has a key? Did you ever get lane 6 working? Harold? Harold?
Harold? Harold, you knew those women Missy Shapiro. Michelle Chamberlain. What was her shoe size? Harold, there are people who think that you murdered these Mr. Pintero? I'd like to search the building for Thanks. I'm hoping it will become clear to us when we find it. I think so. Choose a name. Pick a name, pick any name up there. 200 game. that's not bad. Including the victims. I'm not sure exactly, but I think that... Hey Scully. Is it too late? I needed your help on something. I needed your medical Harold Spuller. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even ask Good. Angie Pintero, the bowling alley guy? He's dead. Natural causes. Congestive heart failure. No. Howard Spuller had a preminatory vision of his Harold saw an apparition - what may have been Angie Pintero's Because I was standing right there when he saw it. No. I don't have that facility, that kind of connection to I don't know its exact nature but I think it has something Yeah, from the bowling alley, going back seven years. No, but he does have something in common with those who've Well, they were all dying... one of emphysema, one of Well that's what I need your medical opinion on. I would be very surprised. What is a death omen Thanks for accommodating us again. I understand. Agent Scully's a doctor. If you can arrange to have Tell me exactly what happened. Did he say anything? I want you to call the police. Ask for Detective I don't see that there's any way around that. Sorry. Well, that's a superficial head wound, Scully. He Maybe Harold is sicker than we thought he was. I think there's someone you can talk to about it.
You're cut. Yeah, but why did you even suspect her? Why do you think she killed those women? She is me. Yeah. They found in an alley a few blocks from here, Well, preliminary diagnosis is apnea - respiratory failure. Well, the paramedics are at a loss to explain that, but Is that your medical opinion? What?
Why didn't you tell Is that why you came down here, to prove that it wasn't Why can't you be honest with me? Is that what you think I want to hear? You can believe what you want to believe, Scully, but I hope that's the truth. Excuse me, I'm looking for the special needs ward.
Thanks.
What are you coloring? Have you ever seen Mr. Potato head? He looks like this. I found Emily's surrogate mother. I had Frohike hack into the California Social Yeah, her mother of record is one Anna Fugazzi. Yeah, as in slang term for fake. Because there are no true records. Emily didn't come into this world through any Have you asked yourself that? Someone, who's proven that they'll do anything to protect her or their interest in her. Yeah, but who's going to protect you? Emily's adoptive parents are both dead, by no Why didn't you call me sooner? And I should have declined... if I never want to see you hurt or harmed in any way. Because I know something that I haven't said... Something that they'll use against you She was missing for 4 weeks, that's documented in the file. Yes, all of them.
I believe it can, and was. That Emily Sim was conceived as a result of those I don't know how else to explain it. A medical exam of Ms. Scully would show that I included this information in anticipation of your reaction and how it might look if No, but the fact remains, Ms. Scully is the mother of this child. Well, if you can show me a legal precedent for this case, I'd like to see it.
Dana has When's she due? I never expected this. I thought I was protecting you. I only know that genetic experiments were being done, that children were being For who? For what? I don't know.
I need to trace a call. I have an incoming call to residential line 555-0380.
Don't hang up.
Okay, thanks. I got a trace. County Anyone been here the last half hour? Scully? There's something on her neck. All right, I'll try back later.
I spoke to the social worker.
She Do you know what that is? Wait! Stop!
Move away from her! Get away She still sleeping? The ER doctor is in and out of consciousness. If Emily was someone's creation, then it occurred to me that she might share the She was also being treated.
Yeah, but it's not beyond Dr. Calderon. What can I say to convince you? So, I'm wasting your time.
This isn't worth the life of a three year old girl. Okay then. Yeah. I'm following Dr. Calderon. Is she all right? Whatever he injected her with I don't think he meant to harm her. I think Dr. Calderon went there to treat her. As a bluff. I don't think they want her dead either, Scully, but for different reasons. Anna Fugazzi? Your name is Anna Fugazzi? No, I'm not.
Is that your real name? Not until now. Evelyn Burmeister.
That makes 8 for 8. No I'm at the maternity ward. I think you might have a shot here Frohike.
Do you know anything about There's two prescriptions on their med charts that all these women have in common. Hormones. You would these. Anna? There's a doctor that comes to visit you. a Dr. Calderon. No, actually, I'm looking for him. Your beauty sleep. What is that? Who are you? Detective Kresge, I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. Run. Get out of here. Kresge... Don't fire, Kresge!
The bullets go right through Calderon. Green oozes out I'm an FBI agent. I have an emergency situation. I need an ambulance and I need I don't know where I am.
You have your weapon. I have back up coming. I need a location though. Detective Kresge is going to radio in the location. But if you could treat her... Are you sure? I think she was born to... serve an agenda. All right. I'll stay with you. I don't know. But the fact that you found her... and had a chance to love her... Then So you could save her. He's doing better. He's already out of the ICU. They've already cleaned up the nursing home. All the women have been placed in.
What?
You got something going on with the pizza man I should know about?
Well, correct me if I'm wrong but you just said you were waiting for the.
Thank you.
Well, uh, yeah, but small technicality.
Mad About You was about a.
I do, I do.
What-what I'm trying to say is that, uh... we have no good.
... is not above suspicion.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, I was going through some stuff after my mother died and, um, it's.
Little Caesar, I presume?
$29.08?
What'd she get on it, a tank of gas?
Scully?
Scully!
Call 911.
Her doctor is Dr. Speake.
She.
No.
How'd you find out?
Excuse me.
Mulder.
Speaking.
Who?
I can't help you, Agent Reyes, for so many reasons.
I think.
Call me when you get here.
Agent Reyes?
You keep on alluding to a time that we've met and I don't remember.
Yeah.
Um, I have somewhere I have to be... if we could cut to the chase.
No, I'm not at all familiar with Agent Doggett.
I wasn't aware of this.
You were the lead investigator?
You said this case involves some kind of phenomenon?
Changed?
Into what?
What do you think it means?
Hey!
Hey!
Take it easy!
Take it easy, Agent Doggett.
I don't want anything on you.
I was asked to look into this file.
Why don't you just calm down, Agent Doggett and let her explain the.
Bob Harvey.
Does that name mean something or nothing to you?
That's it.
Good.
Well, that'd make sense.
It's not my office anymore but old habits die hard.
Cases involving images like you described.
People close to crimes who.
Absolutely nothing.
These visions are so random as to have absolutely no.
I think I know these files.
I think that's a coincidence.
I think that life is full of them.
I think there's an opening coming up in this office soon.
You might want to.
I have a, uh, sick friend in the hospital and, uh, I think I should go see her.
You'll say anything, won't you?
Been asking myself that same question, Agent Doggett.
But it seems the.
She's got a murder victim out here, a woman found shot.
She thinks it's.
She wants to know if you see it, too.
What she's been seeing.
Whoo.
You just keep shooting till you hit something, don't you?
I saw Elvis in a potato chip once.
Yes, I do.
I do.
But if this man doesn't see it, he doesn't see it, right?
You awake?
What did the doctor say?
But you're going to be fine?
I've actually been out in the field with Agent Doggett and this, um, female.
Yeah.
You're nothing at all alike.
Yeah.
Actually, one that involves Agent Doggett's son, the son who died.
You can't help a man who can't help himself.
Agent Doggett...
She just fell back to sleep.
And now you're wondering if there really was a connection.
You know.
Uh, I'm not really a good test for questions like that.
I'll believe almost.
Well, then you'd be seeing something that I don't, Agent Doggett.
That's cool.
We can just wait for the cheese to congeal and eat it later.
You miss your regular pizza man, don't you?
I bet you forgot about that, didn't you?
And?
Is it what you imagined?
Oh, my, that's the wrong doll, actually.
Good morning.
Here's a story to warm the cockles of your heart.
Ah.
It's not the miracle I'm suspicious of.
It's the messenger.
Someone at DARPA.
How'd you hear about it?
You subscribe to the Goochland Guardian?
So this just appeared miraculously on your.
Someone wants us on this case.
Not yet.
I'm going to go back over to DARPA.
You see what.
I've just got to know whether it was Roma Downey or Della Reese.
Hey, Scully, it's me.
Pick up if you're there.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know how many people have died in there?
You said she was, uh, carrying a suitcase.
Did you notice.
Her driver?
Her mother doesn't know anything about a family emergency.
I know she can take care of herself.
It's just not like her to.
She's in trouble.
It's the masters of disguise.
Well, what does this have to do with finding Scully?
Who the hell is Cobra?
Scully would have told me about him.
I don't believe that.
She knows that I'd find her, no matter what.
I don't believe that, either.
Give me that.
Sir, I need your attention.
No. She's away from her desk.
I wouldn't just bust in here but.
That's my question exactly.
I believe you've all met.
Are you aware of a federal fugitive, code name Cobra?
No. What they're pulling up is Scully's correspondence back to.
No. Somebody posing as Scully who hacked into her computer.
Smoking man.
Or someone working for him.
You got to get.
Well, if you don't get to him it may be the last time we see.
He used you.
You saw what you needed to see in order to make you believe.
Even if we could convince his parents to let us march him out how.
He did it all for himself....
to get the science on that.
No, he knows what that science is worth, how powerful.
Scully? Are you there? Scully? What's going on? Who was that? I, I was trying to reach you. I went by your house but you weren't I, I, I did call. I, I couldn't get through. Scully, what are you doing? What's wrong? Scully, it's me... Okay, I'm going to take my left hand and reach into my pocket Where is he? Scully? How do you know? There's no sign of a break-in. She wouldn't have just let him Why, why does he want to kill you? How? That would kill anybody. Fairly sure? From what? No, no, no, no, no... that's just it. It doesn't seem incredible You're sure? And if he doesn't get it? No, it's not hard. It's unbelievable. After twenty-two years, why come back? No, no, you've explained only what you had to! I know next to A colony? What are they trying to accomplish? And in the meantime? All the clones worked in abortion clinics, why? And this man... why has he been sent to kill them? That's a good story... but I've heard a lot of good stories Who is it? The door's open. Orders from my opthamologist. Yeah, I'm fine. I haven't checked my messages. This is my sister, Samantha Mulder. I haven't had time to explain, Agent Scully is missing. Hello. Scully, where are you? Well, what does he want? All right, tell him we'll negotiate. All right, let me speak to him. Scully, I need time, I need more time than that. We don't, we don't have any time. If I ever needed your help, We just need to get him out of the car. Make him think we're These guys can hollow out a dime at two-hundred yards. Scully, you all right? Yeah? There's no way out. We've got both sides of the bridge covered. Let her go! You should be in the hospital, Scully. Nothing yet. You think she could've survived? Well, maybe she went into hypothermic shock. I've heard about I couldn't tell you. Cause you'd never let me go through with it. Why would you even question me on that? Well, it was her. He's an alien. I already told Skinner, that was the easy part. Now I got to Samantha's gone... Dad. I lost her. There was a man... he was holding my partner hostage in exchange I, I can't explain it to you, but, um... I believed I was doing Yes. I'll tell Mom. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. Mulder. Scully, she left a path in case we got separated. I think she's Why? What'd you find? Are you sure? What about a second body? Did you find a second body? I'll be there as soon as I can. Federal agent. Put your hands where I can see them and turn What the hell is going on? Who are you? It was all a lie. Who? He's dead. He was shot. In the back of the neck! He fell off a bridge... with one of you. I'm not your savior. No, I... I do have a choice and my choice is to walk out of What about the others? No. Wait. There were women in here. No. You've got to keep looking... How was the opera? I'm sorry. I need your help. I need to know what you know. No. One of them is alive, the one who was sent to kill them. I got to get up there. Scully, when you get this message, I will be too far away for Hey! Step out of there! Don't look at me, face forward! So why did you run? How is it you managed to survive? No. I'm just tired and you're not getting back to your ship Base of the neck! Now, you tell me how I can find her and I'll Where is she? Where is she? Like I got a bad case of freezer burn. How did I get here? I... I'm sorry, I... I couldn't let you risk your life on this. No. No. But I... I found something I thought I'd lost. Faith.
We call it the miracle of life.
Conception.
A union of perfect.
Or is this just nostalgia now?
An act of biology.
But has our ingenuity rendered the miracle into a simple trick?
How did this child come to be?
What set its heart beating?
Is.
And what do I tell myself?
Never give up on a miracle.
You can drop the Agent, Agent Doggett.
It's just plain old Fox Mulder.
That's what I was doing.
Slightly different race though.
Zeus Genetics.
That ring a bell?
Looks like somebody's attempt to make sure it never will be.
I think that's the idea... to cover up the kind of research that was going on.
How about a ride?
Agent Doggett?
Hey, I hope you don't mind me dropping your name with the local PD.
That would probably stand to reason.
Pissing people off comes with the territory, Agent Doggett.
It's part of.
Hey, I told you Dr. Lev was a founder of the clinic.
Would you like to.
I don't know, but if I'm the Agent assigned to the X-Files, I sure as hell.
Knock, knock.
I'll just say I'm with you, Agent Doggett.
It's Saturday anyway, right?
Me?
I'm with an FBI agent who would like to ask you the exact same question.
What is this?
Some kind of showroom?
Does that work include experimentation with alien embryos?
Work that.
From a friend of mine... a former patient of yours... Dana Scully.
Is she?
You found something, didn't you?
Anything else?
Let's ask Dr. Parenti... if it's okay with Agent Crane.
The man loves his work.
Agent Doggett.
Look at this.
Ahh! Scully.
I see why you gave up a career in medicine for the FBI.
Imagine if he'd really connected.
Billy Miles.
Ask Agent Doggett.
He saw him.
Ask me, the kid isn't a kid.
He is a type of alien.
A human replacement.
One who looks human.
Look.
Well, then, you're ignoring who Billy Miles is.
You, of all people, Agent.
Well, Billy Miles is a whole new deal.
He's an alien abductee who was.
Same thing would've happened to me if I'd been left alone.
If Scully hadn't treated me.
Same as when he torched Zeus Genetics and destroyed their experiments.
Looking for answers.
One of those doctors was your doctor.
Listen, Scully, I'm sorry, but I just need to know that this baby of yours is.
That's... that's all I'm trying to do.
Just make sure nothing happens to you,.
And what point would that be?
What?
You said there'd been a murder.
Ahh...
Yeah, I hear there's a pool running down at the FBI.
You want to know who the father is, that's Scully's business. But if you're.
Sir, just...
Let me.
Hey, Scully, it's me.
Are you all right?
I need to see you.
I've got Skinner with me.
It's not.
It's about your pregnancy.
Skinner's got some questions based.
Evidence of interference by someone.
She's fine, according to her doctor.
Apparently, it was a false alarm.
Money from who?
But the work continued.
What other experiments?
What did you do to Scully?
What did you do to her?!
Tell me what's wrong with her!
Tell me what's wrong with her.
It's me.
You here alone?
Whatever you can't get elsewhere, just throw it together.
No, your, your baby is fine.
It's you who's in danger now, Scully.
I don't know, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure about anything.
I just know I got.
This isn't about the X-Files, Scully.
It is only about you.
Now, you are.
Mulder.
Agent Doggett...
Leave the suitcase.
Get in, go around.
I don't think that matters much, Scully.
Tell us about Billy Miles.
What about Scully?
What do they want with her?
Are you saying that they're afraid of it?
That there's a God... a higher power.
Agent Doggett.
Get on the phone.
If we're going to get Scully out of here.
You're going to protect her. I'd say the man was running on empty. Any evidence would have be washed away by yesterday's rain. Are you at all familiar with the phenomena of cattle mutilations? Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of Exsanguination. If you were to stick a needle into the jugular The ME found traces of digitalis, a South American plant that Witnesses often relate time loss. We've seen this in abduction For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys. Besides, Has she spoken about it? Any nightmares? Nice bunny, Teena. Can we talk about what happened that day? Yeah? Do you remember... any strange sounds or lights or Can you tell me more about the Red Lightning? Had you ever seen anything like that before? Yeah? When? Why were these men after your Dad? It's like looking at a mirror image. Puncture wounds? That's Pacific standard time. That makes it the exact same moment. No. Serial killers seldom work in pairs. And when they do, they Is Reardon's daughter nearby when he was murdered? When will they be back? Even money... she'll remember Red Lightning. Someone or something, Scully. Maybe they weren't looking in the right direction.
You live here, Cindy? Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs. Reardon. Is she an only child? Was she the only child delivered at that birth? Mrs. Reardon, have you ever seen this man before? No. No... he... he did... he didn't... In vitro fertilization? At which clinic? Thanks. I don't know. The only thing similar about these girls doesn't Who both just happened to see their father's exsanguinated. One girl was just abducted. Potato, potahto. The murders were committed by the same person or persons. I'm going to keep an eye on the girl. You check out the clinic. Okay. Maybe now she's trying to erase the results? So you think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have against I'll tell you what... I'm going to sleep on it and we'll talk about it No, I'm not. What's a girl? No, I have... there's a movie I want to watch on TV. Sleep tight. Yes. What are you doing here? No you haven't. Agents Mulder and Scully. We're here to see Eve 6. What are those? Hello? They're probably there for a good reason. Where are the others? The other Adams and the Eves? Heightened psychosis. Dr. Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Lichfield Experiment. Suppose Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there. No. No, no, no. It seems the two remaining Eves are doing away I hope not. I'll take the back. FBI. I'm armed. Which one are you? Eve 7 or Eve 8? Mrs. Reardon, the fact that Kendrick and her accomplice That was a motel manager in Port Reyes that says he's got a She might have ditched it. The manager said this woman No, he remembers this kid. She told him he should use chlorine What did the other lady look like? Eve 8. They were working together. Their own mini Jonestown. Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide. Ah, maybe it would be better if we took responsibility for the girls. Yeah. Can you hold it? Hi. Where's your bathrooms? Thanks. Oh, can I get four diet sodas? Okay, two diet and two regular. To go. Please. Those are the diet? Are you sure? These are really sweet. Okay. Come on. How much? You want to pay? Thanks. You didn't pick up my keys off the counter, did you? All right. I'll be right back. SCULLY! I just wanted to open the car door for you. I only had a sip. SCULLY! I GOT THEM! SCULLY! Back off. We're federal agents. Forget your sodas? That's the last thing you are. They can't hide behind the bureaucracy, Mrs. Reardon. You have Whatever tape you found in that VCR, it isn't mine. Well, this definitely isn't mine. What happened to her? Where did you get this? Violent Crimes? Why not? I have several X-Files that document similar cases. Well, then you none of them have ever been substantiated. Given the emotional and psychological violence of rape, Why? Miss Charters, the facts of your case seem to contravene How do you know it was him who attacked you? That's right. Thank you for sharing. Are you aware you're being.
Apparently not.
About the guy's plumbing? I think this will turn out to be a huge waste of time just We met with a patient today. We met a resident who was described to us as having Ms. Dawson, did you get a chance to see Michelle Then you know how badly she was hurt. In your opinion, do you think she staged the attack? Come on, Hal. So he was actually getting better?
Is he receiving the same treatments as Hal May I sit down, Leo?
Come on, Scully. Let's get out of here.
If it would keep anybody out of a place like that Well, I hope someone's making some progress ‘cause Between the rape case and the Alzheimer's? You think that Michelle Charters was raped by an An invisible 74-year-old schizophrenic? Are you saying that the building's haunted? Why wouldn't it have affected the other residents? I think you're looking too hard, Scully, for something He doesn't seem to need much assistance now. Do you have any idea why? Give me your hand. Come on. Grab it. Apparently. Either that or he was pushed. That's what we're trying to determine. Stan was with There have been two deaths here in the past 24 hours. What about an elevator? Maybe he was helped. I don't know. The postmortem on Hal Arden – Can we check and see if it's come in yet?
I'm not sure, exactly. Is the toxicology there? What's that? What's ibotenic acid? Scully, Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood. It's fantastic. You've got an Asian orderly working here. Do you know where he is? Upshaw. But it's your mushroom crop, isn't it? Who else would have buried him there? Why? Makes them feel better, or it kills them? All right, Gung, who killed the orderly? How are the mushrooms taken? Well, I think the first thing we should do is make sure I think you're right, Scully. What's been happening is the result of the medication, Shamans have used them for centuries to gain entrance Ask any anthropologist then. I don't know how else to explain what's happening here. And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies?
Scully! Turn off the You've got to get up. Come on. You got to get up. I can't open the drains. Just hold on. It's all right. Yeah. Fine.
This is a video grab from the DC morgue.
It's Billy Miles.
Yeah. It can't be, but it is.
Walking out of the morgue looking like a new.
Which Scully is a threat to.
You heard about this, right?
He's got a concussion.
They're going to keep him here for observation.
Who?
Skinner could've been killed.
He's lucky he wasn't.
What exactly did he tell you?
I want to know who the hell you've been talking to—.
Who this trusted source of yours is who's been spinning this fantasy.
Did he ever lie to you?
Give you bad information, false leads?
Well, you have to think about it?
You didn't tell him where she is, did you?
You don't tell anybody where she is.
That's the deal, right?
This, uh, trusted source of yours told you he knows how to stop Billy Miles.
Right. Well, what do you say you and me go find out how trustworthy he.
Hey. You know, how is it that this friend of yours is so desperate for your.
You told me that he told you he knew how to stop Billy Miles.
Are you.
It doesn't make any difference at all.
Unless you want to protect Scully and.
I don't know.
Maybe it doesn't.
Start the car.
Alex Krycek just pulled in.
You recognize his passenger?
Not to see you, that's for sure.
You go ahead.
I got Krycek.
Yeah?
Agent Crane?
How the hell does he know Agent Crane?
You been wondering who's getting these guys past security.
Fooling us, Agent Doggett.
Into chasing after Billy Miles.
Yes, they know where she is.
You and Agent Reyes.
You called her from a phone inside the.
Maybe this goes even higher.
Listen to me.
I've got to get to.
No, you listen. You've got to get out of there.
You've got no.
What do you know about fair or right, Krycek?
You're a coward.
Then there really is no God.
I wanted to stop them.
All you wanted was to save your own ass.
You want to kill me, Alex, kill me.
Like you killed my father.
Just don't.
I'm going to go to the airport.
I need that location from Agent Doggett.
Skinner, are you with me?
Down there.
Get me down there.
Hey!
Scully!
Scully!
Where is she?!
Scully!
Where is she?!
How is she?
See it with your own eyes.
There was a light.
I followed it.
How's everybody doing?
Hey, now.
None of that.
Hi.
What are you going to call him?
Well, I don't know.
He's... he's got your coloring and your eyes.
But he.
I don't quite understand that either.
Except that maybe he isn't what they.
I think what we feared were the possibilities.
The truth we both know. I don't think the guards are watching enough prison movies. I thought this was about escaped prisoners. Then who are the men in the funny suits? Excuse me? No. Oh, we'd be happy to as soon as we can talk to someone in charge. Apparently not or you'd know why our involvement was requested. Where did this case originate, Scully? Did he say why he gave it to us? Well, this isn't the type of thing the F.B.I. normally gets Do you think you could get in there and find out what's going To see if I can get in the way. Mulder. What did you find? Deadly? How deadly? Well, is there a chance any of the escaped men were infected? I'd say these guys are a danger in any event. We've got a man down! He's alive. Kid's got a lot of hair, probably absorbed the blow. He found Any idea where they're headed? Either of these guys got a girlfriend, you know? Well, if they had girlfriends, they'd probably try to call them. I'm a federal agent assisting in a manhunt for two escaped prisoners. Can you repeat that, please? What's going on here, what's going on? Who are you? No! I don't know, but there was a call made from that phone booth Yeah. Uh, it's one of, if not the biggest manufacturer of drugs in Any idea what was in the package? Scully, from the description we got, one of the prisoners had Yeah, it could spread. I, I, I need to know more about it. We've got one dead prisoner in the bedroom. The other one's Thank you for seeing me at this late hour, sir. This case we've been assigned, I believe we've been misled, Whoever originated the case. That Agent Scully and I were sent on this manhunt without It's deadly. It kills within thirty-six hours. One escaped convict No, we just know that over a dozen men have died from it and Why weren't we told the truth? But innocent people could be infected! What you knew could have You can't protect the public by lying to them. I won't be a party to it. Mulder. What? Do you have proof of that? Okay, listen, Scully. I need to know how this happened. I want It's a public health crisis. Yeah, but what if he is? What if someone dies because we withheld what we knew? Are you okay in there, Scully? Elizabeth? My name is Fox Mulder, I'm with the F.B.I. Where I think you do know. Steve felt fine too. Didn't take long for that to change. You should be scared. If I were you, I'd be scared. No, Paul is the one who is lying and if he's infected, a lot That's not my decision. Elizabeth, Paul is out there somewhere. I have to find him. No! No, they don't know what they're dealing with. If he's infected, He's here. He bought a ticket to Toronto. And he's infected. Mulder. You okay, Scully? Yeah, he's headed to Toronto. But he's infected. He's going to die. Hold your men back. I'm getting on the bus. There are other passengers on board. The prisoner sees a uniform, I get on the bus, I take the seat directly behind the prisoner, There's supposed to be a man on the bus. Take the key out of the ignition and turn around slowly. I'm with the F.B.I. I need to know if this man has boarded the Federal agent! Drop your weapon! Let the boy go! You got over two dozen U.S. marshals out there, Paul. How far The question is, how many people are you going to take with You were infected in prison. And your girlfriend Elizabeth and possibly your son. You saw a package? All right, everybody, off the bus. Robert Torrence was patient zero, the first prisoner to contract Because I wanted you to hear it from me before you read it in The public has a right to know so it doesn't happen again. Eighteen people are dead, and if you're helping them cover the I thought I was dealing with you. What are you talking about? That's why we were given this assignment, right? They knew all Well, what about you, where do you stand? Then what happened out there if it wasn't a train wreck? Reclamations? He's part of a craft retrieval unit. I think you knocked out a filling. Since when does taking pictures put anyone's life at That's a quarantine? Is that what you call this? Thats a lot of firepower just to protect mother nature. You've got a downed craft in those woods, sir. And troops Go ahead. What makes you so sure that something's out there? I didn't order room service. Did you meet Max? Max from NICAP.
Oh, they must What else? So what else is new? Because I know what I saw Scully. There weren't train OK. I'm all ears. What was it? You really believe that story.? A highly classified lie.
You think they'd roll out all of this material for one Maybe. As long as we're here in beautiful downtown Townsend, That gives us 24 hours to investigate. The Last Detail starring Dana Scully Looks like housekeeping hasn't been here yet. SH... Max? Max? Know what? But you don't know me. Last night is the first time Following my career? How? How did you recognize me? I published that under a pseudonym. I didn't think anyone was really paying attention.
Enigmatic Dr. Scully. Fraud. Some unreported weathering effects common to wheat or I try to keep up. Max! You said you had something to show us. What have you got Max? Mrs. Wright? Hi. I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. Why won't you let us help you? What about his wife and child, Doctor? Would you have Excuse me? Dr. Oppenheim. Tell us about the deputy. You saw him Doctor, in your opinion, could those burns have been I've read about these kinds of burns, Scully. I'm talking about close encounter mortalities. I have.
Tell us what happened out there? Wrong colonel. We both want the same thing. Only you Max?
Hey, Max. Max? Hey... Max Max. It's me. Fox Mulder. Are you OK? You were having some kind of seizure. You were lying on the floor. Unconscious. Convulsing. Let's get you to the hospital. Are you sure? And when you have a seizure, you have no memory of it? Rough night, huh? So what do you think, Scully? What's going on out there? I want you to take a look at something first. Max. There's an unusual incision behind his left ear. They're for his epilepsy. You don't seem to understand Scully. Max doesn't believe.
Hey, Max.
Max! Max? What is that, blood? Come on. Think about is Scully. Max is a gypsy. A nomad, right? So he intercepted Deputy Wright's last call to his dispatcher. Max? Max. It's alright. Come on. Come on, Max. I'm here to help you. I know. I won't let them take you. Come on, Max. Come with me. Max! Max! MAX! He's gone. They got to him first. They beat us Colonel. Do you hear that sound Scully?
Hammer.
I'll break a leg. Over a dozen men lost their lives and you want me to Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.
A cover up was underway...
Oh, toxic contamination? Are we back in that? I have further evidence to support my conclusions... The man was abducted. We all know it. Everybody in this Then what can I say?
How can I disprove You can deny all the things I've seen. All the things What did the janitors say? That's not surprising. The security monitors don't have a No sonic boom did this. Well, if somebody would have seen it, Scully, we wouldn't be I saw David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty Yeah. This is Agent Scully. How did she escape? Any idea how she could have escaped a locked cage? I've read about something called the elephant rebellion in zoos So you're saying there were problems? Well, let me ask you something. In your opinion, the Yeah. A local paper. I want to see if David Copperfield's in town. Actually, what we're trying to determine is how Ganesha He said he found the cage locked, the same way he left it. I don't want to belabor this, but a man was found trampled to Who has keys to this lock? Those, uh, chains on the ground there? Disallowed their use by whom? How's your relationship with Ed Meecham? Have you spoken about the incident with Ed? It's the Wild Again Organization - they're a radical group that What do you think Ganesha was running from? This is still going on? Even though Willa Ambrose claims that she's put a stop to I'm sure he would have if he'd seen it coming. Thanks for It's all happening at the zoo, Scully. You think they busted out the elephant? What about all the eyewitness accounts, the security tapes Ah, I'm not buying it, Scully. I think these guys are all talk. No. By doing what? All right. You keep an eye on the W.A.O. Talk to the animals. Did anybody ever tell you the camera loves you, Frohike? Uh, about 150 bucks an hour. Where's Langley? I'm in the town of Fairfield. What do you know about it? Any idea why?
Mulder. All right, I'll be right there, Scully. Scully? You okay, Scully? You calmed down? No, but I looked at the cassette from the kid's recorder. Unless it's trick photography, that kid was killed by some kind I can't explain it either, but I know someone who might be Excuse me? Miss Ambrose? May we have a word with you? Is this where you keep Sophie? You think we could meet her? We're not here to try to take Did you ask her why? What'd she say? It's basic investigative procedure, Agent Scully - interview Are these Sophie's? What do you think they mean? Have you tried to mate her? Do you have a veterinary facility here? All right, this may seem like a rather strange request but it I'm pretty sure of what we're gonna find. And the next thing you know, they'll be doing it on MTV Sports. I've been told there's never been a successful pregnancy at Well, is it true? Why then? But a perfect failure rate? Was an attempt ever made to mate Ganesha? Neither is an invisible elephant. Whatever it is it's been going on for some time, and I think I don't know, but we better find it before Meecham does. I'm sorry. You mean for Sophie? Agent Scully just finished the test. The tiger had been What if they've been artificially inseminated? Unless it was done somewhere else. What do you know about alien abduction? I don't know where they're being taken but there's obviously Yes, and harvesting the embryos. Maybe their own Noah's ark? To preserve the DNA of these I understand that you might think it's ridiculous. Maybe you I believe she's pregnant, and she's afraid of them coming for What'd she say? Can I ask her a question? Will you ask her if she wants to leave here? What did she say? Whatever you do, you can't leave Sophie here. Not if you Where did you get this? It's a small world, after all. Scully, can I talk to you for a second? Why do you say that? Yes. I still am, but in this case, Willa's reactions are all wrong. I think she knows where Sophie is, and Kyle Lang died I think she'd do anything to protect that animal. I think an examination of the body will give us a lot clearer Put it down, Ed. There's been enough violence, don't you Put down the gun and we'll talk about it.
Where is the animal, Ed? Okay. You show me where - we're gonna go there together. What's she doing? She's scared. Okay, Ed. Well, you're going to have to save her. You see her? Hey, Meecham! I'm not gonna hurt you. Where's Sophie? Meecham. They took Sophie. Where's Willa? I got to talk to her. She's gone. It wasn't Ed. She tried to tell me something. What is that? What does it mean? That's her.
Willa Ambrose and Ed Meechum have been.
Oh. Ugh.
I don't know what they did with the screen for this.
Not to mention that these skeletons are not.
That's a pretty big operation you're describing.
There was no.
It's Brown Mountain, Scully.
That doesn't ring a bell?
As I said, there's been no scientific credible.
Sounds like crap when you say it.
I'm just wondering if.
Scully, in six years, how... how often have I been wrong?
We appreciate you holding off.
Hmm.
And they were both found near Brown Mountain, right?
Where.
I'm going to check out where the bodies were found.
Wallace Schiff? Wallace Schiff?
Hello!
Then, come out here.
Step closer.
I won't hurt you.
One of who?
Are you Wallace Schiff?
Well, I hate to tell you.
Who put it there?
The Brown Mountain lights.
Wallace... Wallace?
They found your wife Angela, too... lying.
First things first... we got to find a way out of here.
What the hell's going on?
That was solid rock a minute ago.
Now.
Wallace, let's get out of here.
Come on, Wallace.
Wallace!
They're gone.
They should have.
Maybe they came for something else.
Angie, can you talk to me?
Do you remember what happened?
Can.
You were with your husband.
With Wallace.
Where was that light coming from?
From the mountain?
And then what happened?
This... this place that they took you to can you describe it to me.
Were there men there?
Did they perform tests on you?
You have a, uh... you have a scar back here on the back of your.
It's fresh.
It's an implant.
I've seen this before.
No, male abductees don't usually report this.
And everything she.
Two skeletons we found were identified as yours and Angie's?
I.
I had that thought but there's no precedent for it.
It's in none.
We got to get out of here right now.
We're leaving now.
Gather your things.
Angie, I'll help you up.
No!
Scully...
Long story.
I'm sorry.
Does anybody know you're here?
Scully, this is...
This is my partner, Agent Scully.
Yeah, I think you were meant to.
Scully, I want you to... put aside your scientific bias for a.
I was out there... and I found it.
The truth.
This couple... they were abducted by a UFO... the Brown.
Just like what happened to you.
There's more.
It doesn't like the light.
I abducted him.
It's a gray.
It speaks to me.
We.
Yeah.
You think so?
What about the skeletons?
You're buying that decoy theory?
What about that.
That, uh... doesn't sound like you, Scully.
It, uh... God, I.
Uh, this doesn't make any sense.
These two.
Their story.
Their skeletons.
None of it.
Scully.
We were in the cave when the light came.
It was a blinding.
No, actually, they're not.
Look at me.
I'm here.
Aliens brought me back here.
It doesn't change what happened.
Well, what can I say, Scully?
I'm here. I'm real.
Brought on by what?
Whatever happened to the most logical explanation?
Whoa, Scully.
A giant mushroom?
To lure its prey into the cave?
We've contacted Fish and Wildlife.
We've contacted the North.
I'm just thinking... I'm not exactly clear on how we escaped.
Once you recognized that we were under a chemical.
Scully, how could we simply will ourselves out of a chemical.
Did we?
Can you name me one drug that loses its effect once the.
Scully, how long were we underground?
Hours?
Half a day?
How.
Scully... we never escaped.
We're still trapped underground.
No, I'm not.
This is not real.
You, you're not.
I'll prove it, Scully.
This is an FBI fleet sedan from our Kansas City field office.
Both agents sustained critical injuries.
Their stories eerily.
... as if they temporarily lost control of their minds unable to.
You may think that I'm going to say it's past lives unresolved.
No, the interesting thing about these agents is they had worked.
Yeah, but they are not... romantically involved if that's what.
You have any ideas, Scully, any thoughts?
Hmm...
Don't go thinking I'm going to start doing the autopsies.
Mr. Zupanic, it's the FBI.
It's the FBI, Mr. Zupanic.
Open up.
Bert Zupanic?
We're hoping you can help us find the whereabouts of a woman.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really truly doesn't know Betty.
Hey, Scully!
I want you to meet a buddy of mine.
It's Mr. Argyle Saperstein.
Saperstein, excuse me.
This is my partner, Dana Scully.
Not solved it, but I have narrowed down the search for our.
Our mystery woman is indeed involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic.
Well, there's lots to do here, and the barbecue's second to.
Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?
Sholom aleichem.
Did you lose something?
Excuse me.
FBI.
Yes, I'm looking for...
... that girl.
Betty Templeton?
I think we both know why I'm here.
Lulu Pfeiffer.
Hey, Scully.
I found her at Koko's Copy Center.
Yeah.
She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's trying to ruin.
That's exactly what Betty said.
I don't know, Scully.
You're running this show.
No , Sherlock.
Hey, Scully, uh...
where's.
She wouldn't be driving a little blue convertible.
Oh, crap.
Yeah.
Seeing a side of Kansas City few men have the.
I got sucked into a storm drain.
The more pressing.
You've located him?
And he's given you insight?
Not as angry as those two women are going to be.
Yeah, they're both in love with him.
That's why.
Look, Scully, I don't know.
You're the one who's.
Betty Templeton.
My name is Fox Mulder.
I'm with the FBI.
Don't make me have to remove you, ma'am.
Mm-hmm.
Mmmm. Well, that's one of the luxuries of hunting down aliens and What? That's weird. I'm sure I locked it. I told you I locked the door. Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.
It's an old friend. For what? I'll try to remember that. No, actually. It's one of the few things you didn't drive a Dana Scully, this is Phoebe Green, terror of Scotland Yard. What brings you to the colonies? Your car bomber? The Irish Republican Army? You think he's that determined? So what brings you on this detour to Washington, D.C., Inspector? I'll run it by our arson specialist. That's, uh, from Sherlock Holmes. It's a private joke. Um... we knew each other in school in England. She was brilliant That was over ten years ago, Scully. Oh, I was merely extending her a professional courtesy. Look, I'm going to run this by the arson guys and then she's How's that? But there have been cases of pyrokinetics, people who can control I'm afraid so, Watson. But you're off the hook on this one. I mean I'm not going to put you through this. Phoebe's little mindgame. There's something else I haven't told you about myself, Scully. This is classic Phoebe Green. Mindgame player extraordinaire. Phoebe is fire. Sooner or later, a man's got to face his demons. I pulled this report off the wire last night. Eyewitnesses are The bar's across the street from the fire station. It burned Miss Kotchek? I'm Special Agent Mulder from the F.B.I. This is Inspector Green. Long hair, short hair? Do you think you could work with a composite artist and come Can I get your full name and address? That's no problem. You can come down to the field office and It's a technique I refined in my relationship with you. I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot. I don't want to dredge up Look, Phoebe, I... I'm cursed with a photographic memory. Like I said, just stick to the case. I would agree with you but they haven't found a body yet. Remember those reports I told you about, about people who could I think this guy just sent us a message that he's far more exotic. I'm just not used to someone so quick to agree with me. What kind of protection does the family have? Well, he should look into getting a few additional men and limit Unless you wanted to set a trap. Thanks. Mulder. I'm in Boston. What have you got? Yeah, yeah... No, it's just that I'm, I'm kind of anticipating having my hands Good food, witty conversation. I'm having the time of my life. It doesn't look like your arsonist is going to make an appearance. What? Where's Phoebe? How about the kids? I panicked. I couldn't move, Scully. Yeah, but it happened to me. I hared out. Plain and simple. Hey. How are the kids? To the cape? And you? Right. Yeah. Yeah. And? What did you find on him? So he's clean. Where else did you find him? Call the local field office in Boston of the F.B.I. and get I'm going to try and catch Phoebe, this guy could be waiting His name is Cecil L'Ively. Your arsonist. Where's the rest of the family? Well, go find them. We've got to get them packed and get them I know. He disappeared. Nothing, um... I found this out in the garage. Michael? Jimmie? Everybody out! I think he rigged the whole house. It's fuel. Scully, see if you can find a fire extinguisher. Everybody else, I'll take care of the children. Go! Oh yeah. I'll be fine. There's no place I'd rather be. Michael? Jimmie? Don't move! You have no idea. I don't know. No. She did messenger this to me last night though. No. Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it. It's no mean claim. And you think his luck just ran out? Whoa! What the hell is that? Why weren't you up there? Do you think he's responsible for what happened?
We're not exactly proper channels.
Scully? I don't think it's a good idea for you to go. Well, maybe you should take some time off. We'll look around out here after we've checked inside. Hello? Looks like somebody wanted to put this operation permanently He just about took my head off! Well, who the hell are you? You always greet people this way? Well, who did you think I was that you thought you had to No, we're with the FBI. After we've investigated what happened here. Did he kill Erikson?
Scully? What do you make of Mr. Trepkos' neighborhood? Don't you think their behavior is a little bizarre, almost They're practically climbing the walls in there. No, there's more than that... something they're not telling us. Based on when Ludwig tried to play tee-ball with my head. Pierce knows these people. Let's find out what he thinks.
We can't leave, Scully. Not yet. Trepkos is still out there. I've been going over Trepkos' work, fragments mostly but I An unknown organism, existing within the volcano.
What does this say? Doesn't that suggest a silicon-based life form? Yes, but silicon is the closest element to carbon. It reacts Trepkos said he had physical evidence. Maybe it wasn't Trepkos who destroyed it. What caused that tremor?
You feeling alright? You know, Agent Scully is a medical doctor. Why don't you just let her take a look... I'll go get Scully. He just collapsed after the tremor. He seems pretty bad. What is it? What about Trepkos? We can't just leave him.
Got him? Tanaka! Don't go down there! Don't go down there! So what is it, Scully? What are we dealing with? I'll take any theory you've got. Anything you recognize? What am I looking at here? That would account for the sand in his lungs. Silicon dioxide, the waste product of a silicon-based organism. Come on, Scully, how else do you explain the sand in his He discovered the spore in the samples Firewalker brought up. Not if what he discovered was too disturbing even for him to.
Search and Rescue, this is Agent Mulder.
Please notify FBI District Headquarters in Spokane.
Tell them it's a biological agent... I'm going to go find Trepkos. Then he'll have a tough time answering my questions. Then I have to find out why.
No. You have to finish the autopsy on Tanaka. Hopefully, that will.
I could use a little help. Directions, contour map, USGS survey, anything that can Firewalker. They were transmitted right before Trepkos Well, how will I find them?
A guide. Well, why are you so eager to help me find him? Whatever I'm smelling, is it toxic? How far does the cave extend? Why are you doing this, Trepkos? He's already dead. What went wrong, Trepkos? Firewalker carried something What about you? What do you say it is? Like the spore? I'm Special Agent Mulder. I'm with the FBI. I came down here to investigate Erikson's death. I just want to know what happened after the first descent. Erikson released the spore? What about Erikson? If he was infected... What do you mean? But you weren't infected? You destroyed your work, the transmitting equipment, What about O'Neil? Was she exposed to the spore? I have a colleague - a friend - who's with O'Neil right now. Then you're going to have to shoot me.
Scully! Scully! Are you all right? Erikson was the original host. When the fungus shed its.
Search and Rescue, this is Agent Mulder.
We have two survivors, Agent Scully and myself. It's all over, Scully. He won't talk.
Scully and I are in the third day of a month-long.
Of the members of the Firewalker.
Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.
We're expected.
Cool.
First Person Shooter.
Digital entertainment.
Scully?
Uh-huh.
Cash or stock options?
I don't know about you guys but I'd be checking my shorts.
Who was he playing against?
Did anybody see what happened?
You said you were in the control booth when it.
What happened in there?
What about the wireframe?
Can you texture wrap her?
That ain't all she's packing.
Can you print that out for me?
Scully.
Yeah, our killer, I believe.
It's all in the computer.
But she's not in any video game, she's in this one and no one.
The O.G.... Original Guru.
That's Daryl.
Huh?
Is that him?
Is that Daryl Musashi?
Why is he just standing there?
He hasn't even broken a sweat.
She cut off his hands.
No luck?
Virtual death.
Yeah.
I've got a birthday coming up.
You have to admit, though, Scully.
Stupid?
Who says it adds to it?
Well, that's rather sexist, isn't it?
I mean, maybe the game provides an outlet for certain impulses.
Well, testosterone frenzy or no the only suspect we have in this.
A flintlock pistol....
which would leave a very large entry wound.
As do swords.
The world-renowned Darryl Musashi.
Mulder.... You're kidding.
Thanks.
Afterglow.
That you murdered two men.
One with a 14th century broadsword.
Are you denying that this is you?
We're very sorry, Miss Afterglow but, um... We're sorry.
I don't know about you, Scully, but I am feeling the great need.
Anybody here?
What are they doing?
The Lone Gunmen are on the floor.
What just happened?
They're in the game.
They need help.
Bring it on.
You guys okay?
Okay, on the count of three I'm going to lay down some cover for.
Put the sword down.
Frohike?!
Langly?!
Byers?!
Hey!
I bet you think you're going to kick my butt up and down the.
Okay.
Whoa!
Stop right there!
That's not really fair, is it?
Well, that's just cheating.
Ask me if I'm humiliated.
That's entertainment!
We came, we saw, we conquered.
And if the taste of victory is Why can't the Chicago field office take care.
Because the manifesto.
Monsters. I'm I must've done something to piss him off. Get stuck with this jerk-off assignment or Not yours, anyway. There's no reason I'm monster boy, right? You recognize the voice? Your company had a violent incident in its May I borrow the tape? Well, it's best to err on the side of caution. Use you best judgement. I'll be in touch.
Hi. It's me.
It's a phrase, Hiding in.
Yes, and I didn't say that.
I'm not sure, but I appreciate.
Mulder.
What was he describing?
He was trying to warn them?
Scully, at the risk of you Hello. hello? Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus, Gary? I'd really like My name is Mulder. Applying for a job. I get that. Why should we be afraid Gary, I want to believe that you're protecting Gary! It's just my cell phone. Let me get It's not an it, Gary. It's a he. Answer the phone, Gary. No, Gary. Don't do this. Don't do this, Gary. Put down the rifle. No, I'm fine. Do you have any idea why he fixated on you You mentioned another incident with another Were you at that plant at that time? What about Lakeland, Florida. Have you.
I don't know. Close the door. There was a reason the Seven cities in all dating back ten years. What if Gary Lambert was right? Just bear with me for a moment. What What if it could induce a visual hallucination – a sort Only Gary Lambert could see through it somehow, Yeah, but did he see it because he was disturbed, I saw it, too. Folie A Deux? It's not that, Scully. Lambert pointed out certain individuals he Scully, if this is all in my mind I would Then I'll prove it without you. I'll know it when I see it. Lambert was tracking his boss's movements Gathering evidence. Did you see her? You see where she went?
You got to her, too, didn't I was too late. You changed her somehow. You don't see what's going on here.
Lambert knew your secret. Look at it!
Look at it! Look at Five years together, Scully. You must More or less? What is that supposed Or, that Lambert was telling the truth and Scully. When that monster, Pincus – whatever the.
You have to be willing Scully, you have to believe me. Nobody.
We can do without these, Nurse. Nurse! Nurse! It's.
There is something Undo my straps so I can check. No, don't! No! Just please...! Okay. Just, uh... just untie me anyway What are you doing?
Help! Somebody help! Help! Help! Help! What did you tell him? Which is? My name is Fox Mulder. In the 1990s, I began investigating paranormal science cases through a unit of the FBI known as The X-Files. My partner in this pursuit was Agent Dana Scully, a medical doctor and scientist. In 2001, we had a child together...... but had to put him up for adoption to hide him from those who wished him harm. In 2002 the FBI closed The X-Files. 14 years later, circumstances have arisen which demand new X-Files investigations... Are you saying you have alien DNA?
...bringing Scully and I back together. What do you make of this, Scully? Noted. I mean the room. He chose the most secure place in the building to kill himself. He was trying to access something. These are isolated servers, so, the only way to get to the data is through this terminal, which is also protected. This is evidence. We need to conduct a few more interviews then, before we conclude our investigation. We'd like to talk to Augustus Goldman. Well, if you won't let me look at the drive, then I have to talk to Goldman about what the deceased was trying to access before he died.
Oh, we are finished.. We are finished. You know me, Scully. I'm old-school. That's for a suspect. Sanjay's the victim. Well, then, I'm sure he won't mind me talking to some of his friends. Here's someone he talked to every night. Gupta.
How do you know that? Gupta?
Thanks for meeting me. My name is... Not yet. I want to talk. Can we go somewhere more private? I'm safe. You can trust me. Oh, whoa, whoa, no. Yes. I... I don't think that means exactly what you think it means. Or... or I'm not... Yeah, I've-I've heard something like that. Hey, listen, I gotta tell you...
Sanjay is dead. Did he talk to you about his problems? About work? His kids? He was single. Well, I saw where he lived. There was nothing there. He lived an antiseptic life. Excuse me. Yeah. Founder's Mutation. I don't think that's the mutation Sanjay was referring to. Did you find anything else on the autopsy? It's weird, because the opener goes in at 90 degrees and then it veers off at 60 degrees up into his brain, like he was... hunting for something. Hmm. Well, ultimately, hearing is just nerve impulses interpreted by the brain. What if those same impulses could be generated without actual vibrations striking the eardrum? Well, anyway. If he left a note on his hand, maybe he left other clues. Well, he leased a place that only Gupta knew about. I think we should go to where he actually lived. Being gay wasn't his only secret. His kids? Sanjay was afraid they were dying. These kids, they look so young. None of them look older than ten. Look at the backgrounds. All right, look around. He's bound to have kept some information on them somewhere. Well, I've had a look at them. Those files are the medical records of children with grave genetic abnormalities. How those children relate to Dr. Sanjay's suicide is the object of our investigation.
I'm familiar with Edward Snowden. I managed some top sheets before the DoD took over. I think those children are failed experiments. I don't. Surveillance footage? I heard sounds. It was a high-pitched frequency, like - like a steel spike being driven through my head. And then it focused into two words.
Find her. Look at those birds. Infrasounds, Scully. Vibrations inaudible to the human ear but known to drive the worms up through the soil to the surface, in response to them. Augustus Goldman is the only one who might know how it all fits together. We gotta talk to him.
What are you hiding? When has that ever stopped us before? Obamacare. Ask Dr. Goldman if he'll talk to us about the Founder's Mutation. What's your name? Sick? If you ever want to talk. Sister Mary, how are the patients chosen to be here? It's insidious, Scully. A ward for pregnant women paid for by Augustus Goldman, the founder of a company with deep ties to the Department of Defense. This could be another phase of the project - their experiments in eugenics. Those women in there... could be incubators. Scully... You're never just anything to me, Scully. Yes, of course I do, but I've... I feel like I've had to put that behind me. You did what you did to keep him safe. His adoption is secret, his location is unknown because you had to protect him. I don't know. All we can do, Scully, is pull the thread. See what it unravels. It's what Sanjay wrote on his hand. Interesting. Something's happened to Agnes.
The baby's gone. Hmm? What about the baby? What if the baby was still alive? Unlikely for human foetuses. In 1973, the Syndicate was convened to assist in a project to colonize the world by creating alien human hybrids. The project was ultimately unsuccessful. I doubt they ever stopped trying. Every new species begins with a Founder's Mutation. One child with the correct combination of DNA could be a start. I did some digging around the police archives, looking for anything related to Goldman. 17 years ago, Jackie Goldman was remanded to St. Elizabeth's hospital as a forensics patient. She was adjudicated criminally insane. She was convicted of murdering her baby. That body also was never found. Mrs. Goldman, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband.
About his work? You don't like cats? Do you miss your daughter? They? She heard a tone in her head, a screech. That's what happened to me. Wouldn't be a baby anymore... Excuse me. Uh, er, you don't work for the hospital, do you? You're a subcontractor? Thank you. Thanks. A-1 Janitorial also services Nugenics. You'll recognize the uniform. He's cleaning the office directly above the secured servers vault. He's no more than 15 feet away from Dr. Sanjay at the time of his death. I made a request for the name of the janitor on duty. Turns out he also worked at St. Elizabeth's last month. High school dropout Kyle Gilligan.
We got him. Is he around? We'd like to ask him a few questions about an incident at work. You heard about that. You didn't give birth to Kyle. After the accident, where'd you find him? Your son is unique. Have you ever wondered why? Arghhh! Is that true, Kyle? That you don't know what you're doing? Why did you kill Dr. Sanjay? You made him kill himself. You got inside his head. You got inside my head. You can make people hear things. Like you just did. Like you did to me in Sanjay's apartment. But you can't control it.
At the hospital, where you worked. You heard Jackie's story. Kyle, nobody knows where she is. Kyle! Scully! I blacked out after Goldman's eyes popped out of their sockets. Believe me, you can't unsee that. A trace. Yeah, that's... well, that's early man, William. And that's the monolith. Some people think it represents our first contact with aliens. Other people think it represents the beginning of human knowledge. I... I think one day you'll probably have your own ideas about it.
Hmm?
Oh.
All great and honorable actions are undertaken with great difficulty....
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do other things, not because they are easy... That's right. Okay. There you go. You ready? Five, four, three, two, one. Ignition. William! No! Private John McAlpin... one of the few, the proud... The military is calling it a suicide—They're especially Yeah, except that it's not exactly a base. Flip to the back. A ten year old boy was killed but the uh, details of his They didn't. Mrs. McAlpin contacted the Bureau when.
There. This is the tree that stopped Private McAlpin's car. Most of the refugees at Folkstone are Haitian. Mrs. McAlpin doesn't believe her husband killed himself. Did he believe in voodoo? So, when did you first think that his death involved Who told you that? What about you? How much? I'll give you five. You should always carry protection. Hold on. Colonel Wharton, a, uh... A certain ritual sign was found But you haven't investigated it as a possibility. We understand a refugee was killed... a young boy. Who would that be? Do you think we could speak with him? You're Harry Dunham. You knew Private McAlpin? Any idea why he might have killed himself? You can't say or you won't say? My name is Mulder. I'm with the FBI. I was hoping I'm not convinced it's as simple as that. You tell me. These photographs were taken at the sites Just the truth. One of the Marines left behind a wife. Colonel Wharton says you incited the riot last month. Does that mean you would kill to preserve it? Come on, Scully. Let's go. So what do you think happened to Private McAlpin? It's quite a trick considering he's been confined for the But you said there was no trace evidence. Well, just in case, I believe in covering my bases. Scully, look out! Hey... It's a plausible diagnosis. Only I'm more interested in Did you get a copy of the blood test? Somehow, I get the feeling Private McAlpin didn't What do you know about zombies? In 1982, a Harvard ethnobotanist named Wade Davis But in small enough doses it can cause paralysis and Exactly. Which is what makes me wonder about the.
Yeah. We've arranged to exhume the These body snatchers... What do they do with the bodies? To who? Let us take care of this. Maybe you can tell us. What about a name? What do you do with the frogs, Chester? From who? Who pays you for them? Hey, Chester. I got magic, too, and I bet I can make.
I didn't want to say Out of the car, Private. You've been following us. You didn't seem too interested in helping us before. Chester? He's just a little boy. Private Dunham was just about to tell us why we're in But you do? Unless what? You said that Bauvais threatened the Colonel's men. You believe he can do that? Till I can figure out why he'd lie, yeah. Why would he be trying to avoid Chester? Chester? Chester? Chester! Chester! Stop! I'm not going to hurt you!
That's all right. We already ate. That's right. His body was missing... stolen from his coffin apparently. Well, we'll let you finish. Wharton's left these people no choice but to fight back Not according to Private Dunham. What?
Let me see that. I was surprised to get your card. I had assumed our last I've got a renegade Marine who may be violating every What about Scully and me?
They're making the camp invisible. Why? Why hold them up? Why not just repatriate them? You're saying the military's sanctioning Wharton's revenge? Scully? I found him wandering around outside. You all right? When I found him. He had this in his hand. Do you recall leaving the hospital? Do you remember killing Private Dunham? Colonel... Can we have a word outside? What exactly did you tell him? I need to know that he signed that confession voluntarily? Since his... reappearance has Private McAlpin had any Well, we'd still like to speak with Beauvais. Why? What's wrong?
Mulder........ Okay, Mrs. McAlpin. Mrs. McAlpin, you said on the telephone that Private For what reason? When in Rome... Scully.... Look at this. Where's Wharton? He killed Beauvais. If you know anything about it you'll If you don't believe us, look in the trunk.
This is what's left of Private What is it, Scully? You don't look all right. Federal Agent! Drop the knife, Wharton. Drop the knife! Ah!!! You're okay? I don't know. No. It was Beauvais. Too bad it has to be in a box. Thanks for the call. Five deaths. Four in the last six weeks between here All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest. The oldest drug, not even illegal. Each body showed the Radar love. Only about a hundred times stronger than found It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations I don't know. But if it's true, then this guy is a walking I know. That is a puzzle. It gets weirder. As I said, there's been four deaths There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery. The white clay in those hills is particular to that region. Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to Excuse me, ma'am, this is federal Agent Scully, What can you tell me about the Kindred? They keep What about the missing ones? Can I take a look at them? How would I get up to see them? Excuse me. Ladies? Scully, what are you doing? You all right? You want to sit down? Interesting way of life. You get any sense about them? Oh, I've been saying that for years. Oh, for a 4-wheel drive. Looks like about a mile walk. Now... this... that's west.
That we should be there already. I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. We're here to We can't do that. I was wondering if we might ask a few questions. If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape, maybe Five murders, so far. Has anyone left here recently? That's all right. We didn't take any offense. Thanks for your cooperation. The Addams family finds religion. You believe all that back there, Scully? All that we take care of our own business? I think it was all an elaborate act. No, all this simple life, living from abundance crap. Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single You want to know what was really odd? You know those Maybe. Maybe not everything is as black and white as it I'm going to go back for a little look-see. Maybe they went to the movies. Do you hear that? I think I want to see what's in that cellar.
Scully...
Scully? Get off of her! What the hell were you doing back there? You don't know? You all right? How you feeling? Why? You don't remember any of it. Why didn't you get out of there before he... How did you know he wasn't the killer? Just Brother what's-his-name buried in some gopher Because I was in there with him. And his face was... That would explain the hotel security video. I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you about to do Maybe it's the sex that kills. I don't know. What do you remember? Try to remember, Michael. The policeman at the scene Absolutely. Scout's honor. I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the Delivery!
FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down! Scully?
Scully. Down the stairs... Scully! No earthly means of transportation. Hey Scully, it's me. Sorry to interrupt your dinner. Well, I need your help on something. I was just contacted by About something he found on a mountain in Canada. I'd rather not talk about it the phone, I just need you to meet Right away. Bill, who leaves the kitchen with You're going to have to apologize for me to your brother and He's a forensic anthropathologist that I've been in contact I'm not going to tell you. I'm going to let you decide for yourself. Perfectly intact. That doesn't make sense. There should be signs of gradation. Does that fit geologically? Who all knows about this? If you're going to go, why not go all the way? Qualitatively indefensible. You go public with this nobody is And what do you want? You think it's foolish? You have no opinion? What's that supposed to mean? What about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny? This is not some If someone could prove to you the existence of God, would it Then you accept the possibility the belief in God is a lie? But what if it could be? Wouldn't that knowledge be worth seeking? Can you at least take a look at those core samples? Tell me I thought you said there was someone meeting us. Funny place to take a nap. It's the man who He's been shot. He's our guide?
They had radio communication. Maybe it was being monitored. Get him some water. Looks like he took a shotgun hit, but it We won't know for sure until we do a carbon dating test. The Piltdown Man Hoax wasn't uncovered for forty years until Mulder... So you're saying this has all been orchestrated? A hoax? You come by this knowledge how? And just by chance, you run into Agent Scully? Why come to me now? Why not four years ago? And the thousands of UFO sightings? Evidence of alien biology? The body that was found? They would have known that the body would be carbon dated, that What do you mean?
This man is a liar. Ah... Arlinsky's dead. What we had here was proof, Scully, there's no way it could Yeah, but, the ice core samples checked out. If the ice hasn't Do we know for sure that those cells are not extraterrestrial? Facts overwhelmed by the lies created to support them! After all I've seen and experienced, I refuse to believe that What the hell did that guy say to you, that you believe his.
Jerry? Jerry and I worked together in Violent Crimes. So, Jerry, what are you doing here? Look, Jerry. I'd like to help you out, but we're not on You won't drop the ball. Yeah, but Jerry... I'm a pain in the ass to work with. I'm not a pain in the ass? We had different career I was gunning for a basement office with no heat or windows. He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta working hate crimes. He misplaced a piece of evidence, bagged and everything. Uh-huh. How do you like that? A politically correct elevator. You okay? The, uh, servo switch. Could it have been moved manually? If somebody wanted to override the COS, what would they...? Well, we're going to need a list of all the people with that Would you be on it? What about the phone lines? Does the COS monitor all phone I was just wondering. Phone's off the hook.
Maybe Drake Come in. I'm just looking for my profile notes. They were right here. I'm telling you.
Forget it, no. Jerry, what the hell are you doing? Jerry, that was my profile. Jerry, you went into my office and you stole my work. He apologized - in his own way. One name? Brad Wilczek? That just seems too obvious. To kill Drake would be so Fully.
So this is what a 220 IQ and a $400 million severance settlement That's from the Greek, isn't it? Um, I learn things. Mr. Wilczek, is this system related to the one in your corporate In your opinion, how many people know the system well enough Could someone have hacked into the system?
Will you give me a second? All you had to do was ask. I would've helped you with What what's like? Yea... That was bad luck. That could have happened to anybody. Don't run yourself down, Jerry. You're a good agent. That's not how it was. I'm saying that both voices are Brad Wilczek's. He may I'll go with you. All right. I don't think Wilczek did it. It doesn't make sense. Why would he go back to Eurisko? If you were going to destroy evidence, would you pose for the I think Wilczek is smarter than this.
Yeah, I know.
I ordered the subpoena. What are you talking about? Thanks for coming. I need to know why Brad Wilczek is the subject of a code five Software. What kind of software? I thought it was only theoretical. An adaptive network? I want you to tell me why you're willing to spend the rest of I know you're innocent. You're protecting a machine... Then what? Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions but he never denied But your machine killed Drake. And it killed my friend. And you talk about morality. You're afraid of the government What about a third option. You created that machine. Now you Wilczek can create a virus that will destroy the system. But it's the only thing that makes sense. The COS project Self-preservation. It's the primary instinct of all sentient Then why was our government trying to usurp Wilczek's research? You're probably right.
To talk to someone.
How much time do you need? Scully, what are you doing here? It's the machine. You remember the Trojan Horse?
Open, Sesame!
Oh, what the - - So much for the element of surprise. What do you say we 28 down, one to go.
Trick or treat. No!
I don't want to make the same mistake Drake made..
What are you looking at? There should be a way for you to drop down and open the door.
Come on, Scully. Scully?
Where's the B port? Damn. Now I can put in the virus. Defense Department? Don't listen to him. The machine's a monster, Scully. It's already killed two I checked with Congressman Klebanon and the Department of Corrections They can't just take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation. Where is he? Wilczek won't deal. He'll never work for them. What else could I have done? The Department of Defense still hasn't found anything?
He's an unemployed painter, divorced, You thought all they produced were great hockey players. Well, according to the ME there was no evidence of any Or individuals, if you count the spirit Mostow says That was the operational opinion until last night... When a 19 year old male was found dead six miles from Well, according to Assistant Director Skinner, who asked Cuz he's been working. Haven't you, John? What is it? What is this thing? Does it have a name? What do you call it? Satan? The devil? Scully, this is Bill Patterson. He runs the investigative That's what always amazed me about you, Bill. You think he's got an accomplice then. Even though your What about these drawings of Mostow's? The gargoyles? I didn't get a chance to... Well, that would make sense. Historically, that's what I was asked to look into this case. If you've got a problem Patterson never liked me. Not by Patterson. Didn't want to get my knees dirty. Couldn't quite cast myself in the role of the dutiful student. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah, Patterson had this thing about wanting to track a This guy is definitely some kind of monster. It's just a cat... No. He obviously has his own key to the place. There's air coming through here. There could be something I've got some light. More gargoyles, Scully. Lots of them. Sculpted in clay. The name is from the French gargouille. The name of a I'm not sure yet. I have a few theories. I'm just trying to stitch them together You said it yourself. If you want to know the artist, look Maybe you can also tell me why this man was compelled He said that this thing wants to see his own reflection. Unless he's telling the truth. Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you by not It was turned off. I was working. This thing exists, Scully. It's real. Whatever keeps killing those young men. Whoever attacked me wasn't a person. What makes you think I'd want to see that? Patterson? Why didn't it kill me like it killed the others? Then help me understand, John. No... You have to help me go deeper. You have to help It wants to kill innocent young men by carving up their faces? Unless I find it... Just tell me how to find it, John. Just tell me how to find this thing. Scully? I'm at Mostow's studio. No. Should I be? I'm not sure. What makes you say that? When? Yeah. I examined Mostow's knife yesterday in the evidence Because I wanted to hold it. Look... Scully, I didn't take it. Yeah. What are you doing here? It's Nemhauser. But you already knew that, didn't you? Not me. Not now. Not until you tell me what you're doing here. Look at your hands. Now ask yourself what you're doing here. You're here because John Mostow stole three years of Scully, get that light off me! You don't understand! It's him, Scully. This is Agent Mulder FBI. We work in the dark. We do what we can to battle the evil But if a man's character is his fate, it's not a choice but a Eleventh time, actually. There were three in Seattle, Lucky? That's an interesting word for it. You got any leads on this case, Detective? You got anybody that can read or speak Chinese? Will you get him? I want to see if he can, uh, read this Hi. There's something written up here on the ceiling. Ghost? I don't know, but it's something strange for a man being What's this? Does anybody recognize this? Is it worth anything? Where would I get this... Hell Money? That's good. Maybe we just found a way to identify the body. How many dishes do you have to break before your boss Why would he write the character for ghost on the inside What about the guard seeing three figures that seemed to Who you gonna call? Ghosts or ancestral spirits have Well that would sure teach him to respect his elders, What does it say? Can you copy it down for me?
Talk about tacky. What's that smell?
Looks like they saved.
Looks like Mr. Lo could have Let's get this blood tested. What had the victim been using? Ask her if she knows he's dead. Ask her if she recognizes those characters that were Haunted? You mean by ghosts? You think these murders could be related? Is this a newly dug plot? Chinese? Something just occurred to me. What did you find? What was wrong with him? Nothing? What do you mean? Depends on the body.
You're saying that this guy was selling his body parts for He won't be cashing any social security checks any time Scully, even if you're right, it doesn't figure. There's no.
Well, we're gonna need more help No. What's this? How long have you lived in this country, Mr. Hsin? You live here alone? Thank you, Mr. Hsin. If we need you, we'll get back to you.
I'll tell you in a minute. What was that about?
Do you know what it says? Wood? He's missing his eye and I'd like to know how he lost it. I doubt they're to the ophthalmologist, though.
No, I'm just a little tired, jumpy. One more string No, but I'm glad you're here ‘cause I was just about to go What do you mean? Who cut him? Did anybody see him get up? Can I see his chart? Yeah. I want to see what his blood type was. Why would he run? Maybe all this heel dragging's a diversion. That ghost Glen Chao, O-negative. Well, that's a coincidence. And I'd be willing to bet that he's the one who asked for Yeah. That conversation they had wasn't about any What's your father involved in, Kim? Who are these men that come to visit your father?
Do you know what this is? Do you know what it says? I found it... over there by.
They're playing some kind of game. What? Do you have a name or a phone number for this doctor? 311 Porter, right. Hey Scully, look who's here. It's definitely not Chinese food I'm smelling. It smells like rubbing alcohol. What's this? It sounds like it's coming from upstairs. Chao? Hands in the air. Hands in the air! What did he say?
Can I talk to you for a minute? I just got back from St. Francis Hospital. I checked with the donor procurement organization. Yeah. They put up a wall of silence. They all claim to be He was supposed to testify before a grand jury this How do I know you're for real? First I want you to come somewhere with me. I want you to come Stay out of his way, Scully, he doesn't want to hurt you. You Come on. Scully, get the car! Hey! Jeremiah! You can't leave here! I need your help! Who? What can they do? We're working in the light. They, they can't The larger plan? I don't understand... My mother is dying. I need to take you to see her right now. How can I stop it? No, look, there's no time! Scully, it's me. Why? Are you okay, Scully? Listen to me, there's going to be... there's going to be people No, no, no, hold on, just, just listen for a second, Scully. Who? How much further from here? Let's go. What happened to this man? There's a work order here. It's for yesterday. He's only been What is it? Being grown for what? What is this? What's going on here? That looks just like my sister. What do you mean? What are you talking about? How'd they get here? Who takes care of them? They're clones. She's coming with us. Well, then who is she? Well, then explain it to me. Explain it to me now! Are bees what killed that man we found? It's probably not a good idea to hide in there. But you do? Come on! Scully, where are you right now? I'm still in Canada, but I'm catching a plane soon. I need you At the hospital where my mother is. Her life depends upon me and my party getting there safely. Jeremiah Smith... and someone else. What do you mean? They'll get their chance. Please, you can't kill him...he can't die. That girl is my sister. Kill me, let them go. For my mother's. I can't... there's nothing. She'll never know. I could have saved her, Scully. I had one chance... and I let it slip away. He took me to a place with green fields. And I saw my sister. You put such faith in your science, Scully. But... the things I feel like I came so close. How? Hi, was he able to review the material that I sent him? And will he see me? A friend. You know, I've been inquiring with each of the special I've suffered... I've suffered some very personal... losses.
Who's Cardinal O'Fallon?
Oh.
I don't want to be myopic here, sir, but this looks like a.
Are you going to answer your phone?
Yeah.
Sir, who the hell is this guy?
Well, that's actually just a hindrance-slash-pain in the neck.
I've no idea what you just said.
Sir, have I pissed you off in a way that's more than normal?
Enough, Wayne.
Cardinal O'Fallon can you think of anyone who might make an.
The size of the bomb would have limited its destruction to just.
Wayne, shut up.
Wayne... Shut up.
Who comes down to the crypt here?
Well, my instinct, Cardinal, is to see this desecration of the.
Excuse me.
That's, uh, that's not me.
No.
That's Micah Hoffman.
Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays, and Frank Serpico.
That's my.
Yeah. Name a '60s counterculture movement and Micah Hoffman.
Yeah, right after Altamont.
He was never really heard from again.
This should be it here.
What did Skinner want you for this morning?
Wow.
I knew, uh, Hoffman was a master potter...
All right, one more pun and I pull out my gun.
Scully, look at.
After?
Well, what would Micah Hoffman be doing with heretical.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
What's that?
Looks like the same gospel of Mary Scully ID'd over at Hoffman's.
Well, there is no real Gospel of Mary, Federman.
The, uh.
Hmm...
Federman, that wasn't a movie.
That was real life.
You're leaving?
You don't want to get to the bottom.
Well, you know, sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction.
Well, why do you say that?
I miss him already.
The Lazarus bowl?
Twisted sisters, my kind of nun, you know?
She'd be in prison today.
You realize that.
Lazarus's aunt?
You see? It's just not true that you can't get good science at.
That is a very cool story coming from you.
Can you translate what it says there for me, please?
Yes.
And how about these?
Or rough drafts.
They're all forgeries, sir.
Did you buy these from Micah Hoffman?
I can understand that.
Hoffman was a master.
My partner.
Can you think of anybody who might have wanted to kill.
Why were you hiding the documents, sir?
So you bought them in order to hide them?
Why didn't you just destroy the documents yourself?
I'd be doing life if it were, sir.
Hey, uh, Scully, it's me.
Can you horn in on the.
I got a feeling Hoffman was dead before he died.
Oh, hold on a second.
That's my other line.
Yeah, Mulder.
I can't really talk about the case, you know.
I'm in the movie?
Yeah, hold on a second, Wayne.
Hey, Sister Spooky, I've got to take this.
Thanks.
How about Richard Gere?
Wayne, you're breaking up.
It sounded like you.
How do you know about the Lazarus bowl?
Hey, who's... well, then who's going to play Skinner.
Ri... Ri....
What'd you find, Scully?
Man, oh, manischewitz... communion wine, I bet.
I bet O'Fallon poisoned Hoffman then placed his body near the.
I could get a warrant for O'Fallon.
Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest for the murder of Micah.
Anything you say can and will be used against you...
Yes, I do.
A bomb went off, a crime's been committed.
There's a dead.
I think this whole Richard Gere thing is going to Skinner's head.
Chuck, I've had a bad day.
What's the second part?
I am become skeptical.
Well, I suppose that's a choice every young gifted American.
At Columbia.
How did your cell phone get on the dead man in the crypt?
It's open.
Couldn't sleep either, huh?
Yeah.
It's the Ed Wood investigative method.
This movie is.
Yeah?
Are you making fun of me?
Well, no, I don't.
But crazy people can be very persuasive.
Are you directing that at me?
Well, you know, even a broken clock is right 730 times a year.
42.
Yes.
You know, Scully, we've got four weeks probation vacation.
Scully...
Nice to meet you.
Big fan.
Fox Mulder.
Hi.
Sure.
What do you...
What do you mean?
Uh...
I guess mostly to the left.
Most of the time.
Mm-hmm.
Hello?
I'm, uh, working at the, uh, computer.
What are you.
You know, Scully, I was just thinking about Lazarus.
Party pooper.
Well, I got a new theory.
I say.
Exactly.
Hold on a second, that's my other line.
Hello?
No, sir, I'm just at the, uh, computer.
Oh.
I appreciate that, Skinman.
Yes, sir.
Um... Uh, where are you now?
A.P. Skinner, huh?
Uh...
So what are you up to right now, sir?
Uh, hold on just one second, sir.
Hey, Scully, Skinman is.
Uh, sir, well, hold on one second, sir.
Scully?
Yeah, Skinner is calling me from a bubble bath.
Totally.
Oh, yeah, right.
Like Tea Leoni's ever going to.
Really?
That's it, Scully, I can't take it anymore.
They got it so wrong, Scully.
It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.
No, no, it's just beginning.
Hoffman and O'Fallon were these.
Yeah, what about us?
How are we going to be remembered.
What about all the dead people who are forever silent and can't.
The dead are everywhere, Scully.
I bet he was...
What's that?
Ah... Me, too. Smell that. Scully, you don't know me as well as you think you do. You know, For real? Hey, Sheriff, who lives in that house there? Well, maybe we should take a look at the victim then. Fife? Well, you could just lock your door to the office. I guess we can rule out murder as the cause of death, huh? There's something rotten in Mayberry. Apparently not much in this case if she just threw it out with Why, is there a history of genetic abnormalities in your family? Well, just find yourself a man with a spotless genetic make-up Hmm? Well, aside from the need for corrective lenses and a tendency We should let local authorities investigate that. Scully, uh, Sheriff Taylor, uh, implied that the boys in that Do we? Yeah, yeah, but there's no sister. The mother's been dead for And kidnapping is a bureau matter. Yeah, if we can find them. They probably bolted when they saw If the mother is alive, they probably took her with them. Whoa! Don't move, don't move. Not if I can't get the Knicks game. Good night, Mom. Oh, you don't have to, uh, lock your doors around here. Big American car. Where are they? His chest is one big hematoma. There's wood shavings embedded You suspected these abnormalities. Triple? What if generations of autosomal breeding could produce such Well, in any case, they haven't ventured too far from home. Yeah, but we're outnumbered. We could further endanger the victim Oh, that was just a little bit too Chuck Bronson for me, Scully. Ah, they probably heard about the warrants issued for their No, we searched the house, Scully, they weren't home. We're getting into position. The eldest will move in to ensure the prey has been killed, Yeah, but we can try and divert them out of the house. Yeah, that'll work. And people call me Spooky. Oh, no. It's alright, ma'am! We're federal agents! We're here to help you! Ma'am. They've got her strapped to some kind of board or something. Ma'am, we're here to help you. Calm down. Ma'am, we're here The others may have heard the screams. I'm going to check on She's not going anywhere. I'm sure she's an accessory. At least she aided and abetted. Which means that when Edmund was a kid, he could ground the Scully! Where's the other brother... Edmund? I looked everywhere, they're both gone. I think time already caught them, Scully. It wouldn't be Philadelphia without a certain degree of confrontation, right?
Have you tried polyvinyl siloxane to try to lift the print? Well, it looks like this person was born without footprints. Which is impossible... by the way.
Not even in the proper recycling bin. When a medieval prisoner was drawn and quartered, it took four horses charging off in four directions at full speed to tear him apart.
Scully? You go. Go. Here are the four mounted security cameras. There's the first one knocked out of position. Then the second one. And the third. And I saw that Cutler's was knocked out. But Cutler's eye-line is trained above the door, about Tim Duncan height. We can eliminate any 76ers, 'cause those guys can't find the rim. Oh. Look at that. The billboard outside Cutler's office. At the time of the murder, there's no artwork on it or graffiti. That street art was put up this morning. After Cutler's murder. Maybe the artist that put it up there is saying something or saw something. I'm gonna see if it's signed or if anybody knows who made it. Hey, Officer? I'm gonna need access to the roof of that building. All right? Special Agent Mulder with the FBI. And who are these two fine representatives of the City of Brotherly Love? Mm-hmm. And you are? And why do you think someone down here killed him? Oh, you guys married?
No? Oh. Douchebag. I thought maybe... Oh.
But? Okay, okay, okay. I hear you speaking for them, but really you're speaking for yourself. And I hear you speaking for them, but really speaking for yourself. What I don't hear is who speaks for them. Band-Aid Nose Man? What is that? That's... the name of the artist? Who is that? You know where I can find him?
I don't know if my being here will help bring you back... but I'm here. Clean? You can confirm that there's no presence of any pathogenic agents? I'm here. There was some artwork displayed outside Cutler's office after the murder. It was of a figure the people on the street believes defends them. The street artist that made the artwork goes by the name Trashman. No-one knows his real name. Stays anonymous. No one's ever seen him. I suspect the subject may be a mission-oriented killer who believes he's helping the homeless by eliminating those involved with the relocation. And I would stay, but I suspect the subject will kill again. Your brother? I invented it. When you were in the hospital, like this. What else is new? Well, her pulse rate quickened, but I didn't see her move. Do you know where you are? Do you know your name? Scully! Scully! No. Margaret's an organ donor. They need her right away. Let her go. No. No, no, no. No, I get it, Scully, I do. But not right now. Federal agents! We're looking for the Trashman. What? I wasn't gonna shoot the kid. And I don't do stairs anymore. Back in the day. Scully, back in the day.
is now. Federal agents! Open up! If you're in danger, we're here to help. You the Trashman? So, what, you took care of the problem? By killing Joseph Cutler and Nancy Huff and those two art thieves? Well, why'd you put up the art after the fact? The morning of Cutler's murder? Him? Who, who is him? Yeah. Tulpa is a 1929 Theosophist mistranslation of the Tibetan word tulku, meaning a manifestation body. There is no idea in Tibetan Buddhism of a thought form or thought as form. And a... and a realized tulku would never harm anyone, let alone kill.
What are you gonna call him? If what you believe is possible, the last person involved in the relocation would be Landry.
Mr. Landry, this is Agent Mulder. I need you to call me back. It's urgent.
I almost gave up on you.
Stakeout.
It's an important date.
Important to why we're here.
Why don't you turn off your car.
Oh.
Look, if you've got Christmas stuff to do I don't want to...
I just thought you'd be more... curious.
No one.
The former occupants.
That's the story.
No. Actually that was a left cheek sneak.
Technically speaking they're called apparitions.
I'll make it fast.
I'll just give you the details.
Christmas, 1917.
It was a time of dark.
But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane for a pair of star-crossed.
His name was Maurice.
He was a... a brooding but heroic.
Driven by a tragic fear of separation they forged a lovers' pact.
And their ghosts haunt this house every Christmas Eve.
I just gave myself chills.
You don't believe in ghosts?
Well... Yeah.
I thought everybody believed in ghosts.
My best to the family.
I'm just going to take a look.
Change your mind?
No.
Why would I take your car keys?
Maybe it was a ghost.
That's a cold wind.
I think the spirits are among us.
Sounds like there's somebody walking around upstairs.
There. You hear that?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Ghosts are benevolent entities.
Mostly.
Shh!
What was that?
Mm-hmm.
Tell me you're not afraid.
I got your back.
No one lives here.
Must have been some kind of electrical surge.
Is it?
Yeah.
Why would anyone want to live in a cursed house?
Every couple that's ever lived here has met a tragic end.
Whoa... There's that sound again.
I think there's a hiding space under the floorboards.
There may be somebody trapped under there.
I got to get them out.
Hey, you have a gun, right?
Rationally, you've been in much.
I was half right.
Hey, Scully...
Look at this.
Yeah.
What?
How embarrassing.
Oh... Scully...
Hey, Scully...
All right.
I'm beginning to... Get this.
I should come out... This door.
Scully!
Scully!
Hey, Scully.
Scully, can you hear me?
Hey!
Who are you?
No.
That's very funny.
Have you looked at the door?
Tell me what you see.
That's a door with a brick wall behind it.
You're playing tricks on me.
Yeah? That's a trick in itself, isn't it?
You've been playing.
Ah, that's very funny coming from a ghost.
Strange folks?
Like those folks under the floorboard.
How did you do that?
There were corpses here... bodies buried under the floorboards.
No.
No.
Wow.
I didn't know such a thing existed.
And what category is that?
That's a category?
I don't think that pegs me exactly.
Because I have seen them?
Paramasturbatory?
All right, now just, uh... Just back off for a second.
I'm not alone.
No, I came here with my partner.
I'd just like to find my partner.
Who are you, now?
I'm trying to get out of this room.
Excuse me.
Frump.
You're a ghost.
What happened to the star-crossed lovers?
It's you.
You're Lyda, and that was Maurice.
To all what?
We came here looking for you.
No.
Why?
What about her?
Yeah.
What experience?
I thought you had a lovers' pact.
Oh...!
Why are you showing it to me?
Oh, you're trying to tell me that Scully's going to shoot me.
I wouldn't shoot her.
I wouldn't let her.
We're not lovers.
Hey, Scully!
Scully?!
Scully... Scully, are you there?!
Open the door, Scully!
Where's Scully?
There's no getting out of here, Scully.
There's no way home.
You going to shoot me?!
It's me or you... You or me. One of us has to do it.
Oh, yes, we do.
Even if we could what's waiting for us?
More loneliness!
Merry Christmas, Scully.
Scully!
Scully?
What did you do?
You didn't believe what?
What are you doing?
Scully?
Scully...
No, you're not...
I am, too.
You should have thought of this.
You shot me first!
Scully...
Get up.
Get up... You're not shot.
Come on.
It's a trick.
It's all in your head.
Come in.
Aren't you supposed to be opening Christmas gifts.
I-it must have been.
When have you proved me wrong?
You didn't want to be there?
Oh, that's, um... That's self-righteous and...
Now, um... I know we said that we weren't going to exchange.
Merry Christmas. Nothing you can ascertain from that photograph. The victim suffered from ichthyosis, a congenital skin disease characterized by the shedding of the epidermis in the form of scales. I can't wait for the wake. On his vicap form, Jerald Glazebrook's occupation is listed as artist. I got the impression that Glazebrook wasn't the only sideshow performer residing here. Sheriff, what is this? This design here, it's, uh, copyrighted by Hepcat Helm. Do you think that we could meet Hep... cat? Mister Helm, I wanted to ask you about this menu illustration. I recognized most of the historical portraits you've drawn here, but what's this here? A monkey? The Feejee Mermaid was a reality. These tracks were found at several of the past few crime scenes. They've defied exact identification but one expert speculated that they might be simian in nature. Tell me, have you done much circus work in your life? I know that many of the citizens here are former circus hands and I just thought that maybe you would have done... I'm sorry, I meant no offense. But I am an F.B.I. agent. Tell me, have you done much circus work in your life? Why'd you give it up? The Feejee Mermaids bite. Every murder investigation begins with a list of possible suspects. You should try not to be so exclusive, Scully. Hey, Scully, there's some blood on the window here we should send to the lab. No, not this window. While they're performing the autopsy, I want to go down to the... We caught your act yesterday at the funeral. That was some trick with the railroad spike. Have you ever performed this tr, uh, act on anyone else? Exactly how does one become a professional blockhead? May I? Oh, I'm doing that as we speak. I could be mistaken. Maybe it was another bald-headed, jigsaw-puzzle-tattooed, naked guy I saw. He eats live animals. Well, I'm going over to the lab to see if they can test the blood on the window against the blood on Doctor Blockhead's nail. Does Agent Scully know that you're under her crawlspace? And you'd be surprised how many men do as well. The blood from the window matched the blood from the nail but they were both O-positive. They've been sent for further analysis. I ran a background check on Doctor Blockhead. His real name is Jeffrey Swaim and he wasn't born in Yemen, he was born in Milwaukee. He does not hold a doctorate. On who? You're talking about Sheriff Hamilton? You know, Scully, hypertrichosis does not connote lycanthropy. We're being highly discriminatory here. Just because a man was once inflicted with excessive hairiness, we've no reason to suspect him of aberrant behavior. Yeah. We're exhuming... your potato. We found out you used to be the Dog-Faced Boy. That doesn't quite explain the potato. Scully, come here! I don't know if a contortionist can get through that doggy-door, Scully, but look at this... We'll take Jeffrey Swaim into custody. Freakish? Who's your lawyer? It's more comfortable than a futon. Does this belong to you? What is that? There's been another attack. What are you talking about? Leonard? But it's an appendage... But, how? H-how... Sheriff, we're going to need the paramedics. I thought I heard a shot fired. The trailer park. Have you seen a, uh... uh... Now you know how I feel. What's the matter with your friend?
Yeah, we'll have it our way.
We're investigating a murder.
A car was found in a reservoir ten.
Yeah, long day.
So let's make this quick.
Yeah, but does everybody have their button?
Hey, uh, you... back there, what's your name?
Derwood. Do you have your button, Derwood?
We're going to ask everybody to step outside right now.
His name was Donald Edward Pankow.
Does that ring a bell?
Hey, Scully, check it out.
You know how they say you.
My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all.
Maybe. Maybe I'm thinking this was the crime scene.
It had to happen somewhere.
I wouldn't exactly call it surgery.
I-it's not sociologically unheard of.
There are certain tribes in.
Yeah, what's your point?
It's just that nothing about the way the body was dumped.
Well, maybe it was cut. Maybe it was punched.
What look.
I don't know.
Oh. Hello.
Look at this.
Does that look like blood to you?
What is that?
Next to it.
Is that, uh... oh, my... ugh.
Ground beef.
Rob Roberts?
It's Agent Mulder.
Hello, again.
Sorry to bother you at home.
Can I come in?
Great, great.
You live here alone?
Uh-huh.
Mom or girlfriend?
Come on, man, who cleans up after you?
Well, bravo. You know, they say single guys are just bears.
Yeah, a cheeseburger and a large order of fries.
Yeah, did you volunteer to close?
Yeah, okay.
You volunteered.
Volunteered...
um...
the, uh... the 35 pounds.
Where?
Hmm.
That's weird.
Because that's what I figured you did.
I don't see how that's relevant to this murder case anyway.
Blood.
Mmm.
I think that just about wraps it up for me here.
Yeah. No, I already got a pretty good idea who it is.
Thanks.
Hey, just the man I wanted to see.
I'm glad I caught you.
Oh, hey, I was just driving to your.
Good. I'd stay away from him.
He's our prime suspect in.
Me? No. No, I should say that's the opinion of the Costa.
No, I think we're looking for somebody who has a compulsion.
The dumpster had a padlock.
Who would have the key?
I'm just tying up some loose ends.
Afternoon, Rob.
His car is gone along with some personal belongings.
Who said he left town?
No, no, no.
Personally, I think he's dead.
I can't speak for my.
I'll let you in on a little secret.
Don't you believe it.
This thing definitely qualifies.
It has a.
Because it can't kill with impunity and it knows it.
It knows.
I think you know why.
Watch out for that monster.
Mr. Derwood Spinks.
Alive and well.
You must have been very scared.
Do you recognize this guy?
He's a private eye.
Sylvia Jassy's ex-husband hired him to.
Well, maybe we should check with Sylvia again.
Well, we'll track her down.
Step away, Rob.
Step away.
Rob, we tracked Sylvia down on the way to the landfill. This team of scientists made up the Arctic Ice Core Project. So far nobody's been able to reach to reach the compound because These were top geophysicists. They were trained and screened Fouts retired in '87, didn't he? Agent Mulder and Agent Scully, you? San Diego? You get much of a chance to study ice down there? Mulder, nice to meet you. Hi. What for?
It's me!
It's you. Something wrong? Yeah. Bear? See if you can get the power started. Before we touch anything, we have to thoroughly document the That's what they were drilling for. Quarter of a million years It's the generator. Yeah, he didn't break the skin. Bear, you okay? What could that mean? Danny? My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos is a little I also found this data and if I'm reading it correctly, the What'd you find? Unless a foreign object was introduced into that environment. Holy... Scully. Unless that's how it lives. If those bodies are infected with an unknown organism, we can't It didn't break the skin - Okay, anyone got the morning sports section handy? You can't go, the dog bit you. We have to. We can't risk infecting the population. Take a vote. Whoever believes we should confine Bear until he Murphy, get a rope! We don't know enough about it! This is the A.I.C.P. Investigative Team calling Doolittle Airfield, This is Agent Mulder, we have a serious biological hazard. Request We were told we would have three clear days of weather, over. Is Bear in any condition to fly? We don't get out in an hour, Have you figured out how it's transmitted yet? Were they all in the spine? You're saying it's possible that the worm makes you want to Maybe they did it to save us. Just some sleep, huh? We're all wired and hypersensitive, it'll be good to get a fresh I don't know if we should kill it. The meteor that crashed here a quarter of a million years ago Exactly. But what do we know about it? This organism might be But if we do kill it now, we may never know how to stop it or Do we have the right to destroy an organism which can provide... How do you know it can't be contained? Let's all just settle down, it's been a long hard day. We're Maybe we should all get some sleep. Before anyone passes judgement, may I remind you we are in the Good night, Scully. Don't forget, the spots on the dog went away. Murphy's dead. I found him like this. I heard one of the doors close, I came I don't have any of the symptoms. It was one of you! What, so he can doctor the results? I'm not gonna let him stick I'm not turning my back on anyone! As far as I'm concerned, Scully, get that gun off me! Put it down! Scully! For God sakes, it's me! In here, I'll be safer than you. It's just you? It's one of them. So? You give me one worm, you'll infect me.
I would have but you pulled a gun on me. Now I So is she. Bastards! No! Scully! Do it! I'm going back to the site. This time, I'm going fully prepared Know what? It's still there, Scully. 200,000 years down in the ice. No. Why'd you call Mufon? You think this grave was unearthed by aliens, Agent Bocks? The literature? I hate to disappoint you, Agent Bocks, but this doesn't look I've seen this kind of thing before. When I was with the Violent He may work here, but it's not likely. Though he's probably If you want to call him that. You okay, Scully? Nothing can prepare you for it. It's almost impossible to imagine. Some people collect salt and pepper shakers. The fetishist Why? I've prepared myself for it before we left Washington. I had suspected as much. How many bodies does this make? What else can you tell me about the analysis of the corpses? Alright, I want you to draft an eyes-only memo to everyone That the Twin Cities have an escalating fetishist on their An escalating fetishist. Security should be tightened around You can leave out the more gruesome aspects in your press release. His compulsion is growing. He may resort to homicide to procure How's that? If you catch this guy before he kills, maybe they can go right I'm going to cancel our flight. We've got some work to do here. Scully? Was it him? Might be a nice week to take that paid vacation the boss owes Until he kills again. Or until we can determine what's driving The hooker was just convenient. This guy's not after sex. He's The next thing to do is call all the psychiatric facilities. Scully, it's me. They've arrested somebody they think may be Who cut him? He's not our guy. Yeah. What are you suggesting? If you're having trouble with this case, Scully, I want you I'd understand, Scully. This isn't exactly easy to stomach. Are you staying on there, Scully? Look, Scully. I know this is a pretty horrific case - Always! No. She was forced off the road, it looks like a white car... get one of your men to get We've got to go back to the beginning. As nasty as it seems, What do you mean? Let's find out. Just stay there, Scully. His Mother used to own the house, willed it to the sisters. Why don't you sit down until someone can take a look at you.
Can I get you some coffee?
Water? Anything?
Morning.
Special Agent Dana Scully, this is, uh, this is Jay Gilmore.
Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri, the Show Me.
It's okay.
Uh, this is Mr. Gilmore's... situation.
This condition came on.
Anson Stokes is a former employee at the, uh, self-storage yard that Mr.
Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore was, uh... stricken...
Stricken... stricken, and Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found.
He.
Well, and to be fair, sir, they didn't... they don't.
I know... this may not be a crime and this guy Stokes may not know.
Yeah, but that takes months to develop, right?
It doesn't just happen in the.
That's a nose, Scully, we're talking mouth here.
Well, maybe, but I still want to know why Anson Stokes doesn't want to.
A little bit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's your name?
Oh, you're Anson's brother?
Hi, there.
We're not here to talk about the boat, Leslie.
We want to talk to your.
Now I see what's going on here.
Well, I don't smell any weird chemical smells.
Hey...
1978.
It's been a long time since any.
Oh, well, you want to hit some yard sales while we're out here?
What's your point?
Like what?
And winds up with the Titanic in his driveway?
That still doesn't explain what happened to Gilmore.
Hey, Scully, check this out.
This woman look familiar to you?
That's the –young- woman from the trailer.
How many centuries now has.
I think you missed a spot here.
I can see straight through to his ass.
This is Anson Stokes, huh?
And he's invisible.
It is amazing, but I don't think it has anything to do with science.
I did a little background checking.
His real name is Henry Flanken.
He.
Chronic morbid tumescence.
Schwing.
On April 4, 1978, he was admitted to Gateway Memorial.
Well, I think our mystery woman is the link.
About whom I can find no.
I... I don't know.
But... we need to talk to her.
Okay.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
No, I don't think he suffered.
The part about him being invisible... that.
Leslie, there was a woman here earlier.
Where is she now?
Uh, let me tell you where I'm going with this.
I think that woman is a.
It's the feminine for jinni... as in a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern.
Yeah, except Barbara Eden never killed anybody.
All right, now in Arabic.
Leslie, I believe your brother found just such an object in the storage.
I do.
And, Leslie, for your own safety... so that what happened to your.
You're doing the right thing.
Hey, Scully, come check this out.
Come on, he's not going anywhere. Come on.
It's not what I hoped it would be.
Judging from the odor coming inside, I.
But that's not what I wanted to show you.
Recognize him?
How about her?
Well, the computer says it is her.
I ran her through Quantico's facial.
Or Richard Nixon, for that matter.
I don't know.
Except that they're both men who got all the power they ever.
You saw it.
It was real.
I don't think that's why the body disappeared.
I think it was the result of a wish being granted.
Well, who would want Anson Stokes back?
I mean, really, really back.
Would you mind removing your eyewear, ma'am?
Ah.
Do you have a name?
How about if I call you Jenn? That's short for jinniyah..
Leslie Stokes and his brother, Anson.
Well, one thing I haven't been able to figure out is whether you're a good.
Well, possibly evil.
Possibly cursed.
A curse to others.
You mean making the wrong wishes.
You been out of circulation a long time.
What was your third wish?
And thus became a jinni yourself.
I get three wishes.
I don't think she knows what to make of you.
I don't think I do either.
Mmmm.
Well...
What would your wish be if you were in my place?
But, I just...
you know, I'd like to know.
You know, I think I'm beginning to see the problem here.
You say that.
This is because they make their wishes solely for personal gain.
So the trick would be to make a wish that's totally altruistic.
That's for.
What the hell's wrong with that?
You can't do it?
Oh, crap.
I guess I should have seen this coming!
Scully.
Scully?
Hello?
Hello?
Very good.
Jinni?
Jinni, whatever the hell your.
What the hell is this?
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
This has nothing to do with specificity.
You don't have to wipe out the.
Did I say that?
I didn't say that.
Yes, I do, since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely.
And.
But we're not all that stupid.
We're not all chimpanzees with revolvers.
I.
Sir.
Uh...
Well, I have to be with you.
I'm going to get this last wish perfect.
I'm not.
You don't remember disappearing off the face of the earth for about an hour.
Well, I guess everything's okay.
Boink!
Scully, it is what it is.
You examined an invisible body, remember?
Oh!
The trick is to be specific.
To make the wish perfect.
That way, everyone.
Then what's the problem?
Yeah, I'm ready.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
Uggh. It's un-.
It's a classic American movie.
Okay, when you invite me over to your place we can watch Steel.
I don't know.
Just felt like the thing to do.
Cheers.
I don't know if you noticed but, um, I never made the world a happier place. You don't sound so sure of that. Would you be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that Well, that's too bad. Because the next rape you experience will Are you having trouble sleeping? Are you experiencing muscle The description of the aliens, the physical exam, the mindscan, Yeah, if it were only one person, Scully, but we have two individuals You still going to hold the boy? But the victim seems to confirm his alibi. How did the alien respond? What was the other alien, the gray, what was it doing during Telepathically? Because the other alien was conducting torturous experiments Then what? He said it happened before the abduction. So what if they had So you're saying that all this is just a case of sexual trauma? Why don't you tell us what happened that night? Why is that? What did these men look like? All in black? Since the '50s, people who have had close encounters have reported If we have any more questions, where can we find you?  I sat in my stalled truck, frozen in terror, watching as this ...thee. Before I knew it, I was aboard the hover vessel and I'm not saying he isn't delusional, I'm just suggesting that I'm going to arrange to have her re-hypnotized. To see if what she remembers is really what she remembers. Air Force? No, I think you're wrong about that, Scully. But I do think Hey! Does that video camera work? I don't know, but I bet we can find his I.D. from the, uh, military That was fast. Who notified you? Possible kidnapping. No, no, no, but you can talk to the other AWOL pilot that was That's right. Yeah, he's, he's, he's right down... I got to find that video guy. Where's the tape? Who? If I find out you lied to me, you're a dead man. Lieutenant Jack Schaffer? Or on visitors from outer space? They experience missing time. But abductions? But what do you do with the abductees? Hypnosis. But if abductions are just a covert intelligence operation and What do you mean? I can only assure you that I do. Wait a minute, wait a minute. It can't all be fake memory implantations. Sweet potato pie. You ever seen a UFO in these parts? You ever experienced a period of missing time? Scully? Where is she?! Similar things are said about the men in black. That they purposely I told you, you didn't let me in. They were already here. They don't want assistance. They want witnesses to their alibi. Thanks. Don't write this book. What's that? How the hell should I know? It's an area also known for its history of racial tensions and Where? Has he been arrested? Very Old Testament. Interesting how? Risen from the grave to avenge his own death? But you have your own idea. A resurrection hoax. Yes, spectral figures are not often known to leave So there was a specific threat of violence? We would be happy not to disturb the grave site if you Maybe......but it's hard to fault his attitude when you see something I'm not saying those kids deserve full prosecution under I bet whoever published that knows the boys who murdered Why is that? Can you think of anyone who held a grudge? Did you? Are you familiar with this? Who? A Jew pulled it off 2000 years ago. Bless you. Yeah, second set of footprints, but the mud is too soft Looking for what? That seems kind of redundant, doesn't it? Messing up Afraid that man they hated enough to kill wasn't really dead. Look, there goes your theory of how Isaac's fingerprints got What's this?
A little bedtime reading? FIRE! Have they ever been known to spontaneously combust? Is it printed on any special paper or any special ink? Is there anything that distinguishes the particular Next to your husband's grave. What do you mean, would have meant? Yeah. I got him, Scully. Who killed them, Jacob? Hanging a man in self defense? Is it any better? They found your book, your Sepher So, that puts you at a second crime scene. The truth. There was someone else in that attic with you. Then you're a liar. He's not our killer though. I think there was a second person in that attic, Scully. No. Somebody big enough and strong enough to knock Stick around, this could get interesting. To see a man about a burning book. There's something you didn't tell me...
I want to know about the myth of the Golem. It's the Golem that I'm interested in. That's what I was hoping you could tell me. Combinations found in that book? On the back of his hand? What's the secret word? I don't speak Hebrew, I don't know what that means. So the Golem is an imperfect creation. Destroyed, how? Yeah... Who? Okay, I can be there in ten minutes. A man with a mission. Look at all the energy he spent Well, there's no way Weiss could have killed him. I'm not so sure about that. It's not a hoax, Scully. It never was. This is not Luria. Not really. A ghost is spirit without form. I believe what we're looking It's kind of a man made monster described in Jewish folklore. I don't think it was hate that created this, Scully. Arial, it's Agent Mulder. Open the door. She's not here, Scully. Because it's her wedding day. Hang on, I've got a knife. Will he be all right? To find Arial. Arial? We found your father. He's alive. He's going to be okay. All right. Come on. We gotta get outta here. Come on, Ariel. Stop or I'll fire. Saying goodbye. Charles Figgis, ten year veteran of the US Marshals Service. Figgis and Boyce had radioed in that they were coming here to The Colombian Cartel's banking liaison. Salazar escaped I don't think he is... or was. But there were a lot of Yeah, not the type you'd expect to associate with a cartel boss. Maybe it was for the pie.
Donald Gelman. Donald Gelman, Silicon Valley software pioneer. He's been He invented the internet.
On the eve of the deal that was going to set him up as another.
Maybe that's I think somebody obviously wanted him dead. Eight unconnected dealers all at the same place at the same Well, when you're talking about Donald Gelman you want to kill Gee, I hope so. All except Gelman. And found himself under investigation by the NSA. That may be what got him killed.
I found this in his CD ROM drive. What for? Standard ID. Shipping container. Frohike says this place is really proud of its accurate tracking. Yeah. Should be straight ahead. Three rows and to Sounds like somebody's home. FBI. Come....
I'm all right! Go get her! Home sweet home. Are you Invisigoth? Donald Gelman's mailbox. You left a return address. Hey! We had just cause to come in. What is that?
Scully... Scully, we've got to get out of here right now.
It's locked. Give me the keys. Give me the keys! Get in the car, Scully! When you said it was targeting us back there, Wait, what do you mean, got loose?
You saw what happened back there, Scully. You saw that What about Star Wars? Brilliant Pebbles? Then how did it know to target the container? Who's David? Where? And you can't find it? Donald Gelman is dead. He was killed in a café. We have Donald's computer. Well, we have this.
Twilight Time. Don't let their looks fool you.
You don't want to take.
Oh, all right. But if you load the Kill Switch, what's Physically? Did he find it?
Scully?
Yeah, I've found something down in Fairfax.
Where are you? Sounds like you're driving.
You have Esther with you?
Where are you going?
Where?
David Markham.
What's going on? What's that smell?
Is it bad? My arms hurt. No, wait....
Call Call her. No. No. No-no-no-no! Ahhhhh! I feel sick. I remember... wires, and uh... What do you mean? Oh, my God. What did you do with my arm? What did.
They'll come back for what?
What do they want?! This is crazy! You have to help me. You have to Oh, I had this terrible dream. Tell them what? Nobody asked me anything. No. I... Scully! I didn't tell them anything!
Look...
Of course we do. Scully? Scully? Scully, help! Help!
Scully... I'm in here. Scully... I wonder. What if she managed to establish an uplink, Scully? A.
Artificial life. It could exist. It.
Yeah, but what are we but impulses? Electrical The subject's name is Robert Patrick Modell. He's a serial We fully expect him to pick up exactly where he left off. Modell refers to himself as pusher. Technically speaking, OK, look, this is all you need to know. Do not trust this man, Adequate backup? Every cop you can lay your hands on. What's Modell's condition? Oh yeah? How did he recover? What about his brain tumor that was supposed to be killing him? Is there anybody on staff here we can talk to? As opposed to what? What's your point? Who? Did Modell ever get any other visitors besides the Little Sisters Sounds like you got to know him pretty well. About what? He's a very considerate man.
Yeah. I don't feel like playing your game right now, Modell. Tell it to me in person, Modell. No, you listen to me. Either you come back here on your own Outside!
I'm going to take a wild stab here That's a little on the nose, don't you think? Was Nathan Bowman married? Linda. Bet that's his wife, huh?
Hi, Linda? Do you know the name of the client that Mrs. Bowman went Do you know where Mrs. Bowman went to meet Fox Mulder, Yeah. Linda Bowman? Fox Mulder. Not since 6.
00 this morning. Why didn't Modell just kill those two cops? As in too tired? Maybe. I don't know. Something's just not making sense.
Scully, I got him. Come quick.
North side of Channel, second floor. Some kind of Shut up, Modell. I said shut up. Shut up or I will shoot you, you son of a bitch. I will shoot you, shut up. I will shoot you. He had to go. Well, aside from the utter grinding humiliation that comes from No, actually it couldn't have. I didn't find Modell. Don't play the game. I don't think so. I'm not even sure he's playing a game. Then why didn't he kill the cops? Or the prison guards? Yeah, he was definitely there, but that doesn't prove that he It's not like that. Modell is involved. He's related to it somehow, but not the Yeah, that's my opinion. What do we still agree on here? That Modell was pursuing We appreciate your help. Yes. How long did you know him? No, you don't. He was true blue.
Thank you. She killed Nathan Bowman. Modell was there but for some other reason. She killed her Wait a minute, just hear me out. Her husband's brush with She was waving it under our nose, she was playing with us. Has she asked how her husband was murdered? Has she You heard it in there, Scully. But what if she can do what Modell does? You think I should go home? Who are you afraid I'm gonna point it at? I'll prove it.
Go fetch her some water! No, just anything at all that you might recall. Did he ever talk Anything remarkable he ever said that you can remember. Yeah? What was that? Was this the same nun that visited him the day before he How many times did she visit him? Would you take a look at something for me? Here... glasses. Where did you leave them? No! I need help in here! Help!
Hey, Scully, it's me. I'm at the prison. It's a little late for that now. Modell's therapist just It was Linda Bowman. The therapist would have identified her and verified that she Listen, Scully, just trace the call and cut off any access that You're not? Why isn't anybody picking up at the safe house switchboard? What happened? What happened? He pointed a gun at you? He said to you that he had a gun. Modell was unarmed. He purposely drew Skinner's fire. To protect someone. To take the fall for her. Where is she? No, it's not. If Modell makes it through surgery, I want to be the first.
OK, look, you do me a favor, Scully. Call me if he wakes up, please. Scully, what are you doing here? Scully. Where is she?
Linda Bowman!
Show yourself!
No! No!
What? What the hell are you talking about? You killed her!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I think that covers it. How's that? I almost killed my partner. Then how come I feel like I lost? Still missing. He hasn't been home or checked in with You said he was chasing this guy for almost a year? What are you thinking? That still doesn't explain why he would just vanish. He was a prison guard. It says here she was released on May 2, 1993. Lovely couple. That's a lot of money now that she doesn't have to split They were married. I don't think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation. You can see by these two bifurcations here that whoever Willis is right-handed. I checked his pistol grip at the How long did Willis flatline before you revived him? This is the EKG strip that recorded his cardiac activity.
But what does it look like? Now, you say Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest Which means for minutes, both men were technically You resuscitated his body. Two men died in that crash room, Scully. One man Dr. Varnes believes this burst of energy is responsible What about the negative consequences? That's a nice story. I sense a big but coming. For instance? How well do you know him? The plot thickens. Do you believe he's predisposed to this type of psychotic Was the television turned on when they found him? I don't think Tommy was much a reader since he doesn't.
Looks like you were right. Jack, good to see you back among the living. That's fancy shooting.
Well, by the looks of it, I wouldn't Yeah. It's, uh, Scully's birthday and I was wondering.
Happy Birthday, Scully. It's from Willis. I thought you two had the same birthday. Well, that's news to him. I asked him to sign it. Yeah. After I found out that the evidence from the The print we lifted. Our best lead is gone. Someone I'm not sure Willis is Willis. Did you forget how to sign your name? This is a copy Because it wasn't Willis who answered the hot line.
Forget it, Bruskin.
I said forget it, Bruskin. It doesn't matter what I think. We're still after the same.
Yeah.
Willis?
Where's Scully?
Let me talk to her.
Dana, are you okay?
Dana? Katensville PD just reported a drugstore was broken into 200 units of NPH insulin were taken with a box of syringes.
Mulder.
Where's Willis?
Let me talk to Scully.
We don't deal unless we know Scully is alive.
You listen to me you lay.
Forget it. Yeah, but can you squelch the voice even more this time? There. That engine sound. Is that a small plane?
Great! Okay, from our last phone contact we've identified what And for those of you who don't know already.
Ditto. Hold your positions. Keep radios at two. How do we look? We will soon enough. FBI.
Scully, are you okay? Hi. I got this from the morgue along with the rest of his.
Next of kin?
The official story. Fugitive Lula Phillips died yesterday in a shoot-out with.
Good night.
The exact time that Jack went into It means... It means whatever you want it to mean. Pretty cozy. Who'd ever want to leave. That would be one Leonard Morris Betts, age 34. Somebody cold-cocked him and stole his clothes. Did I mention that Mr. Betts had no head? Meant to conceal what? Yeah, but why take a headless one and leave so many top-dollar Unfortunately, you can't see very much on these. What Well, if this is our guy, what did he do with the corpse They combed the facility. Where could he hide an adult Well, then there's probably nothing there for us to find. Are you sure about this, Scully? Because if you're Oh.... I think I got the toy surprise.
That's his head. Where's I don't know. Maybe there's an answer here. Maybe nothing, but it's all we've got to go on right now. Check out his house. I know how he died. I Lived.
This one here.
Mulder.
What did you find?
Like the security footage.
What did your examination uncover?
Why not?
The head moved.
Blinked or winked?
You're afraid to cut into it. Scully.
But has it crossed your mind that that.
I'm standing here in Leonard Betts' apartment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna call the local PD and Michelle? Michelle Wilkes?
I'm Fox Mulder with the FBI. You're the person on Except you? What do you mean? Mm-hm. Did you ever notice anything about him – anything odd? Was he ever injured on the job? Oh, yeah. No, no. Thanks for bearing with my questions. Or you've got yourself a nice paperweight. Is something wrong with the image? He had cancer? Could you live in this condition? Well, how do you explain it? Mmmm. Mm. Maybe we're just seeing it clearly Let's get a slice to go. I'll tell you if we find it. Chuck did some of the pioneering work in Kirilian photography Coronal discharge, life force – the Chinese call it Chi. It may account for the fogging of your PET scan of Leonard.
Chuck, would you Way.
Are we happy with the results? I don't know about you, Scully, but those sure as What if it proves that Leonard Betts is alive, somehow? You said that Betts' tissue was riddled with cancer. Well, let me tell you. What if there was a case What if this man's life force – his Chi, whatever you The fluid that I found in Betts' bathtub was povidone Worms. You cut a worm in half, you get two. I'm just saying it's not unheard of in nature, that's Well, maybe Betts is trying to protect his secret. Who?
Huh. Scully. Do you know if your son ever used any other names for When did your son die?
Confused yet?
Siskel or Ebert? Why is that? Betts was here, Scully. She must have discovered Do you know how this man escaped? He tore off his But is it unimaginable? Is Betts' ability to regenerate Recent evolutionary theory would disagree. What On the other hand, how evolved can a man be who drives.
You may not want to know. Snack food. Wouldn't it make sense that evolution Ask yourself.
Why is Leonard Betts an EMT? Why does he regularly Do you think Mom knows her dead son is tooling around.
Can Scully? No sign of him, not even a stray sock. Just this. Yeah, and the key on his key ring with the number 112 Scully. It's Betts. I guarantee, Scully, this man's medical records will show His partner said he had an ability to diagnose cancer. Yeah, for the second time. You would have said the same thing about Albert Tanner. Six years ago. Albert Tanner dies in a car accident. You want to bet on that? Will the real Leonard Betts please stand up? I don't think so, Scully. I think that what we're Because I think that the fiery crash that killed this The only person connected with Betts who knows his secret Get out of the truck! Get out of the truck!
You guys get in here. Three guesses what was removed. He did this to her and then Betts is gone. He must have taken off on foot. You stay with her.
This is Special Agent Mulder with the.
We're going house-to-house, here.
I mean, he obviously worked this thing out.
What? They pronounced Betts ten minutes ago. As near as anyone can tell. His mom's alive though, Yeah. It's uh... metastatic.
You did a good job, Scully. You should We wanted... to believe. We wanted to call out. A gold-plated record depicting images, music and sounds of our Thirteen years after its launch, Voyager One passed the orbital A decade long-search by radio telescope, scanning ten million Four dollars for the first hour of parking is criminal. What Him? He's dead, Scully. I attended his funeral at Arlington through It's dangerous for us just to have a little chat, Scully. We No, no, of course not. These people are the best. So why have you bothered to come here covertly? So what do you want? They've got me on electronic surveillance. White-bread cases, No, it... Have you ever been to San Diego? Did you check out the Palomar observatory? From 1948 until recently, it was the largest telescope in the In my case... little green men. That's just the point. Seeing is not enough, I should have something I'm beginning to wonder if... if that ever even happened. Leave it, I'm watching The Magician at nine. They're next door at the Galbrands and they said I'm in charge. Samantha! Samantha! It's Bach. Brandenburg Concerto Number Three. Good thing it wasn't a Double Jeopardy question. Well, uh... recalling music appreciation with Professor Ganz, I know I've let you down. You've supported me at great risk I live for Bach. The search for extraterrestrial radio signals. They shut it What am I looking for? Gracias. No trace evidence immediately apparent around the exterior of Who are you? Who are you? What are you doing here? That's all right, settle down. Settle down. Hablo inglese?
Jorge, why are you so afraid? What have you seen? Jorge, no comprende! Did you say men? Hombres? The signal from 0630, Tuesday. The narrow band and exact matching It's just a tape machine, Jorge! Where are we going to go? There's a storm outside. The day is... the time is 10.
Although not a qualified pathologist, No! They came, Scully... the ones that took her. They were here. On the tapes... the tape. Evidence. Proof. Contact. And these printouts... it's here. And the man... No, this isn't it. Help me! I understand that leaving my assignment warrants disciplinary But I had enough on that surveillance to arrest those suspects. A minute ago, I was a four-bagger. Do you want me to make the It should be right here. I may not have the X-Files, Scully, but I still have my work. Hey, Scully. You come to spring me from the joint? About what? The big old misunderstanding? So all of a sudden, they just decide to take responsibility The facts? Have you heard their cover story? That the control So they're saying the tower put those jets on a collision course. And realizing his guilt, Sergeant Frish's fellow officer put Then they could conveniently lay the blame on a dead man. This, uh... second plane... they say it's a military fighter? You believe that story, Scully? You believe I got this from an F-Fifteen Eagle? At the second crash site, in about fifty feet of water at the Mm-hmm. I followed a trail of bubbles down to the wreckage, What collided with Flight five-forty-nine was a UFO shot down Why not? According to who? How do you know he's not lying? What information? Max Fenig's sister? Well, who is she? Why would she lie? H, how? Wait, Scully, Scully. It's got to be for the truth. If we owe them anything, it's Excuse me, sir, Max Fenig? Thanks. You have to admit, the man had an enduring sense of style. What do you mean? Hmmm, beans and weenies. Something to explain what Max was doing on that plane... what Max is the key to all this. He knew that plane was in danger You had something you wanted to tell us? I think the facts are still a matter of speculation, Mister Agent Scully and I agree on some of the motives, but not exactly No, but I do have a story if you're willing to hear it. Feel There was one man who knew what brought this plane down, and Physical proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life and Max Fenig knew immediately what this craft was and that he would A third aircraft, probably an F-Fifteen Eagle, was given the The flight controllers watched the fighter enter Flight five-forty-nine's If not for factors unforeseen, I believe Max Fenig would have Flight five-forty-nine and the alien craft which has taken control That's the Hollywood term, but yes. Yes. Not without the object that Max Fenig was carrying. That's it? Yeah, I know. And we may never know who killed Agent Pendrell. And if we don't How about Sharon Graffia? Yeah, but she knew Max well enough for him to write her thousands I'd, I'd go with you, but I'm, I'm afraid they'd lock me up. No. My name is, uh, Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I. No, why? Any idea who did this? No, Max is dead. He, he died in a plane crash a few days ago. Uh, did, did he ever mention why he would leave or where he Yeah, I'm... yeah, I'm sure. Oh, he has mail? Please. So do I. I left a bag here. Short bag, tall bag. I'm a federal officer. I need a security entrance to the terminal. Mulder. I'm at the airport in Syracuse, New York. Whatever is it that Luck. Well, what is it? Well, I'm going to let you know in a minute. What's that? I'm having trouble hearing you on the phone here. No, hold on a second, I'm going to tell you what it looks like. Hold on a second. It looks like a small superstructure with three circular pieces More people are trying to get their hands on this thing than I think it's five-oh-one. Thanks. Thanks. No, go ahead. It's all right. There's a weapon pointed at you right now. If I shoot you at I won't. A pretty lady comes around with honey-roasted peanuts? What if the pilot can't get control of the plane? Then you die I'm sure all the other passengers on this plane would appreciate What is this? It's an alien energy source, isn't it? What is it, cold fusion? I'm going to see you pay for that error... along with you and Hey, Scully, it's me. I'm standing outside an airplane bathroom where I've got the Yeah, and it looks like I'm going to miss the in-flight movie. Uh, yeah. Hey, Scully. My watch just stopped. Excuse me. Intercepted, engaged and boarded. I want you to tell the captain Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Drop it! He's not here. What time do you have? I think he got the connecting flight. No, I think you, you should consider yourself the sole curator You thinking about Pendrell? I just thought it was a pretty cool keychain.
Oncology? Thanks. Scully? I uh, stole these from some guy with a broken leg down the What uh, what exactly are we looking at here? A growth? Is it operable? But it's treatable. I refuse to believe that, I. I don't accept that. Th.there must be some people who have received I understand. I assume you'll be taking a leave of absence. Last year agent Scully and I pursued a case in which a number of No, we're with the FBI. Betsy was part of a MUFON group? Would mind if we come inside and take a look? Hey Scully listen to this.
There's two lines coming Ya but who and for what? Someone must have remote access to the system. Copying files. Let's get a trace on this before whoever it is hangs I'm going to check around back. Why don't you see if you can get Scully...
You ok in there Scully? He says he's a member of the same Mutual UFO Network group that He thinks his life's in danger, he thinks there's a government conspiracy Well he seems to know an awful lot about Betsy and the other women We can't. I want you to listen to me. About what you won't to admit to yourself, what you're denying. Where your cancer came from. It does matter, if what you have is a result of your abduction and But these women are dead. If you won't listen to me then I think you should go talk to her. If that's too hard for you then I think you should call an investigator. Mulder. Where are you Scully? I'm at Betsy Higopian's going through some of those hard files before I've made some phone calls and I've tried to get some information Why, did you find something there? Is there something I should know? I will be right there. I've got a gun pointed at your head. Turn around very slowly. Kurt You disappeared with those files from Betsy Hagopian's, I called You think you can get access from here? Vegreville. I need you to set up a meeting for me. She's at a hospital in Allentown beginning treatment. They've taken a turn. A pretty big U-turn by the looks of it. I don't know. It's just a directory for a mainframe housed in the Cigarette man.
I have no doubt in my mind he's behind this. Ya well this is different, this is different, I'm willing to deal No, no I need that meeting.
He knows what they did to Agent Scully. He may very well We are talking about Agent Scully's life. How'd you guys get in? What do you mean? Does it tell us anything at all? Why store something like this and why keep it a secret? Or a cure. You guys ever been to the Lumbard Research Facility?
Well We gots to go.
You guys couldn't spring for 2 of these?
Boys we have a problem. The doctor that's treating Scully's cancer.
Look I need someone to get to Scully to get her to stop treatment. Langly where the hell am I going? Langly can you hear me?
Langley I can't hear you. You're hybrids. You've been using me. What objective?
I've seen this boy before. And you want to destroy them? What are these? Taken from whom?
What?
Why? For genetic hybridization, or reproduction. These women, these women You're trying to save them. Langly I can't hear you. You sure it's not Byers? Langley help me out here, I don't know where I'm going. 'K Langley, Frohike I'm here open the door. Work faster. Langly open the door now!
Get me Nurse, nurse! Dana Scully is supposed to be in her room, where is No what happened to her? Well who the hell does know? What happened to Scully? Where is she now?
She gone? I'm sorry. I know what she meant to you.
When I came to Byers tell you about Dr. Scanlon? He may very well have killed those women. When we find him. Scully something was done to you, something that Come on back.
The truth will save you Scully. I think it'll I was leaving you a voicemail. It's 5.
30 what are y. I want you to know that Scully's doing ok. She says she's I was calling to thank you for your advice about your chain smoking.
Mmm, sorry about that.
Come on in.
Hmm... Young guy?
New neighbor. Why?
Uh, briefly, yeah.
He's a writer.
He didn't say.
No indication of how the killer did it?
And yet, you still refuse to believe my theory... that what.
Or... it's a grossly misunderstood area of alternative.
Well, absent another theory how else do we account for.
I mean, we have no evidence... no MO to speak of.
Hey, Scully, glad I caught you.
Yeah. I'm sure many a person's had their.
No, nothing. I mean, it's like there's nowhere to.
So far, there's absolutely nothing, Scully.
Yeah? From who?
It came here for me?
I don't think it's the.
I see it has a burning heart.
Maybe it's not me at all.
Maybe he sent it to you.
Actually, let me.
You've got a 9.
00 a.m. with the DC.
Hey, you weren't joking about being late.
Where were you?
For what?
No, I think I was wrong.
I think it's very significant.
I think.
Who, the writer?
You're kidding.
Is... he our killer?
Did you get his name?
I'm sorry I forgot your name.
Padgett.
You're a writer.
Anything I'd know?
A murder case.
Possibly.
Mr. Popularity.
Scully.
You all right?
Putting this man under arrest.
Yeah, it's how you found your victims... in the personals.
And you targeted them.
No, you targeted...
Then this is your confession?
It's all in there... every detail, every murder, all laid out.
The murders.
How about the stranger?
Is that you?
How about Ken.
Is that your accomplice?
Did you direct him to do it?
Which is the truth?
Why, Mr. Padgett?
Maybe that's a question you can answer.
Maybe if it were fiction.
To find his accomplice, the Brazilian psychic surgeon.
Where is he now?
He can't be.
Padgett couldn't have done this alone.
Scully, it's all on the page.
How else would he know it?
No one can predict human behavior.
No one can tell you.
If he imagines it, it's a priori... before the fact.
You know you're in here, don't you?
Well, let's just say it ends with you doing the.
Mmmm.
Well, you might want to finish it.
No signs of a possible struggle at the grave site but the.
The only thing that he imagined was us out here...
...looking like idiots.
Hands where I can see 'em!
Don't move until I tell you!
I imagined it.
What do you need, a signed work order?
You're about to argue my usual side, aren't you?
You read his book.
You read what he wrote about you.
I don't know how they communicate.
This is the only.
What's that, Mr. Padgett?
Anything?
What's he up to now?
Now what?
Padgett!
Freeze.
Step away from the incinerator.
What do you think you're doing?
Destroying evidence, you mean.
Let me see what you wrote.
You came down here to give these instructions to your.
When?
You were alone up there.
Why? You hear any good ones lately?
Merry Christmas, by the way, Scully.
Grave robbery with a twist.
Check out the headliner, Scully.
Indeed it does.
To answer your question... no, I haven't been.
Well, got one pile of dirt.
I'm guessing one man with a shovel.
Did I?
Faked for what effect?
Looks like blood.
Should something stand out?
Well, only that I don't think it was grave robbery per se.
The summoning of the dead.
It's a form of magic dating.
No, that's what he was doing.
This is a, uh...
He may also desire to wear the clothes of the dead man to.
That is the question.
It's an ouroboros... Possibly.
Definitely a mystical symbol.
And that it was, in fact, a cult based upon Judeo-Christian.
How long were you going to sit on this?
I think I know where to start.
Only by reputation.
He left, um.
Vi-Cap before I got there.
Good morning.
Yeah.
Frank Black?
Hi, my name is, uh, Fox Mulder.
This is my partner, Dana Scully.
Who's playing?
Ah, the Fighting Irish and the Golden Eagles, huh?
Well, we're working on a case that, uh, we feel that you.
We're not asking you to get involved.
I'm just asking you to.
Mr. Black, the day after tomorrow is January 1, 2000.
Well, Mr. Black, you are not what I was expecting.
Yes.
It's third and ten.
It's third and ten, Notre Dame.
Same to you.
Our necromancer was definitely here.
And they were large enough to contain a body.
This is just a.
Whatever it was that did that.
Bite marks.
They look human.
I am he that liveth and was dead, and, behold, I am.
Go Fighting Irish.
First and 18.
It's not football.
it's Revelations.
You wanted.
Right, so you'll occasionally drop the little arcane hint?
But you obviously want to help.
You... dropped that clue on us.
With the express purpose of being brought back to life.
The Four.
So is he a member of the Millennium Group as well?
So this is the one event that'll give his life meaning.
These four members of the Millennium Group... the ones that.
He's not our murderer, and those four dead bodies aren't dead.
Nobody likes a math geek, Scully.
I do, too.
I absolutely think you should.
Follow the profile.
The deputy was killed on a road that connects.
Welcome to the boondocks.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open it!
Yeah... I'm down here.
They're all around.
You armed?
Shoot for the head.
That seems to stop 'em.
I don't know.
They're hiding.
Yeah, I think so.
Look out!
Frank, good luck with everything.
The world didn't end.
Happy New Year, Scully.
I have the same pair I'm going to assume the killer knew what he was doing.
She's been blind since birth. Fraud... petty theft... aggravated assault. So, what, you think that uh, she caught Little Monster Including how a blind girl could get the drop on an ex-con All right, so you really believe that she did this?
Well how soon can I meet her?
Special Agent Mulder. An innocent woman. I hope. How did you know there was just one stab wound? Mmm hmm. I'm curious, Marty. If you didn't kill him, why you were at the crime scene Why don't we just stop playing games here, okay? Or we can just... All I see is a woman who's adapted to her impairment admirably. I dunno I - I think she just wants us to think she's I don't think she did do it. Yeah. You go ahead. I want - I want to – I want to investigate All right, let's, uh, get to it. Did you see the murder? Did you see the murder?
She's lying.
She knew Paco Ordonez, but I don't think.
Well I made her take a polygraph test.
No, she cracked, Scully. She was.
Not with her eyes.
I don't know. Even if the gloves do fit, you can still acquit. I don't think it's that simple. Look at this. I have no idea. I don't – I think that's the most accurate scenario available to What?
You think she's faking it? Then what is that? What is it, Marty? What do you see? No. No, according to her examiner, she is completely She doesn't exactly fit the definition blind girl. Well, there is evidence of some kind of neurological activity To me, it indicates some reaction to stimuli. Some I didn't say it did. Yes. Well, she was examined. There were no cuts or wounds I read your confession. Detective Pennock is typing You'll make him a very happy man. Just for me, I'm a little puzzled by this sudden change I - I just... why kill them. Paco Ordonez... Susan I like you, Marty. I admire you. And I No, I don't. Not the way you think I do. I believe you witnessed both murders. You - you I think you tried to stop them. You tried to, but Marty, whoever did this, they're going to kill again. Who's worth pleading guilty for, Marty? You didn't do it. And I'm not going to let this happen. Congratulations. Well, all you've got is a signature. No lawyer's Doesn't it bother you, Detective, that you still have Well, if you think about it, Detective, it actually proves Just like she described. Skeptical?! I've been called a lot of things. Skeptical, however.
Skeptical..
What?
Well, I know that, and you know that, I know who you're protecting, Marty. And I think I know I read the original police report from 1970. Your No. I know. But for once you were there when it happened. I think that during that time... as you lost one You see through his eyes. You always have. There's absolutely no point to you doing this, Marty. Hi, Marty. Detective Pennock is with the warden right now arranging The charges against you are being dropped. You're Yeah, well, confession is worthless if it's a lie, and Just that you're innocent, which is something they would Yeah, well, somebody else wasn't so careful. Charles I happen to believe that, Marty. The PCR tests confirmed.
Detective Pennock has agreed I'm sure that's what you've always wanted. All right, stand by. Just in time for the surprise party. Yeah, she described this place perfectly, right down to She didn't know his name. They've never met. I - I don't think she was sure exactly what she was seeing He was paroled and everything changed. Everything's changed for her, Scully. I don't think we're She doesn't want us to get him. She misdirected No, she's not. She never was.
It's not him she's been protecting. If he goes back Is it my cologne? Marty, let me speak to the judge on your behalf. We found where he'd been staying. It was a motel Well, you're lucky he wasn't a fan of the Ice Capades. Where'd you get this? Reverend Calvin Hartley. The boy's his adopted son, Samuel. He claims to have It's more than a claim. The man he saved appears as a For what? Fraud? What was the cause of death? When do we leave for Tennessee? I think I saw some of these same people at Woodstock. I saw the movie. No, wait, wait, this is the part where they bring out Elvis. Well, where is he? Yeah. Oh, yeah. This is Special Agent Dana Scully. Something tells me you're not a member of the Reverend People want to believe, you know. Well, even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes, it's still a long You think that's how he killed them? With a touch? Sheriff. Looks like you may have a few believers on the payroll. Let's go. Hey, Sheriff? What evidence do you have to charge the Look at him, though. He's drunk. Let me have a minute with him? Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully - from Guilty of murder? How'd you do it, Samuel? Really? What pain is that?
I want to hear more about this pain. What else do you see? Hey, I need another minute with him. I don't know. And when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
... land, and all the fruit of the Yeah, maybe in a cornfield, but this happened in a courtroom. I had these patient cases sent over from Kenwood County I've encountered dozens of psychic healers in the X-Files, Well, western medicine treats the human body in But the body can also be treated as an electromagnetic Why not? Well, you heard him, Scully. He muddied the river of his Why did you want to speak with us? Samuel's being tried for murder. I think what you need Well, how can you be sure of that? Somehow, I don't think that argument will work on a jury. Excuse me.
Hey, where'd she go? A little girl. It's a girl. A little girl. Do you think the boy really did it? Why not?
You must have really liked 'The Exorcist'? I thought I saw someone I knew. Why do you say that? I've seen her twice now. Oh... I'm not delusional, Scully. You think this is what Margaret Hohman and her parents Do I have to? What would cause that? How soon? See who you can push to have it done, as soon as possible. Samuel? It's Agent Mulder. I want to talk with you. If you'd prefer your attorney were I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels. He's on his way down Did you poison Margaret Hohman? Did you poison her using potassium or sodium cyanide, You're innocent, Samuel - unless you had a hand in Well, the evidence will be presented at your arraignment Look, Samuel, if you think that the punishment for your I can't stand here and argue with your Biblical rhetoric, but You said you could see my pain. Look at me.
I don't believe you. I've seen her. It was her, wasn't it? You made her appear to me, didn't you? Look at me.
Is she alive? Is that what I'm supposed to.
Jailer! I called you down here to ask you to release the boy. His innocence. I don't want to pick a fight. He seems determined to stay It tells me that you're determined to have him charged, while What look is that? Clues. Let's find out. Scully.
It's potato. Biological supply houses usually hatch them on order to farms I'll call an ambulance. Who?
Mulder.
Scully.
Sheriff Any witnesses? She saw somebody take the body? What do you mean, not actually?
You coming, Sheriff? And you're sure it was him? I have a strong sense the Reverend Hartley's not going to be It might even strengthen his faith. Remember, the boy did Somehow, I don't think so. I think people are looking hard for miracles... so hard that.
Son of a...
Yes... Yes.
Hello?
....
It's coming through down there?.. Ugh!...
I know.
I missed the meeting.
What are you doing down here?
I'm having the best damn day of my life.
Any.
Bank's just down the street.
I'll be back in ten.
Cover for me.
You're the boss.
It's all right.
Zip a dee doo dah.
Hey, lock the doors. You forgot to lock the front.
Oh, son of a...
Son of a bitch.
Oh...
that's great.
Yeah?.. It's coming through down there?
... It's my damn.
Aw...
Damn it.
I know.
I missed the meeting.
What are you doing down here, then?
Scully, did you ever have one of those days you wish you could.
So you think it's all just fate?
We have no free will?
And all the rest is just preordained?
I don't buy that.
There's.
I might just as easily not have a waterbed then I'd be on time for.
Free will. With every choice, you change your fate.
I endorsed my damn check stub.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
I pass you... and then we die.
Drop your weapon!
What do you think I'll do then?
Bernard... that's your name, right?
You can end this the right way.
Noooo!!!
Yeah, I know.... Yeah, I know.
I know.
Oh, hey.
Did I miss the meeting?
Wow, that is so strange.
I just got the weirdest sensation of deja vu.
I've been having it.
Yeah, but never to this degree.
I mean, I woke up, I opened my.
It's a long story but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived.
I wonder what it means.
Well, you know, some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon to be.
Whatever's wrong.
Yeah? Well, but what if it were?
Yeah... so that I could right some wrong or change fate.
No.
Actually, I'm fated to go to the bank.
Cradock. Right down the street.
What?
What did she look like?
I'll use the ATM machine.
I don't want to tempt fate.
You match a description.
You're the, uh...you're the woman that.
What always ends the same?
We go inside the bank... and we all die.
That's what you told my.
You're saying this day repeats over and over again.
If what you're saying is true, how come I don't remember it?
How.
What's the answer?
Um, excuse me uh... Agent Arnold.
Um, where's.
Uh, excuse me.
Um...
Drop your weapon!
He's got a bomb.
He's got a bomb.
I know, I know.
I missed the meeting.
The.
Do I know you?
Yeah, you just look really familiar to me.
Yeah.
No?
Uh, all right.
I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.
...He's got a bomb.
He's got a bomb.
He's got a.
I'm at the bank.
Scully, I need you to do something for me right now.
Take it.
I'm a federal agent.
I don't want us all to.
You've got a girlfriend outside in the car and you've got a bomb.
You could change your fate.
If you don't believe me, ask her.
Listen to me, Bernard...
You get her out of here.
You're dooming her.
You're making her.
Every day you die in here and every day it starts all over again.
Put your gun down, Scully.
Trust me, it's the only way to get out.
Yeah?
I'm late again, aren't I, Scully?
I'll be there in an hour.
Well, you were there, Scully.
Call it a feeling.
I don't think she was an.
I'll be there in an hour. Scully, since we've been away, much of the unexplained has been explained. The Death Valley Racetrack?
Turns out it was just ice formations, moving the rocks around as it melted. Yeah, ice. Humility prevents me from recounting how I once thought it had something to do with a series of mysterious sightings of a rock-like creature in Colorado...
which turned out to just be a publicity stunt by a local landscaping business. It's amazing, going through these archives with fresh - if not wiser - eyes, how many of these cases, whether it's The Amarillo Armadillo Man.
or The Hairy Whatsit of Walla Walla.
...can be explained away as fraternity pranks, practical jokes or people making stuff up simply because they're bored and or crazy. And if that doesn't explain it, well then it was probably just ice. Scully, Charles Fort spent his entire life researching natural and scientific anomalies, which he published in four books, all of which I know by heart.
And at the end of his life, Fort himself wondered if it hadn't all been a waste. I get it. I'm a middle-aged man, Scully. No, I am, I am.
I'm thinking maybe it's time to put away childish things.
the Sasquatches and mothmen and.
jackalopes.
I thought it'd be great to get back to work.
But is this really how I want to spend the rest of my days?
Chasing after monsters? Notice they didn't get a picture of it, which is odd - because everybody always has a camera on them these days.
Ohhhhhh... Of course not. Mountain lions always attack from behind. He was out here responding to a call about a mountain lion. It was a mountain lion! That's what killed the other victim, too.
Grey wolves, Scully. They've made a comeback in this region. Wolves take their prey back to a lair. Maybe he was a nudist. Took a midnight hike in the nude, got attacked by a wolf or a lion or a bear. Maybe all at the same time. That's how I'd like to go out. Aw, Scully, I gave up profiling before I gave up monsters. You've seen one serial killer, you've seen 'em all. Okay.
When you put it that way.
But mark my words, Scully, when we catch whatever is doing these killings.
it's only going to have two eyes.
Looks like you gave it a pretty good shot. Hmm. Did it look anything like this? Did you see which way it headed? Are you? Any sign of anything? Career decisions? If this thing looks like what people say it looks like, I'm gonna get a good picture of it. Ah, it's this new camera app.
I'm not sure if it's working right. I don't know, it's this new app.
I don't know if it's working right. I don't know. Where? No, I'm okay. I don't think it's mine.
I got a picture! Have you seen a...? That's its ear.
Or maybe...
maybe it's a foot. This one...
if you squint, looks like...
something. And then this... That's... that's in focus! It's a close-up.
Of the creature.
Now, mind you, I didn't say monster. And it wasn't a Sasquatch.
But it was definitely an animal...
man-sized and hairless. Ah. Hey.
You're overlooking the video. Look. Yeah, it's the new camera app.
But look. It shot blood at me.
From out its eyeball, Scully. I think.
It was hard for me to see, because I had blood in my eyes. Oh, no? Well, tell that to the horned lizard.
Which shoots blood out its eyeball, Scully, yes.
It's a defense mechanism.
Scientific fact! Doesn't this bear a resemblance to what witnesses claim they saw? Whoa. Let's just keep this within the realm of the natural sciences, shall we? So we're looking for a man-sized horned lizard with human teeth? Sounds a bit silly, doesn't it? You're really enjoying yourself, aren't you, Scully? Everything okay in here? I heard someone yell Monster! Of course not.
Oh, hello again. Just looking for the ice machine... I-I'm not gonna report you.
When one checks into an establishment such as this, one expects the manager to be a Peeping Tom.
But I do harbour suspicions that you saw something in that trashed room that greatly disturbed you.
You mind telling me what that was? Try me. Is this the creature that you saw?
But with two eyes? And is this the man? It's a monster, Scully, plain and simple. And not just your everyday, run-of-the-mill monster, but we're talking transformation here.
Man into monster and back again.
To which I know you're going to say.
But Mulder, that only happens in werewolf myths that were originally concocted to explain away the violent behaviour of people who'd been bitten by rabid animals, before the medical discovery of rabies. But is it so outlandish to believe that some legends are based on actual occurrences and not just ignorance? To which I know what you're going to say, Scully, you're going to say.
But Mulder, it defies every known law of science and nature. Exactly, Scully, every known law.
What if this creature that we've stumbled upon is here to create a whole new paradigm for our understanding of life itself?
Or maybe science was used to create this unnatural being.
Maybe this is some GMO experiment run amok by some military-agro-big-pharma corporation.
Maybe this guy is its chief geneticist, who recklessly experimented on himself and now transforms into a fiend who needs to feast on human flesh.
To which I know you're going to say.
But Mulder, that sounds like the paranoid ravings of some lunatic madman. I don't know what this thing is, Scully, and I don't know exactly how it came to be, I just...
All I'm saying is, it's a monster. So you're agreeing with me?
But what about the facts? This guy - who the manager just saw turn into a monster - was wearing the clothes of one of our victims, which we did not notice at the time, because we thought we were looking for an animal.
Turns out we were only half right. Well, I doubt he's coming back to his room.
I did retrieve some personal items from it, though, that might help us track him down. The first thing we need to do, though...
check out of this motel. Wh... why the green glass?
And why the appendix? The moral being...? Not everything can be reduced to psychology. Werewolf? Why not? Your, uh, records don't provide much information, and I'm assuming that Guy Mann is not a real name.
Do you have any idea of how I might find him? Do you really think that's sound therapeutic advice? Thank you, Doctor. For me? Why me? Really? Where are you? I'll be right there. What the hell happened? What are you doing? You know it's not safe to approach a dangerous suspect without backup. Which way did he go?
Did you lose somebody recently? It doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, does it? I don't mean to intrude, but you seem to have something weighing heavily on you.
It might help to get it off your chest. If you have something to confess. But you're not thinking of doing anything crazy, are you?
Huh? I know what you're trying to do.
The green glass, the appendix.
But I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna kill you.
I want to help you. Okay. I'll do it. I'll kill you. But first I want to hear how this happened to you. The whole story. Wait.
I'm confused already.
You said you were going to start at the beginning. So you're saying a man bit you?
That looks like a hickey. Is this what you look like when you're normal? So wh... when did you...
first transform? A human victim? Uh... Putting aside the logistics of no Social Security number, no references... You wouldn't happen to be, uh, B.S-ing me right now about all this, would you? I find that... disconcerting. Who did you kill? In your natural state, you're a vegetarian? Ahh...
You attacked and killed someone? Daggoo?! Strangle him and eat his flesh? Now we're getting somewhere. That's because she used to be... uh, she once... She's transgender. It's not nuts. It's actually a very common medical procedure. You don't need the surgery, technically... No. Completely different. They cut off.
your genitals. Yeah. That was me, actually. But wait... how could you have changed back into a man? It wasn't morning yet... I'm just looking for some kind of internal logic. Jackalopes aren't real. They-they were a hoax perpetrated by a Wyoming taxidermist in 1932. They... they don't exist....Stop!
That... did not happen. You made that up. I thought I was going to believe you, but it's all... it's just too... fantastic. No, I mean it's just... silly. It's my life, too. You and me, we're the same, Guy. We both want to believe in things that aren't real - or even possible. I know that. So Hamlet is not just calling Horatio an ignorant idiot, he's calling us all ignorant idiots? I'm in town investigating the murders. Hey, Scully. I fell off the wagon, Scully.
I got a little taste of my old monster-hunting ways and then I downed the whole bottle. Yeah, it turns out it wasn't a man who turns into a lizard, it was a lizard who turns into a man. That's the point, Scully, there is no difference.
Both scenarios are equally foolish.
And I was foolish to believe...
well, maybe I was just a fool, Scully.
Maybe I always have been. Where are you? So he didn't quit after all, huh? What was that? What happened? A bite? Scully? This is Agent Mulder with the FBI.
I need emergency backup to the animal control shelter.
And where the hell is the animal control shelter? Scully! Are you okay? Did you know it was him before coming here? Scully, that is the second time you've approached a dangerous suspect without backup. What's going on? Oh. Oh, I was going over those photos I took and I realized one was of a bite mark, so if Guy's story were true, it means he must have been bitten by... If Guy's story were true? Guy! Hey, Guy!
We caught the killer. So... for a while there, I thought maybe it was you. It means that I...
I know now...
you were telling the truth. Well, you have to admit, it's, uh...
it's a little absurd. No. What are you doing? I didn't know that, uh, reptiles hibernated. O-O-Okay... Okay. How-how long do you hibernate for? That's... not possible. I want to believe! Like... Likewise. One at a time, boys. Now what's going on? I've been here twenty minutes and I still don't know what the Cancer Man? What did you find? Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted. Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent.
My name is Fox Mulder.
Since my childhood, I have been obsessed by a controversial global phenomenon. Since my sister disappeared when I was 12 years old, in what I believe was an alien abduction. My obsession took me to the FBI, where I investigated paranormal science cases through the auspices of a unit known as the X-Files.
Through this unit I could continue my work on the alien phenomenon, and the search for my missing sister. In 1993, the FBI sought to impugn my work, bringing in a scientist and medical doctor to debunk it, which only deepened my obsession for the better part of a decade, during which time that agent, Dana Scully, had her own faith tested. In 2002, in a change of direction and policy, the FBI closed the X-Files, and our investigation ceased. But my personal obsession did not. There are 10,000 sightings each year in North America alone, and so it's been since the dawn of time. Stone Age and even biblical references, into our modern age. In 1947, Kenneth Arnold saw nine unidentified craft out the window of his small plane, followed by the historic crash at Roswell and its legendary cover-up. In 1957, UFOs were spotted over our nation's capital.
The Pentagon held press briefings. Multiple witnesses in 1967 at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana see fighters scramble but easily outrun by UFOs that climb upwards of 200,000 feet - twice the service ceiling of our highest-flying spy planes. Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the Moon, cites secret studies on extraterrestrial materials and bodies.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and future president Gerald R. Ford validate the UFO phenomenon in official government memoranda. But now people only laugh, and only Roswell is remembered. But we must ask ourselves.
are they really a hoax? Are we truly alone? Or are we being lied to? My life's become a punchline. What's happening out there, Scully? Why doesn't he just call me? What does he want, Scully? Hold on. I'm bringing him up. Why would I watch this jackass, Scully?
I thought you were done with UFOs. The stranglehold they put on your very existence, I believe is how you put it. Tell Skinner to set it up. And don't pretend I'm going alone. Hitchhiked. Relax, Scully. I'm kidding. Not to worry, Doc. I'm taking good care of myself. It certainly was good for you. And I'm always happy to find a reason. Yes. She shot men with less provocation. I'd be happy to talk to you, Mr. O'Malley, but right here is fine. None for me, thanks. Scully? Air's getting a little hot in here. 'Cause you never know when a gun-toting liberal might go Hinckley. No, I only want to believe. Actual proof has been strangely hard to come by. I'm afraid that book is closed. Yes, we have. For better or for worse. What is the point, Mr. O'Malley? And how does a man with your conservative credentials count himself a believer in UFOs and 9/11 false flag conspiracies? Conspiracy sells... it pays for bulletproof limousines. I think you're The O'Reilly Factor with a shopworn little gimmick. The Kelly Cahill incident. Apparently, he has something to show us. Hi. And how would you know to do that? No, I think I'd remember. Something you could test? Dana? I was right about one thing. Conspiracy's made you a very rich man. My pursuit's not been so lucrative. A Faraday cage? For what? That's what you brought me here to see? That's an alien replica vehicle? No, never. Not like that. You're talking about free energy? Oil companies making trillions. Gravity warp drive but... how? Where did you get it? Hitchhiked. There was a moment you were being asked about your abductions... about your pregnancies, how the aliens took your babies and before you answered, you looked at O'Malley. Why? I'm sorry, I don't understand. But you said you were abducted. Well, everything stays between us, Sveta. What are you afraid of? Sveta, who took your babies? Men? Humans? You saw their faces? It's why you... didn't see a doctor... You can trust me. Technically, but not for years. Scully, listen to me. I've been misled. We've been misled. No, just... just listen to what I'm saying. What if everything we've been led to believe in is a lie? What if there is no alien conspiracy? I'm talking about everything we've been led to believe. Our work, the X-Files, everything. I know why O'Malley came to us, Scully.. And that girl is the key, Scully. Sveta is the key to everything. I can't do this over the phone right now, Scully. I got to go. Where are they... the files? You said no one had been down here - it hadn't been touched. I need access to the X-Files. It's about controlling the past to control the future. It's about fiction masquerading as fact. Now, you owe me some answers, Skinner. No. Who do you take orders from? A decade of my life in this office. And all the time, I was being led by my nose through a dark alley to a dead end, exactly as they planned. No, I'm blaming myself. I'm sure they lied to you, too. How they police us and spy on us, tell us that makes us safer?
We've never been in more danger. Now you've got my number. It was important that I see you. I took the usual precautions. I'm assuming you did too? I've been standing here for over an hour. I haven't seen a soul. I called you because you said, if I ever put the pieces together, that you would confirm. I've met someone. I've seen something. I was being cleverly manipulated. I saw an ARV, running on free energy. I saw it disappear. But the technology exists. It's existed since Roswell. And it's been in use, being used on humans in human testing, the taking of men, women and children that's misreported as alien abductions. Yes. And I think I know the why. 60 years ago we were warned about the military industrial complex gathering too much power. The countdown has begun. It began in 2012 but no one knew. Alien technology being used against us. Not by aliens, not with aliens, but by a venal conspiracy of men against humanity. What are the tests for? Ten years ago, you came to me, saying you couldn't take your secrets to your grave, that you couldn't live with it. So let me tell the world. Then let me take that bullet.
So I've been told. What are you doing here, Scully? I figured it out. It all makes complete sense. All these years we've been deceived. I... I couldn't call you because it's gonna sound crazy. All right just listen to me, all right? Scully, you got to trust me on this. This will finally be their undoing. This is my life. This is everything. This is everything I believe in. I do believe. I believe that Tad O'Malley is right. This is not an alien conspiracy. It's a conspiracy of men. No, he woke me up. He's been a godsend. The truth is out there Scully, and Tad O'Malley's gonna broadcast it. I know what I'm doing.
Yeah, everything is okay.
She's the key to everything. Sveta... is the key. Scully... I would have invited you, Scully, but I didn't think you'd come. The tentacles reach far back into the last century, but it wasn't until victories in Europe and Japan and the onset of the Cold War that political and economic conditions became perfect for actual execution. A conspiracy bigger and more secret than the Manhattan Project. No sooner had we defeated Germany than a new threat started appearing in skies over America, drawn to Earth by the latest threat to extinction - the H-bomb.
Explosions acting as transducers, drawing alien life forms through wormholes in spaceships using electro-gravitic propulsion.
Advanced extraterrestrial species visiting us, concerned for mankind and the threat of our self-destruction, forestalling our annihilation through their own self-sacrifice.
The crashes at Roswell.
More importantly, places like Aztec.
World leaders signed secret memos directing scientific studies of alien technology and biochemistry.
Classified studies were done at military installations, S4, Groom Lake, Wright Patterson and Dulce - extracting alien tissue.
Tests were done on unsuspecting human subjects in elaborately staged abductions, in craft using alien technology recovered from the downed saucers...
including human hybridisation through gene editing and forced implantation of alien embryos. Your own government lies as a matter of course, as a matter of policy.
The Tuskegee experiments on black men in the '30s, Henrietta Lacks... That's the missing piece. The takeover of America.
The other shoe waiting to drop. Digital money will disappear. Followed by the detonation of strategic electromagnetic pulse bombs to knock out major grids. Or a simulated alien invasion using alien replica vehicles that exist and are already in use. The Russians tried it in '47.
It's irresponsible not to say it. What do you mean, negative? They got to her. Sveta? Sveta?
SVETA? There's something called the Venus Syndrome.
It's a runaway global warming scenario that leads us to the brink of the Sixth Extinction.
Those with means will prepare to move off the planet into space, which has already been weaponized against the poor, huddled masses of humanity that haven't been exterminated by the über-violent fascist elites.
If you believe in that kind of thing. It was a long day at the office... They're very good, these guys, you know? I'm sure they scared her to death. Why? You said her tests came back negative. Are you saying she has alien DNA? Scully... what are you saying?
Skinner. Scully, are you ready for this? And these unknown craft. Where were the majority sighted? You said others. Are any of them with you in America? Can you verify each of you worked on the base? Credentials If you're mentioned in Thread Three you must have been there I made a last ditch effort to get out of it, but the Bureau What do you mean?
I always assumed that that was your Okay, so we'll have them send down another desk and there That contact that we met last night at the Wall who had the At a high price, yeah. That's your assignment while I'm gone.
What do you mean? Eenie, meenie, chili beanie, the spirits are about to speak? So you're refusing an assignment based on the adventures of Do what you want. Don't go to Philadelphia, But You don't want it to be. Well, maybe it's good that we get away from each other for a Ironically enough, it's personal. It's a... place I always wanted Oh, hey. Scully, it's me.
I'm.
Scully.
Nothing's wrong. I checked where we always stay in Philadelphia. I knew The Philadelphia bureau? They don't know or care about How do you know? Okay, just hold off until I get there, okay? Of course I believe that you're capable, it's just that Wh-what's the agent's name in Philadelphia?
What, have you got a date, or something? Dana Scully, please. Thank you.
Welcome back. You look a lot better than you did in the The uh, field office in Dallas is uh, receiving reports Yes but it's m - - Come on in. Something that just came in the mail. According to the magazine ad I answered, it's an alien autopsy. Twenty-nine ninety-five, plus shipping. But it, it does look authentic. Well, maybe it's this green substance they seem to be extracting It's widely held that aliens don't have blood, Scully. Where's the alien. No, that, that autopsy you saw on TV was so fake precisely because Yes, and because, uh... Some guy in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Claims he pulled it off Back door's been busted open. Federal agent! Did you try the F.B.I. field office? Well, look at this... a beacon in the night. You don't, uh, speak Japanese by any chance, do you? A murder suspect, yeah. What are you talking about? This man, sitting in here? Oh, I didn't get his name. I was too busy getting my ass kicked. Tracking down a video piracy thing. Obviously not strengthening the international relations. No, I paid my twenty-nine ninety-five, Scully. I think I'm entitled I just remembered a piece of evidence from the crime scene that They look like satellite photos. Maybe he was going to fit her for a pillowcase too. Why don't I'm going to go back to D.C. like a good boy, like Skinner told So you're saying that's from a German satellite? Got to love that global economy, huh? Japanese diplomat. What exactly are they spying on there? Did they find it? Why do you say that? The naval shipyard. Well, maybe what they found wasn't a Japanese sub. It's a salvage ship registered in San Diego. According to the The D.E.A.? Why, what was the problem? Did they find anything? Were they? Well, that doesn't make any sense. The Talapus came nonstop from Panama. She would have had to Would you do me a favor? Would you see if there's any paperwork That's all right. I'm happy to wait. I don't remember giving you a key. Yeah, I guess I should really fire my maid, shouldn't I? What are you talking about? Our murder suspect. What do they think was in it? Am I being accused of murder? Agent Scully has it. I don't know, I haven't spoken to her since I left her in Allentown. Mind if I tidy up a bit in here first? Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. Then you already know what I'm up against. I need your advice on how to proceed. I'd be implicating myself. But I can't afford to become entangled in a murder investigation. Because of what I've seen. Because it would give them time to I'm listening. What kind of project? What am I onto here? Scully. I got something to show you. Allentown? Oh, what'd you find? But you're fine, aren't you, Scully? That is disturbing. But I don't think you should freak out until That's a group of Japanese medical officers taken during World No, I don't think so. Not unless you were in Japan in the last His name is Doctor Takeo Ishimaru, he's been dead since 1965. Four of the doctors you see in this photo were on that videotape Somebody could, because those same four men were murdered yesterday, That's what I'd like to know. Possibly our government. For continuing their work. The work the Nazis were doing, trying Scully, after all you've seen... after all you've told me you've You think that believing is easy? Part of our government's secret railroad. Train cars used to From someone like you who wants proof... Hey, Scully, it's me. A trainyard in Quinnimont, West Virginia. A group of Japanese Something serious is going down here, Scully. The thing they put in the train? It was alive. I got to get on that train. It's hooking up with a Canadian Well, that's where you know him from, then. Express train to Vancouver, what track is it on? When, when did it leave? Thanks. Mulder. Why not? Who told you that? Who told you, Scully? I can't. I think what we feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know. It's too soon, Mrs. Scully. We can't give up. Who...?
How did she get here? Is that Daly? Was it, was it paramedics, FBI, military? Answer me right now! What, you're telling me she just appeared? Who did this to her!? I want to see her admission forms. Who did this to her? I want I'd like her examined for trace evidence.
She doesn't want to live in this condition. By who? Dana talked to you just now? If she talked, the EEG would have You're Scully's sister. She's not here. I need to do more than just wave my hands in the air. Frohike? There's plenty of room down there. I'm doing my laundry. What? Branched DNA? What's it used for? You mean a high-tech identity card? Will she live? Hey! There was a man, he took Scully's blood. Get that gun out of my face... You ignore my call for help and then you expect me to do what What the hell are you talking about? I owe her more than just sitting around doing nothing. She's not dead. Okay, then tell me. Tell me! Federal agent! Wait! It's possible branched DNA can be treated with designer antibiotics. You've never provided an answer as to why she's here or what's She's here because of unnatural circumstances. That's very politically correct. Is this about the tooth that was found in the cafeteria jello? No, sir. I was with Scully. May I see the police report? Since I am unfamiliar with any such incident, sir, no, how would How's it feel? Constant denial of everything, questions answered Him. That's what happened. It's a rumor. Who is he? Oh, you can have it all, you can have my badge, you can have That's what I want. What if I... I knew the potential consequences but I... I never Including myself? No. Sorry, I don't. Sit down! Shut up! Tonight, I ask the questions! You're going to answer Why her? Why her and not me? You should be the one to die.
Right? Who are you to decide what's right? At least back then, it wasn't just wasted space. All the forensics, the field investigations, the eyewitness You. But we barely know each other. How? Waiting. Because the lights aren't on. No, I can't. Yeah, I would. I can't, not right now. Enough with the harmonic convergence crap, okay? You're not I feel, Scully... that you believe... you're not ready to go. I'm here. How you feeling? Doesn't... doesn't matter. I know you want to get some rest, I... just came by to see... I was holding this for you.
Two men, young, idealistic - the fine product of a.
Theirs was the dawn of Armageddon.
And while the.
Who are you!
Who are you?!
What's going on?!
Who are you?!
Who are you?!
There must be some kind of mistake.
I signed up for the aroma.
Where the hell do you think we are?
Who called you?
Scully...
Scully...
Hey... I heard gray is the new black.
No. Actually, you hide your feelings very well.
Apparently not. I just spoke to AD Skinner.
He was at the hospital.
Well, then why did she come to my apartment demanding to be killed?
No. It won't continue.
It doesn't have to anymore.
She knows what.
I think she's the one, Scully.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, oh, Ma'am.
These shoes?
They're, they're two.
A pair that fit, maybe?
Marita?
Who?
What have they done to you?
Like the tests on Cassandra Spender?
Then what were the tests on you?
In secret from the alien colonists.
The hybrid program was in.
To make a vaccine and build a weapon.
She's the first, isn't she? She's the first successful alien human.
The latest in home security.
I got a call from Scully.
Said it was urgent.
I don't have time for this.
I know her, Scully. You don't.
I hope you've got something.
For the purpose of what?
MUFON.
So she's collecting data.
Big deal.
Scully, you're reaching.
So you're suggesting that Diana is monitoring these abductees?
Because you've given me no reason here to do otherwise.
Scully, you're making this personal.
Diana?
Diana?
Sorry.
Nobody home. What.
Interesting company you keep.
You feeling smug, C.G.B.?
Yeah, I know your name.
I know your.
Why?
That presumes my cause is wrong.
I'm not the one using innocent people - innocent women - as lab.
You find that funny?
He didn't give up my sister.
He was forced to.
You made him do.
Towards your own selfish end.
No, you only managed to postpone it.
You put those lives on hold so you alone could survive.
You gave them your children! You gave them your wife! You sent them.
You sent them away to be tested on.
You're a liar.
My sister wasn't taken from any hangar.
She was.
And now you've succeeded?
To work secretly on a vaccine.
You can't do that.
Stop it now or I will stop it.
You stop it... or everyone dies.
I'm sorry.
I didn't.
mean to scare you.
Nothing.
Not a damn thing.
I came here looking for evidence.
Evidence that you'd lied to me... that you had loyalties other than.
I didn't find anything Diana.
But something found me.
Fate.
Destiny.
Whatever it's called when you... when you realize.
You were being paid a visit by young Jeffrey Spender's father.
The.
Because there's nothing to be done.
And at some point, you just.
That's where it all begins. That's where we need to be if we want.
Hey, Scully. It's me.
I'm with Diana.
No. We're coming to get you.
You're coming with us.
Cassandra's gone, Scully.
Scully, it's no use.
Going where?
Who gave you this information?
All right.
I'm going to send you on ahead.
This may be our last chance to stop them.
Turn around.
Turn around, Scully.
I think this is him.
Our lives are in danger.
We don't have much time.
If somebody overheard us, it might create mass panic.
El Rico Air Base.
I've had answers for years.
No one would ever listen.
They burned themselves.
With a choice made long ago by a.
It means the future is here, and all bets are off.
Yeah.
Someone forgot to throw away the key.
Donnie Pfaster is a death fetishist... a collector of bone and dead.
Sick would describe him.
We found women's fingers in his.
Just women.
Been five years in here thinking about only that.
Case closed.
Didn't look at the file, did you?
Not a man.
Donnie Pfaster.
And he didn't just.
That's why I'm here.
I don't know about.
The man abducted you.
Donnie Pfaster did a number on your.
Well, this isn't the first incident.
Two prisoners have escaped.
Dozens of witnesses, guards, and staff, and no one seems to.
No, neither of the men have ever been seen again.
Yes, but I'm still a little confused.
Maybe you could go over it.
Then I know you'll tell me the truth.
You and Donnie Pfaster were in the garment shop at or about.
Yeah, but you had something happen.
You had an incident.
You cried out to the guards that you'd cut your hands.
Others saw them, too.
How do you explain that?
Post-hypnotic suggestion.
Did you see him?
A programmed behavior prompted and manifested by suggestion.
Doesn't work on you.
Group hypnosis.
Mesmer was able to hypnotize and command entire audiences.
I'm not saying that it was Donnie.
Three inmates are missing from three separate prisons.
One.
Barely.
Well, I think if it was a make out song I think it'd.
Was he here?
We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect.
Well, something happened here, huh?
The Good Reverend.
How do you do?
Well, this delivery arrived a little late... a little late and a little.
Blood of the lamb, Reverend.
Handiwork of Mr. Donnie Pfaster....
Where is he, Reverend?
No. Donnie was supposed to die.
You were supposed to kill him.
When God spoke to you, Reverend, did He happen to mention.
To prove that man's a liar.
God is a spectator, Scully.
He just reads the box scores.
You think God directs that man?
You think He directs him to kill?
So, what?
You think that God directs him to... let the prisoners.
Well, plenty of nut bags do.
Has he ever spoken to you?
What did he say?
What does it mean?
What?
Hmm...
So, what do you think that God is telling you?
Well, all right.
Come with me, Scout.
I'll show you how the.
It's a cerebral edema.
Except this isn't accidental.
The cause, in fact, as it was.
Yeah. My guess is he-he probably did it when he first got into.
There's a theory that at this point in human evolution our mental.
The practitioners of this found that they could perform certain.
Yeah, but maybe they can alter perception of it creating a.
Donnie Pfaster is serving a life sentence without possibility of.
I don't know.
Maybe he unleashed something that he couldn't.
Marshal?
Marshal?
He's gone, Scully.
Let's go, Scully.
What is it?
Did you tell him?
Oh, he must have...
overheard us when we were talking in the.
I'm sure you did.
Well... maybe this was meant for you.
Don't look any further.
You know, it's funny, when all is said and done, there's...
What do you mean?
I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his.
This X-File is over... lying dead there in a grave he dug himself.
This is Fox Mulder.
Leave a message after the...
Excuse me.
If you want to pack some things, we can get out of here.
You can't judge yourself.
The Bible allows for vengeance.
The way I see it... he didn't give you a.
What's that?
You mean if it was God? I'm looking for the agent in charge.
Special Agent Mulder. Mrs. Jacobs? I'm Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI. We're going to do everything we can to find her. I know you must be feeling... Fox Mulder. Any leads on a suspect? The neighbors? No, I bet that he didn't know her so well or else he What about this woman at the restaurant? Yeah, that's why I came down here. Mind if I talk to her? Great. Thanks.
I thought you missed your flight. I forgot it. I left in kind of a hurry. Yeah, 15 year old girl, Amy Jacobs was taken from her No. They haven't found her. A 30-year-old woman named Lucy Householder was.
Technically, but whether she That's my name, isn't it? Turns out, Lucy Householder Lucy? I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. A young girl was kidnapped last night. Have you heard Do you remember what you were saying last night when You were saying Nobody's going to spoil us. Those were the exact words spoken by the kidnapper No. We just want to find the little girl any way we can, All right, well thanks for talking to us, Lucy. No, we can't hold you here. You're free to go. Yeah. I'm working on it. It doesn't surprise me given her history. I don't think she's involved.
No. Let me follow up on that, okay? What? Yeah? How could it be Amy Jacobs' blood? Lucy was all the Why? Because it matches the victim's blood type?
Lucy is a victim, Scully, What are you talking about?
Will you do me a favor? ‘Cause I don't want Lucy Householder treated like a How's she doing? Thanks. What do you say, Lucy? Can I take you to dinner? You feeling better? Better than Amy Jacobs? If anybody knows, I'd say you do. How'd you scratch your face?
Are you using again, Lucy? Have you ever experienced temporary blindness before? That girl's in trouble, Lucy. I think you can, Lucy. Well, that's something you have to tell me. Lead us to her. Well, that's too bad, Lucy, because right now I think Scully, take a look at this. Yeah. Taken in 1978, the week she was found. She'd What is it? Who's the photographer? What have you got on him? Have you shown this picture to Amy's little sister? I'm going to take it and show it to Lucy. Lucy? Lucy, wait. I just want to ask you a question. Lucy, wait a second. I'm sorry. I just want to show you a photograph, okay? You recognize him don't you? Lucy. Lucy? He's probably changed a lot over the last 17 years. I want you to tell me what you're going through. You can actually feel what she's going through, can't you? Lucy, she needs your help. Lucy....
Wait here a second, okay? What's going on? Why? What the hell is happening? She didn't do it, Scully. She was just here. You're going to drive her away with this. A half a dozen witnesses placed her across town at the Well, then trust me on this. She's not working with Wade. She may have bled it. Yes. It may explain why there was so little of it on the.
He's wrong, Scully. I'm protecting her because I think she's connected to.
Carl Wade? Why would she be After five years in a dark pit, I'm sure she developed I don't know how to explain it, but I think that Wade's That's how I account for what Lucy's going through. Because she's afraid..
What don't I see?
You don't think I've thought of that? What about the girl? Was she with him? Which way was the car headed?
Okay, Interstate 12... county 15 north... That's where Lucy was found 17 years ago. It's a small town, Scully. Somebody's bound to.
But he's a photographer, He should have an account here. Amy?
Yeah. No. I'll take her. Come on, Lucy. What else, Lucy? Tell me what else? Lucy, you came here to help her. Why else would you come back here if not for Amy? You're the survivor. You're the strong one. Now Amy She has to make it and you have to help her. Lucy, Lucy, sit down. Sit down. They're in the water. There's a river near here. I think that's where they are. Wade lives here. He knows these woods. No, but I think that's what she's trying to do. Wade! Federal Officer! Hold it right there! She's not breathing. No pulse either. Come on, Amy, breathe.
Damn it, Amy, come on! How's Amy? How serious were her injuries? He must have dragged her through the woods for at Did they finish up on Lucy? She drowned, didn't she? She saved Amy's life. I think she died for more than Amy. I think finally, it was... the only way she could escape. I don't know, Scully, the man's vanished. He hasn't been Chicken chase.
They may think they are, but on the night George Kearns Folktales dating back to the 19th century from the Ozarks Well, most legends don't leave behind 12-foot burn marks. I thought so too. Until I remembered this.
Unh, I was young.
His name was Creighton Jones. He pulled That's a witch's peg. Staking it into the ground is supposed We're with the FBI. I'm Special Agent Mulder. This is Why didn't you mention this witch's peg in your report? What about the scorched area? So you don't believe it's foxfire?
This inspection report... your husband He never discussed his work with you? Well, he cited several major health violations. Let me give you my phone number. If your husband tries What's that? Chickens feed on chickens? If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become I'm not so sure about that..
Let him go. We're federal agents What about you, Dr. Randolph? Do you have any ideas? But you can tell us whether George Kearns came to you Mr. Chaco? It is, but we suspect that might have something to do with We're not sure yet, but it's possible they may have both.
What am I looking at? Why didn't this show up on any of her charts? Could this be the reason she attacked Jess Harold? Is it fatal? Except that Paula Gray was no girl. This is her personnel Let's find out. Her birth certificate should be on file at...A lot more likely than Paula Gray being three years Call an ambulance. I'll try to get the driver out. You're saying this is a third victim of Creutzfeldt-Jacob? Ooh, I'm listening. So anyone eating chickens out of Dudley would be at risk? Yeah, but chickens from Dudley are shipped all over the Sheriff Arens? What's wrong with this water? Was this river searched after George Kearns disappeared? Well, I'd like it dragged as soon as possible. To see what's in there. Hopefully nothing. Look, Sheriff Arens, if you don't want to do it I can get Oh, it's just a hunch. If George Kearns didn't run off, Did you find Kearns? Sheriff Arens is outside. They're still pulling bones from How do you know? What about the others? Well, they seem to have lost their heads.
It's almost like they've been polished. No. That water had hardly any current and this level of Maybe. I had Danny run a check on all missing persons last seen Scully, I think the good people of Dudley have been eating Look at these bones. They've been polished at both That could begin to explain her youthful appearance. Some cannibalistic rituals are enacted with a belief Think about it, Scully. From vampirism to Catholicism, The records at the courthouse should tell us how old she Someone's been playing with matches. I bet it's no coincidence it only hit the birth records.
Mulder.
Are you all right?
Who?
All right, Mrs. Kearns, I want you to stay To take Chaco into custody. Is Mr. Chaco in? Do you know what's in here? Can you open it?
Scully, Chaco's not here.
Chaco must have taken her.
Scully? Scully! Scully!
Are you all right? Answer me! SCULLY!!
Are you hurt? You all right? Drop your weapon! I said... I said put it down! You okay, Scully? Get his gun. Now, I want an explanation. Your cigarette-smoking friend killed my father for that tape, I was a dead man. Now, I'm back. Defense department files that weren't supposed to exist. The Give her the tape. Then you better make sure it doesn't. There are truths out there that aren't on that tape. Scully, whatever you're going to say... How did you know? That's my father on the left there. About 1973. Our deal with the devil. The U.S. government provided safe haven I don't know. Do you recognize anybody else in the photograph? You're going to have to wait a little longer for my video collection, Scully... You can't go. If they're trying to kill you, that's the first place they're We're going to call someone I think can help. It's the only Victor Klemper? My name is Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully. Yes. I think you knew my father. When you came to this country, you did some work for our government. Like my father. They killed him and I believe you know why. Well, what is this work that my father was involved in? Well, you knew him! Was he a murderer too? No, I need to know! I need to know the truth! Isn't that what Let's go, Scully. I don't know. He never came home wearing a miner's cap. I'd like to try door number one, Monty. Sure that's the right number? I think with a crowbar and a small nuclear device, I might be I'm okay, Scully... Of what? Lots of files. What's in these files? What is this? Do all these files contain the same materials? What year was this person born? What year were you born? Let's go find 1964. Dana Katherine Scully. I don't know, Scully. Yeah. I don't know. Wait here, Scully. Scully! Scully! You okay, Scully? I've been looking for you. They got a small army outside. I think they got us trapped. You'd be surprised what's not on the map in this country and Last night, we were chased by some kind of hit squad driving No, sir. I need that tape. I need those files. And I'm talking about an elaborate conspiracy against the American Locked inside a mountain vault. I don't know. But the answer's got to be on that tape, in those It's obviously worth killing us for. Why they killed my father... and what happened to my sister... What makes you think there's any such thing as justice, Scully? What we found last night... I suppose you already tried to make a backup of the tape. What makes you think they'll even honor this deal? It's up to you, Scully. I'm sorry about your sister, Scully. Mister Klemper? Mister Klemper? You killed him, didn't you? You were involved in this project. You know why the medical Klemper was trying to create an alien-human hybrid. That's what My father was involved in this? He collected those files? The vaccination records. They took tissue from everyone who So that Victor Klemper had access to a DNA database of nearly Why was your file there, Scully? There were current records on file. Of abductions! Of abductees. Why her? Why not me? Why are you telling me this? Is there more? Yeah. It's after two. I needed to see you in person. I need to ask you something. Mom, listen to me. When Samantha... before she was gone, did Mom, did he ever ask you to make a choice? Mom, listen to me! I need to know! Did he make you make a choice? Oh, she knows. Melissa knows. I don't think this is about justice, Scully. I think it's about something we have no personal choice in. I feel the same way. We've both lost so much... but I believe Concentrate on this area, over here. Right there. I'm not sure I can explain, Scully. Just give me a minute, Scully, okay? I keep having this dream. It's about a little blond girl. I've had... flashes of it, three nights in a row. And last night, I know what happened here. She was strangled. He used an eight-gauge No. I know this M.O. I know it from memory. John Lee Roche. He killed thirteen eight-to-ten year-old girls. It was a difficult case, he was extremely hard to catch. I concluded that, that we were probably looking for a salesman. We never found them, but we didn't need them to make the case. So you think that I've somehow had this information about a 1975 is too early. That would mean Roche started way before we thought he did. Yes, sir, and he won't get out. It's not a good job. Sir? Roche's car... Roche drove a white El Camino, Scully. I saw The cloth hearts he collected, he would have wanted to keep Well, he doesn't have them in prison, the cell is searched regularly, Not by me. Helping him detail. Mad Hat... Eight... nine, ten... eleven, twelve... thirteen, fourteen... He had two more victims. Agent Scully. We found Addie Sparks, John. Sixteen victims, John. How come you only said there were only Why don't you tell us about your last two victims, then? You can gain one moment of decency in your life. You can finally Samantha... The Magician comes on at nine. They're next door at the Galbrands'. They left me in charge. Samantha! Yesterday, you said something about me taking it personally. November. Twenty-seventh of November. Do you know what I'm getting What do you know about my sister? He was there, Scully. He was in the house. He took Samantha. A dream is an answer to a question we haven't yet figured out Well, how would he find out about that? Looking for what? My last dream came true. Scully, do you believe that my sister I don't know. I don't know what happened. I don't know what Mom, I'm in the basement. Do you recognize... these fabrics? Either one of them? Just look closely. Do... do they seem familiar to you? Just familiar. Have you seen them before? It's all right. Dad never bought you a vacuum cleaner, did he? Where is it? Sir? I've been denied further access to John Lee Roche. I've Sir... I have reason to believe he can tell us what happened to my I need to know. I just need to speak with him one more time, No. You don't get to touch them. They stay in the bag. Name How could you know what I said? If that's true, tell me where my sister is. What? Help me, Scully. It's not her, Scully. Am I right? Samantha broke her collarbone It's somebody, though. If that's true, tell me where. You just want to get out of here. This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the F.B.I. Keep your hands in your lap. Excuse me. Excuse me, I have to get by. Now! Go. Where'd they go? Go on. And then what did you do? That's exactly how it happened? Right here in this room? Wrong house. No. No, but I think I know what happened. Somehow you got inside I profiled you. I got inside your head, maybe you got inside And you're in the wrong house, you stupid son of a bitch! You Yeah, but you remember all the other details so vividly. That's You must have been one hell of a salesman, Roche. First flight's He must have done it in my sleep, I had another dream. He took the last cloth heart. I don't. Yeah. Where's your phone? Yeah, please put me through to your supervisor. This is Fox Mulder of the F.B.I. I'd like a passenger manifest It's not your fault. It's my fault. None of that really matters now, does it? There's no reason for that, he knows we're going to catch him. Try to relive some past glory? Is that what you're thinking? He's there. Alice, Alice in Wonderland, he's the Mad Hatter. That's where he got the idea in the first place. He never brought anyone here. Are you okay, Caitlin? Caitlin, can you do me a favor? Can you count to twenty? Can Don't make this end badly. How? All this conjecture - the ontological shock that you speak of, for No, I don't think she's lying. I think that if you prepare people well No. I just question mindless belief. What I've seen, I've seen because I wanted to believe. I... Dr. Werber? Almost five years. A lot has changed. Well, I've come to distrust a lot of things. I've - I've come to distrust For what? I'm not questioning your methods, Dr. Werber. I'm questioning I don't think you understand. There's just too much evidence that Yeah. Is Patient X any more credible? Hi. I am? You may not like me as much as you like that story. How's that? Cassandra... Cassandra? Are you here voluntarily? Whatever it is that you're afraid of, I suggest that you check yourself The man you're talking about died because of what he believed in. Cassandra... there was a time when I would've believed what you're I'm not. Do I look like I'm having fun, Scully? That makes sense. I've had my head up my rear end for the last Cassandra Spender is living proof that the truth I've so boldly sought One more anal-probing, gyro-pyro levitating-ectoplasm alien How do you know about Cassandra Spender? Great. You know, you try to reveal what's hidden, you try to incite people Yeah, and still nobody believes me. What? The woman is a nut, Scully. Where the government no doubt removed her brain. Isn't that what Wish granted. Are there any survivors? From the smell... Any preliminary theories? Self-immolation? And what was their relationship to each other? Were they families? And you think it's related to your abduction from the same place? You think this is some kind of abduction scenario? Do you have any evidence of that? That's what I'm asking you. No. I'm going to give you an explanation. You knew them? What would you like me to do? Stop who? Oh, son of... the prophet. There you have it. I'm sorry. We won't be bothering you or your mother anymore. Are you ready for this? I've been going over the initial forensics That's how I found these - small pieces of what looks like metal I followed up with the families of the three victims and I found Take a look. The implants triggered those responses. Those people were led By the same government that put the implant in you, to function Why not? A tracking system using military app satellite I don't know that yet. Mulder. Yes? Yes. No. Where are you? Marita? Mar... Who's this? This is Fox Mulder. I'm actually looking for Agent Scully. I haven't been able to What are you talking about? Gone where?
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
Is anything the matter?
Mmm.
Then what's wrong?
Don't make me guess.
Scully, there's, um, there's something I haven't told you either and I hope.
During my investigation into your illness I found out the reason why you.
I took them directly to a specialist who would tell me if they were okay.
Scully, you were deathly ill, and I... I couldn't bear to give you another.
The doctor said that the ova weren't viable.
Hi.
Thanks.
No, I can't stay.
I gotta get back to the office for a while.
Um, it's... it's not something that I get asked to do every day.
Um, but I am.
No, honestly.
See what's weird is... this sounds, and this sounds really weird, I know, but.
Well.
... the answer is yes..
At that part, I'm a pro.
I'm Dr. Miryum.
These are the best team of obstetricians one could hope to.
Scully?
I must have dozed off.
I was waiting for you to get back.
It didn't take, did it?
Never give up on a miracle. Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted. Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent You're a medical doctor, you teach at the academy. You did your I did. I liked it. How's your chemistry? This is the substance found in the surrounding Beats me, I've never seen it before either. I have plenty of theories. Conventional wisdom. You know this Oregon female? She's the fourth That's why they put the I in F.B.I. See you tomorrow morning, This must be the place. Yeah, the FBI got involved after the first three deaths when Mmm.
That's pretty good, Scully. Well... I'll let you know when we get past the easy part. We won't know that until we do a little gravedigging. I've arranged Oh, you know... probably nothing. Yeah, hi. How soon can we get started? Oh great. Were you able to arrange for a, uh... an examination facility? Ah... I'm sorry, you are... Surely, you must have been informed of our intentions to come Oh, oh. Well, that answers the question that we had. Why you Guy obviously needed a longer vacation. Soames actually confessed to the first two murders. He pleaded Missing for only seven hours in July. How does a twenty-year-old Really? This is amazing, Scully. You know what this could mean? It's If it's not human, what is it? Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames' grave? Try telling What we can't do here, we'll order to go. We can do those x-rays here, can't we? Is there any reason we Steven Spielberg. You figure out what that little thing up Ray Soames' nose is Is that something you've seen before? We're trying to find a connection in these deaths. Did you treat Does he like it when you read to him? Doctor. I'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam on No one is going to hurt you! What's his name, er... Billy said he was sorry he didn't get I don't know, lucky guess? Why? So you can put it down in your little report? I don't think The truth? I think those kids have been abducted. By what. Do you have a better explanation? Nothing scientific, you mean. Hold on! This is a crime scene. What's he doing out here all by himself? I don't know. Is it a campfire? Yeah, I'm just, er... We lost power, brakes, steering, everything. Nine minutes. I looked at my watch just before the flash and Gone! Just like that. Not in this zip code. Hi. Come on in. Mosquito bites. Yeah. I got eaten up a lot myself out there. You're shaking. Take your time. Tore the family apart. No one would talk about it. There were Eventually, I went off to school in England, I came back, got At first, it looked like a garbage dump for UFO sightings, alien There's classified government information I've being trying Someone at a higher level of power. The only reason I've been You're a part of that agenda, you know that. I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know, because The government knows about it, and I got to know what they're What happened? She was running? On foot? Let's go, let's go. F.B.I. Damn it! The x-rays and pictures! Come with us. How long has it been happening? Your father's the medical examiner. You were the one on the Why? Do you have the marks, Theresa? I don't think she wants to leave. You're Billy Miles' father? Eh, you gotta love this place. Everyday's like Halloween. They know something. Why would they destroy evidence? What would they want with that Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves. They're both empty. I think I know who did it. I think I know who killed Karen Swenson. The detective's son. Billy Miles. Peggy O'Dell was bound to a wheelchair but she ran in front Yes. Peggy O'Dell was killed at around nine-o'clock, that's That's the reason the kids come to the forest, because the forest Yes, but it was Billy Miles who took her there, summoned by We're going to pay a visit to Billy Miles. I guess you changed his bedpan last night. You noticed nothing unusual? Do you remember what you were doing Do you remember what you were watching? Do you know who was taking care of Peggy O'Dell last night? Thank you for your time, ma'am. Good day. Scully... You're sure? Okay, then maybe we should take it and run a lab test... All right, but I just want you to understand what it is you're Yeah, but you have to write it down in your report. There were screams... You know it's Billy. You've known it all along. How long are you gonna let it happen? Scully. It was incredible. Scully? It's me, I haven't been able to sleep. I talked to the Yeah? Anything up? Something interesting came into my attention last night. A French Using the national weather service satellite system, I was able Yeah, that's where the boat we know as The Talapus pulled up Look Scully, I don't know what it is but something is still So why all the attention paid to this site? What information I would but the entire crew is being treated for radiation burns. The French government is keeping that information classified I checked. It's thousands of miles away from any test sites. Well that's why I'm in the basement Scully. Is that what you think of me? Well that's good because there's some garbage in San Diego I Dr Seizer? Special agent Mulder. This is agent Scully. Yeah, how are they doing? Not on this planet. How could that be? With that level of radiation, how could one Could it be possible for us to talk to him? Try the INS or the French Consulate, see what you can pull up Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI. Have you turned anything up? The crew of this ship is being treated for radiation. So it's ok for us to go on board? Feels like home. No, I'm looking for the vcr. The dive suit has a video camera. Looks like the fuselage of a plane. I just got very turned on. Would it have been carrying anything radioactive? Then what was it those men exposed to? Mr Gauthier?
Mr Gauthier? open the door, it's the FBI. Mr Gauthier? I want you to lie still. I'm with the FBI. What How did you get here? The Piper Maru? That's the last thing you remember? Do you know where you are? Yeah. Nobody else's home, but somebody has been going over your papers. She's not here, look. you need to be careful, you have some I want you to remain calm, ok? I'd like to ask you a few questions Well, somebody did. And I think you know why. My name is Mulder, I'm with the FBI. I'm looking for Mr Kalenchuk. Maybe you can tell me where I could find him. Well I've got a letter here typed on his stationary.
Maybe Mulder. Ok well, why don't you have him call me as soon as he can. Yes, what did you say your name was? Thank you Geraldine.
Mulder. San Francisco airport, where are you? What? Says who? That was the name we saw written on that dive chart right? Why if they knew about it, why wait 50 years to try to recover Why don't you try to find out? I gotta go to Hong Kong. Yeah, look, uh. I'm gonna miss my flight, Is this seat taken Miss Kalenchuk? Geraldine Kalenchuk, isn't I noticed you flew 1st class, must be good money selling classified How much for the location of that P-51 Mustang you sold the Actually I'd rather know who sold you the secret. Why did you run off to Hong Kong? To sell him what? Oh your buyer's a woman. Actually you know it is my damn business because whatever you're I just did it, now let's make a deal. You gave up your civil rights when you committed treason. Open it.
Pardon Krycek. I thought guns were against the law here. Why don't you take that gun and shoot yourself in your head It's no way to treat your business partner, especially since Damn.
That's for your partner.
Now you tell me. Oh yeah? Then who was it? Either way Krycek you're a liar. I want that digital tape. Like hell you don't, it contains the secrets you were selling Obviously, you found a way. Where is it? You put that tape in my hands and we'll talk about it. Feel better? Scully, do you think it's too soon to get my own 1-900 No. It had something called hypertrichosis lanuginosa. Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation two years ago.
Mmm. Why do you say that? Well, I don't think this has anything to do with alien.
The Great Mutato You think baloney would be more effective? I'm not humoring them, Scully. This is a very serious For the purpose of what? I am alarmed that you would reduce these people to a cultural But nonetheless, unverifiable, and therefore true in the Shh. I don't know. I lost it. There. Up there. We're with the FBI. Your father. What is the Homeotic Hox gene?
Why would you do that? Could that be done in humans? But could it be done?
Good night, Dr. Frankenstein. That's not what I just heard. Well, then why do them at all? But, given the power, who could resist the temptation I -I'd just like some coffee, thanks. Do you own a tape recorder, Izzy? That's the same voice we heard out in the woods last night.
To messenger this to the Bureau. Something recorded its voice on this, Scully. When Victor Frankenstein asks himself Whence did Who else would go to such trouble to impregnate Shaineh Mrs. Berkowitz said in her letter that when she saw her Dr. Pollidori. Is there something you'd like to I'm accusing that your wife may have been impregnated. Oh, I think you know.
Scully? The other victims, they had their frying pans... violated.
I think we found our smoking gun.
Not a problem.
What's this?
Sure. Whoa! That's not a place you want to burn a guy. They unmasked the monster. Used by who? Is there someone registered locally? We may be too late. I think we are. Who are you? What's your business here? It's alive. Whatever you have in mind, I'm going to have to ask you Hey, Scully. Look at this. You're going to have to come out of there. I hope not.

Well some very grown up cryptozoologist believed it could be A plesiosaur, actually. Though admittedly, there's not a lot Well how many folk tales do you know that could eat a boy scout Check this out, Scully. We're looking for the Lake View Cabins. Flipper Road? Fine.
What are they saying? About Big Blue? What kind of stories? What about you? Do you believe those stories? So you think Big Blue's responsible for what's been happening? Have you ever actually seen it? It's Scout Woolsley. The boy scout troop leader. Are you insinuating something? Still doesn't explain why half of him is still missing. Looks What do you mean?

Twenty feet from shore, and twice in one day? What about Ted Bertram? Oh, is that the psychological approach to crime solving? He's This roll's been exposed, can you get that developed?

Hey Scully, you think you could ever You've lost some weight recently haven't you? Though it is amazing what some animals will do to guarantee Why did you name your dog Queequeg? It's a bizarre name for a dog, huh? Scully, are you coming on to me? You know, it's interesting you should say that, because I've No, flippant is my favourite line from Moby Dick.

Nice to meet you, sir.
Come on, Scully.
You act like I intentionally misled you.
Over.
Well, if that's true... if Daryl Mootz is controlling the weather.
Yeah, but how many scapegoats lease office space?
Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.
We want to see the king.
Well, when you say on business you mean he's making it rain?
This, uh, TV station... is that far.
It's like looking in a mirror.
Well, from what I've read about Kroner you've had more than your.
No, no, um... What about the rain?
I have a list of over 40.
According to his schedule the King should have been here by now.
How do you explain your unique ability?
Try me.
I watch the Weather Channel.
Well, this is not without historical precedent.
The Old West was.
Scully, I don't think it's a coincidence that a cow gets hurled at.
I'm telling you, that cow had my name on it.
Are you saying that you're somehow responsible for the...
What's your connection to Daryl Mootz?
And ever since then, the rain's been following him.
No.
I can tell you without a doubt that you're not responsible for.
Agent Scully and I specialize in these types of cases and-and-and.
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm sure.
Scully, you have any doubts?
You see?
You're welcome.
What are you talking about?
Look at this, Scully.
September 20, 1991, it.
She's not. Neither is Daryl.
Check this out... on the same day that.
Holman Hardt is manufacturing the weather.
Did you see how.
Most people will admit that the weather plays a significant role in.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Well, who's to say that it doesn't work the other.
Hey, Holman.
I've come to say good-bye, Holman.
Yeah.
But I want you to get some help before you kill somebody.
You know what I'm talking about.
You're not just a weatherman.
I don't think it works that way.
I don't think you don't do it on.
And whatever it is, you got to let it out.
Yeah, you can.
It's Sheila, isn't it?
You love.
And you've never told her the way you feel?
Well, you better tell her or you're going to kill somebody.
I got a plane to catch.
I am meeting my partner at the airport.
Excuse me. Hold on.
Mulder.
I'm on my way.
Fog?
Holman!
Yeah... he wants advice.
Dating advice.
Yours truly.
Hello?
Hey.
I will talk to you later.
This is about you, Holman.
I'm here to help you.
I'm perfectly.
Just tell her how you feel.
And Holman.
I do not gaze at Scully.
Well?
Oh, you did it.
What are you talking about?
Hey!
Hey, Daryl.
Cut it out, man.
Daryl.
Scully, do you.
What does red mean?
Looks like we're not going to be able to catch our plane.
If she's here, he'll be here.
Come on, Holman, now make it stop.
My fault?
Yes, he was.
Tell her, Holman.
I'll build the ark, you gather the animals.
I was kidding.
Where's your leg?
You might want to take a look at the king... make sure he's all.
I didn't know reunions could be so...
Well, how'd it go? Gary Kane, 16 years old, High School Junior. C student, first-string Nobody knows. The victim received a phone call and left his home. He was discovered No. The other victims have had to be sedated and hospitalized since One in eastern Wisconsin, one three towns away. The local sheriff in Delta Glen, Wisconsin thinks he knows what's He thinks they've been possessed. Probably went over big with the local ranchers. They're walk-ins. They're believers in soul transference, enlightened spirits Which parts are those? When you say spirit, Gary, I'm not sure what you mean. And you don't remember who called you? Do you have any reason to believe that they may be involved Scully, we'll meet you outside. Has this boy ever been in any trouble? Yeah. You see a noticeable difference in him? The Red Museum... how are they treated by the local citizens? Well, are they ever singled out? Shop owners refusing to sell Uh, can you recommend a good motel in the area? Well, I, I want to run a background check on the church and Well, it, it's kind of a new age religion based on an old idea. A new enlightened spirit. According to the literature, Abe Lincoln No. Not even they want to claim Nixon. I don't know. In the absence of any other plausible explanation... Really? I think the sperm posse just rode into town. Hey, leave him alone! You got a problem? I see four against one. I got a problem. Who's your dad? Yeah, I think he would like to hear about this. Yeah, Eddie, this is all good stuff. Yeah, see what else you What'd you find? Is that the stuff they use for motion sickness? Is it a controlled substance? I'll drive. I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder. We're with the Federal Bureau Richard Odin? We'd like to ask you some questions. May we come inside? Well, how's that? We can always determine that elsewhere. Can you step outside, Just answer the question, Mister Odin. Do your religious beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge, Sheriff...I've already had to go through this once with your You know, for a holy man, you've got quite a knack for pissing In what way? The growth hormone. Did you know him? Looks like the doctor may have been delivering more than babies. Any clue what this is about? Well, wherever he was coming from, I'd say that was one hell Scully? You're not going to believe this. Yeah, the print-outs we found in the briefcase were mostly shipping I don't know. Maybe to track them the way credit card companies What was he treating them with? I know that was the first thing through both of our minds, Scully, Gary was never sick. Did you ever take Gary to another doctor? Excuse me? What is this? This light here. There's something back there. Looks like somebody's private little movie studio. What is it? What? That's quite a video library you've compiled for yourself. I No. No, men who know they're sick try to get help. You just Did you kidnap those kids? Are you prepared to confess to those crimes? And to the murders of Rick Mazeroski and... Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski? Answer the question. Is this how you express your love for them? Why? What'd he become? You're not making any sense. Now, you... make sense to me. Okay, what tests? What do you mean, using you? With growth hormone? So you're saying that Doctor Larson was paying you a lot of Was Doctor Larson involved in the kidnapping? Mm-hmm? Well, how can you be sure? Do you know what you're saying, Scully? He's been injecting those kids with alien DNA. But it's the same substance we found in the Erlenmeyer flask, It all makes sense. The money in the briefcase, they've been No. He's just some poor soul who blew their cover. I don't think What? Well, whoever's behind this, he's here covering their tracks. Where's Gary? Go pack some clothes, things you need. You're all coming with I'll explain later. I need your help. It may offend your religious sensibilities but it could help Stop right there! Hey! Yes... Who are you?
Who are you?! Did they give... Agent Scully this disease? Did they do this Back away! Mulder tries to stomp out the fire. Mulder Keep going, FBI woman. It was too crowded in my apartment, I couldn't sleep. Good, cuz neither am I. There's a dead man on the floor of my Apparently somebody thinks my life is interesting enough to Yeah, he works... he worked for the Department of Defense. Gunshot wound to the face. I can't do that, Scully, I can't go to the authorities with This man, Osterhoff, worked for the military. Are you beginning This hoax, your cancer, everything! It just doesn't lead back This man, Osterhoff, was set up in the apartment directly above Yeah. I don't know. Maybe since the beginning, since you joined me on the X-Files. There are those who can be trusted. What I need to know is who No, but as they lie to us, we can lie to them. A lie to find Through the front door. You knew my apartment was being surveilled. How? Someone at the FBI is involved, this man Osterhoff, was in contact I found it on a dead man. Level 4 clearance, that means I get to dine at the officer's I need to know who did this to Scully! What? The cure for Scully's cancer? What am I looking for? DNA from whom? But what does all this have to do with flying saucers? Germ warfare. We were accused of using it in the Korea. What about all the reports of abductions? You're saying they've But I've seen aliens. I've witnessed these things. Then why a hoax? Why create hard evidence, an alien body that Scully would have known. You went along with all this. You let them do this to Scully. You believe there's a cure for him in here, too. I had come here looking for answers hoping not only to lay bare If Agent Scully and I had been led to believe that the conspiracy What? What is it? Can you help me? I'm looking for a woman... I will calm down when someone gives me a reason to calm down. Yes. Well, where is she? Where is that? Where is she? ICU. I'm only half dead. What happened to her? Due to what?
Do to what?! Let go of me.
Get the hell off of me!
Are you suggesting that I can? Help myself, how? That helps you, how doesn't that help me? Are we finished then? Thanks, buddy. You should have mentioned that at the hospital when you were That's a good place to lay it, considering her condition. How can you help me? The disease she has was given to her by somebody connected to I failed to find that out, sir. I heard you were being moved out of the ICU, that you were feeling It's okay.
I did not come here to talk about that. Well, there's not much to talk about anyway, I'm going to testify No. But that doesn't matter now. Hey, Scully, how about those Yankees, huh? Yeah, Skinner's withholding it. I don't believe that. No, not Skinner. But if I don't testify now they'll start to bury the truth. I can....
I can't do that. Hi, Mrs. Scully. No. I was just on my way out. I'm sorry about your sister. Yeah? Please tell me you're here with severe chest pains. Go to hell. What are you talking about? What I found was useless. He promised me it would be in here. It may be for Scully's. Shortly after she was abducted she discovered a small metallic Watch your language, Frohike, and grab me some tweezers. Crazy in what sense? In that it might save your sister's life? This is not science fiction. Would she have to stop her conventional treatment? If it works, I don't care what you think she thinks. Why is that, because I don't think the way you think? Because No... In a way, I think I do. I lost someone very close to me. I lost One sorry son of a bitch speaking. Yes. There still is. You could say that, yeah. I'll keep that in mind. I think that's my sister. Who? Who told you that? Why? But you called that man your father? But you knew who your father was? And you believed that. You don't remember anything about that night? I can help you. You were abducted, Samantha, I can help you Then why come here at all? What you've been told... I want you to listen to me, okay? Because the man that brought you here has known where I've been I don't know, but I think he's kept a lot of things from you. Then I want you to come with me, come with me to see Mom. Yes. And I know she'd like to see you very much. Why not? No, please, don't go. Alright, just tell me how I can find you. Just... just tell me where to find you. We will do this on your time, just... What do you want from me? You give me these things, the only things I ever wanted and I know the truth. I spoke to one of your men. I've seen enough to know he's not a liar, yeah. What more can you show me? What are you saying? In exchange for what? No deal. What have... what have you given me? A claim of a cure for You murdered my father, you killed Scully's sister, and if Scully Where did you get that? Why am I here? The man was spying on me. I refuse to believe that. Can you show it to me? Name Skinner and save myself? I'll see you at the hearing. Good morning. Yeah. I came by last night, but I... I didn't have the heart I was lost last night. But as I stood here, I thought I'd found It doesn't matter, I'm not taking the deal, I'm not taking any Section Chief Blevins directed me to implicate Skinner. To name No. Yeah, they have evidence against me, they know I killed that Scully, I can't let you take the blame. Because of your brother.
Because I knew you'd talk Have the Father say a few Hail Mulders for me, okay? Sorry I'm late. Respectfully, Sir. I've come here today to set the record straight I'm... ready to proceed please sir. Four years ago, while working on an assignment outside the FBI She did lied because I asked her to. Because I had evidence AND a conspiracy intended to destroy the lives of those who I will answer I will answer that question, Sir. I will answer the question after I name the man! I will answer that question after I name the man who's responsible I can't do that. I can't do that sir, because the Section Chief is the man I'm How? Assuming? I didn't. I just guessed. I'm sure whatever connections there were, they're being erased Not everything.
Scully's cancer's gone into It's the best news I could have ever heard. I don't know. I don't think we'll ever know. Yeah, she's in there with her family right now, but I'm sure.
Is that a lot?
We could start sharing rooms.
You can't really compare what we do to other departments in the Bureau.
Well, there's more to it than that.
That's the reason I got started, yeah.
Nothing has been resolved exactly.
Yeah.
You said you were finished.
I'm missing your point.
That sounds more like a threat.
I can't do my job from an office, I promise you.
I'm not looking in outer space.
To where?
I think I'm in big trouble.
Yeah, but I never actually assaulted an auditor before.
I reduced his vision a little bit.
Mulder.
Speaking.
Oregon, seven years ago.
You had multiple abduction experiences.
I'm.
It happening again, Billy?
More alien abductions, Scully.
We'd probably turn up nothing.
Look who's wearing a badge.
You've never, um...
have you ever been able to get over the abductions?
Does he deny that it's happening now?
You find the UFO and he won't be able to deny the truth.
Crash of an unidentified craft.
Deja vu all over again.
To mark an anomalous electrical disturbance... the kind where time gets.
So, was the deputy's car up there sitting there without his lights on?
Good point.
Probably nothing.
Nothing's all you seem to find out here, Detective.
You're Teresa?
Theresa Nemman?
Seven years ago you came to Agent Scully and I for help.
You were afraid.
We had no idea you were his wife.
He's an abductee, too?
Who is it?
What's wrong, Scully?
You look sick.
Come in.
You want me to call a doctor?
It's not worth it, Scully.
I want you to go home.
No, I've been thinking about it.
Looking at you tonight, holding that.
The FBI.
Maybe what they say is true, though for all the wrong reasons.
There so much more you need to do with your life.
There's so much more.
There has to be an end, Scully.
What happened, Billy?
Scully...
the floor.
What do you see?
The same thing as out on the road.
You've seen it before.
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing?
You know this guy?
Relax. Slow down.
And then what happened?
Scully?
Scully?
Scully.
You want some water?
Can you just get her some water?
Here, lie still.
It's okay. It's okay.
I don't know.
But these aren't just random abductions, Scully.
We've got to.
These abductees aren't just systematically being taken.
They're not coming.
Billy?
What's our punishment this time?
Thumbscrews or 40 lashes?
Come on in.
Guilty as charged.
And if they're coming down on you for that, then I'm.
Oh well yeah, stick to a budget they say your making a.
Well, we didn't bring home a flying saucer... or an alien.
Here or you want to step outside.
There's no ship in those woods.
Who?
Why me and why now.
If it is, or if it isn't I want you to forget about it, Scully.
You're not going back out there.
I'm not going to let you go back.
It has to end sometime.
That time is now.
Scully, you have to understand that they're taking abductees.
You're an.
.... losing you.
There's no such thing as a snipe, sir.
I know that.
Not exactly sure, sir. But, uh...
... budgetarily, I'd say we're looking pretty good. His parishioners said the Reverend Finley was bleeding from The sign bestowed by God upon the righteous. No, I think this is a case of too much faith. It's fake. Just like the others. I've been tracking a series of international religiously motivated It's a claim that's wholly unsubstantiated, though there have been Either we're dealing with a psychotic religious fanatic who's Anyway, it's safe to say this guy carries a grudge, and if I'm Thank you for contacting us so quickly. Institutionalized for what? Let me talk to you for a minute here... Mrs. Kryder? My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI. We're here because we have reason to believe that Kevin may As strange as it might sound, someone may be targeting people People exhibiting wounds that might be interpreted as having I'm sure there's an explanation, Mrs. Kryder, but right now Let's get out of here, Scully. They've taken him into custody. We've warned them about No, not yet, but my guess is that the kid did it to himself. He's in an institution. Mr. Kryder, the claims you've made for your son may have put They? These forces. What do they want? He's chosen you? Let's go. Excuse me? What color hair did he have? Was it brown, or blonde, or... How tall was he?
Was he about my height? About 6-2, 6-3? We're sorry, Mrs. Kryder. We're doing everything we can. Yeah, looks like Kevin was abducted by Homer Simpson's I think that's a safe assumption. None of the previous victims were ten year old boys. Yeah. We're not sure how accurate that is. Federal agents! Put down your weapon! Put it down right here! Where's the boy? What have you done with Kevin? Is this Kevin Kryder's blood? Did you hurt him? By who? Who asked you to protect him? God! That's quite a long distance call, isn't it? It's the end of the world as we know it, right?
And he that has a tongue, let him speak. Now tell And townsfolk wonder why I sleep in on Sunday. Sit down, Mr. Jarvis. Hey! Kevin, what is it? Any revelations? You want me to smell him? You're serious?
And now you're suggesting that this is St. Owen? Scully, those stories you're referring to are mostly regarded as This man? He was rather abnormal in life, maybe he's Do you really believe that? Even if science can't explain them? Well, I wouldn't let faith overwhelm your judgement here. It's what you turned up. Those burn marks and impressions on Jarvis's neck. They No, not yet. But I cross-checked the prints in the NCIC database. He was arrested three few years ago on a DUI - left a young Have you heard of Jerusalem Syndrome? Yeah, they return home convinced they're the Messiah, Moses.
Mulder. What? Well, how is that possible?
Hold on.
Yeah, a social worker took Is he ready to go? Did he ID Gates? That'll help. A man fitting Gates' description rented a car, You never draw my bath. He was in an accident. Maybe you missed it. What do you think it is? Scully... Sure of what exactly? That was in the Bible. It's a parable, it's a metaphor for the truth, I wait for a miracle every day. But what I've seen here has only I'll call the police. They put up a cordon in a ten-mile radius. No sign of them. Who? Why? The man's a nut case, Scully. But if Kevin is in immediate danger, even if his father has Scully? Scully. They had a sighting of Gates. He tried to rent another Scully, the man is at the airport. If he hasn't already killed You think it's you, don't you? You think you're the one who's You OK? We have a couple of hours before our flight. I told the sheriff OK. How was the wedding? Did you catch the bouquet?
The project that everyone says The next generation in jet engine design, capable of Yes. I'm not sure, but Surnow is the second scientist on the There's something unexplainable here, Scully, but it's.
Keats? Dr. Keats? We're with the FBI. I'm Agent Mulder, this is.
Who wrote this? You see, the handwriting here doesn't seem to match.
What about Roland Fuller? Well, according to the police report, he was the only Hi, Roland. Do you mind if we sit down? Thanks. You mind if we ask you a couple of questions? You like numbers, too. Would you do me a favor and try this? It's something Roland was doodling at the home. Besides Nollette and Keats, he's the only person we can Well, you saw his facility with mathematics. I don't think they'll be performing this experiment on Hey, Scully! Look at these files. KMAN, must be Keats. And worked on it for nearly 5 hours. So you're saying someone came in here, killed Keats, Try 15626. This is Arthur Grable's work on the same fluid dynamics Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts than I do. The green one?
This one? Here you go. I hear you're very good at it. You remember how you got What man? Was Dr. Grable nice to you? When was the last time you spoke to him? I'm sorry. Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable. He went to the Well, if he had intentions of killing Nollette, Keats and Maybe he staged it. That would explain why his work is.
Roland's also from Seattle.
July 15, 1952. Is that you? Cool 'do. What's the story here?
Hmmm, an egghead classic. Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 IQ is The police report on the auto accident that killed Arthur... you'll also know how to clone new bodies for them. These fluctuations in temperature - do they happen often? Is it possible the brain is causing the fluctuation? Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable had the same birthday. Same age, just less hairy and with better eyesight. Close cropped hair, with a slightly receding widow's peak. Give or take a few pounds. Why not?
Your dreams are Your dreams make you hit Tracy? You know how to work this toy, Roland? Now, you see the way you work that toy is like what's.
Have you seen.
Roland! Roland! Roland, stop!
We need He's trying to get away. Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland! Nollette's gone. We should arrange a security guard to You've got a brother, don't you Scully? Well, have you ever thought about calling one of them all I believe in psychic connections, and evidence suggests Arthur Grable is not dead. He's in a state of consciousness Well, that's a question that only Dr. Nollette can answer. We've got to find Nollette. We go this way?
Identical twins. I've read studies which suggest that in some cases the In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius and Roland's Nollette?
Arthur, how do you stop this? Tell me how! Come on, Roland. But we've recommended that he be remanded to your It's my belief that he wasn't acting under his own volition. This is the work of Arthur Grable, Roland's brother.
Uh.
There you are.
Heavy traffic?
Thoughtfully provided by the local authorities even though it.
Except that the deputy was beaten to death by an invisible.
One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing wrongfully accused.
Maybe.
Take a look at the body.
The former Deputy Ronald Foster.
As you can see, the report.
Police flashlight.
One blow.
Check out the back of his head.
Penetrated to the back of his skull.
Babe Ruth couldn't hit this.
No, his tox screen came back negative.
Uh, Sheriff Harden, this is my partner, Agent Scully.
Well, uh... we're done here.
Right?
What?
Well, Tony, this must be your lucky day for visitors.
Come on, you were cruising, right?
I mean, a small town.
Okay, but bear with us 'cause we're old and stupid.
Okay, but you didn't see anyone near the patrol car?
If you really think he's guilty, Scully, why don't you ask.
I'm not sure there was a person to see.
I don't know... some kind of territorial or spiritual entity, maybe.
Chastity, what did you and Tony talk about this morning?
How can you be so sure?
Were you there when it happened?
Chastity, if you know something now is the time to mention it.
Wow, you must be her lawyer.
Gee, butting in to our investigation.
I wonder what your father.
You got the same last name.
Back in the day.
Was this here before?
May I?
Scully, check this out.
Oh, here it comes.
Hey, Chuck.
What'd you come up with?
Buckle up, Scully.
I believe Chuck is about to take us on a ride.
That's what the gunk on the floor turned out to be.
Chuck, I get the feeling you don't know what the hell.
A shadow.
Unless it's a solid object.
You recognize these colors, Scully?
I'll show you my theory if you show me yours.
What about for these globs of goo?
Yep. I'm guessing Max Harden could tell us how they got there.
I spoke to a few students myself.
Apparently, Max was angry at.
Maybe he didn't need to.
I pulled his records.
Rising.
But what if it's given him a kind of psychokinetic or paranormal.
Yes, it is.
Soon to be proven as soon as I get Max in for.
Yeah, I want to talk to him about his son.
Max could tell them.
You know why you collapsed don't you, Max?
You think?
Smells like murder to me.
You got a problem with authority figures, don't you, Max?
No, something else.
You figured out a way to tap into.
The rush.
I think whatever it is that gives you the power to.
I don't know.
Maybe the effect's worn off.
Sir... Can we have a word outside?
If your son is in trouble I'm sure you'd want to know about it.
Anything interesting?
What is it?
What?
What would cause this?
I think I'm starting to get it.
Max Harden's personal effects.
Oh... This is it.
Those globs we found?
This is where they.
That would explain how Babbitt was killed.
It would also.
Exactly. That is, that is why his is falling apart.
Yo, Scully... How bad are his injuries?
Yeah. Delivered with this.
Max's weapon.
No, I think somebody intervened.
I think that's why the.
It's someone who knows exactly how Max does what he does.
Well, I would guess the source where Max gets his power from.
Well, maybe that's why the deputy was killed.
Yeah. 18 geologists and three semis full of gear.
Nothing.
Well, bat guano and above-normal magnetic field.
I don't know.
A vortex, like the one in Oregon.
Gravitational.
What if we're too old?
Well, you said that teenagers differ.
Yeah? Well, we can't. As of an hour ago, they pumped Spirit possession or demon possession. While these Yes, I believe we have. I've heard of it. What – What was the date of ah, Dr. Lloyd's prescription?
Wow. An addiction in other words. How many of these procedures would you say Dr. Lloyd's And not one fatality. Everybody's doing it, so I hear.
These five marks on your brand new state of the art floor? They look to me like they were burned or scorched. In the shape of a pentagram. I'm not a doctor , Scully, but you've got to be pushing It's amazing that no one saw him in time to stop him. I don't think it's just a simple possession, Scully.
Excuse me, what kind of procedure Are you aware that Dr. Lloyd is claiming he was possessed Uh huh.
Yeah. A videotape.
Which only underscores the strangeness. A sane man I don't know. A pentagram is supposed to be a symbol Yeah, but it does make sense that - that witchcraft or Maybe there is. What was that, uh, prescription No, the stomach antacid. Read me what it's made Belladonna. It's also known as Witch's Berry – that's Yeah, just one – the one Dr. Lloyd was taking.
You jest, Scully, Did you examine the victim? I found something else on the videotape. I don't know, but the orientation of the points describes That's the same prescription Dr. Lloyd was taking. It appears we've interrupted a gathering. Were any of you here at the time? Have you spoken with her? Probable cause. Probably not tax returns. I want to speak to her., I need to speak to her...
Dr, Franklyn? I came by to see if you were okay. Looks like she took a pretty good shot at you.
Nothing that a little plastic She wouldn't have known that. Ah, we have reason to believe that she's a practitioner A practicing witch. I think a lot remains to be proven.
Come in, it's open. God, you look tired. Cause of death? You ever seen anything like that? She would have died long before she yacked them up on.
Yeah, the spontaneous vomiting Well, according to this book people throughout history Rebecca Waite's house. It's the same place I got It's one of the four Greater Witches' Sabbaths, No, no, remember, I said the pentagram is a - is a protective I think she knew something about him and I think we should When is that patient scheduled? We're looking for Dr. Shannon. Mistakes? Like those patient deaths ten years There were five deaths? What was his name? Do you have a file on him? All right, I'm going to need that and the files on those Dr. Clifford Cox, birth date July 7th 1939, now can you Ten years ago, four patients died. Like the recent Maybe, maybe not. Okay, now this software was created to give patients an Vanity.
Vanity,... all Now, can you move the eyes further apart and strengthen I know. Did you try his home? No, Scully. I think he murdered those patients so It's not medicine, Scully. It's blood sacrifice. The most potent offering in black magic. What if Everybody wants to be beautiful, Scully. Dr. Franklyn? Scully, come over here.
Where's Dr. Shannon? They said she was brought in Don't let them operate on her.
To find Dr. Franklyn.
What happened? Then it failed. What is this patient's birth date? On Samhain... the Fourth Witches' Sabbath. All that came out of his stomach? Is it possible that he took the term mud pie literally? Is that what you've concluded? Well, according to the same report the coroner That was some rainstorm. Now that sounds like an exaggeration, don't you How a 6'4 250-pound man was buried alive.
I'm I want to hear your story. Well, the police aren't entirely convinced Right. But you see, you're not making Did he ever hurt you? Did you ever shove him back? That's why some people thought you might have You remember what was going through your head So he pounds the kid. And the kid pounds back. Kid says his stepfather teed off on him regularly. No, that's his explanation. He says I think he's a hard kid to love. I'm still finding it hard to reconcile the Well, then how did the victim swallow 12 pounds Did you ask if anybody else might be involved? That could be me. What is it? Who was it? Karin Matthews? Physical violence? Was his stepfather ever involved? So you're saying Bobby would have good reason You're free not to answer, Miss Matthews – You make it sound like a justification. Did you get a look at the body? Pushed out? About what? Was Lisa another of you clients? Yeah. What were you treating her for? Have you asked her what happened? We gather that she had a fight with her father Had you counseled her father? In what ways? Seems to be working. Does she think Bobby did it? I think we're all quite capable. Come here. Well, seems to me like some facts have been assumed. That I don't know. That's my point exactly. Yeah, but there was a substantial amount of Have you determined if the neck injury was Have you seen this? What do you make Scully?
Evidence.
No. I think he's scared enough That splinter you're holding came from Mr. It's greenwood, fresh from a living tree. Excuse me. It's been a few years. Kind of begs the question, doesn't it?
Scully.
Scully... What causes this? Ms. Matthews, we'd like to ask you a few questions. Your father's death. We need to clarify Yeah, under rather curious circumstances. Well, we thought it was strange that you didn't We spoke to someone who thinks it does. Someone I'm not expecting it to be. I don't think this was an act of grave robbing, More like an act of nature. The orchard man said that the blight that Between the people of this valley and their And Karin's father, 20 years ago.
all Who couldn't defend themselves. Something did it for them – or someone controlling Then we should talk to Bobby. Maybe we haven't asked him the right Yes, you do. Maybe you hated your stepfather, No. You can't go until you tell me the Why don't you give it up? Why don't you tell me – because you were afraid, not You weren't afraid of Phil –Phil never hit You wanted to save him. You didn't want What were you afraid of, Bobby? Couldn't do what? She who? Karin made you what? She made you believe you were a victim but Karin? Scully. Take a look at this. Talk about putting down roots. I think we're looking at Karin Matthews' father. The same way Bobby's father got pulled down This has to do with Karin, with her own father's I think she's the killer and the victim. Lisa... Where's Karin. You stay with her, Scully. Karin! Stop! Stand up to him! Coats Grove authorities conducted a detailed examination.
Abuse exists, as does the blindness.
I want this case.
Ooh, I can see that.
I'm aware of the facts.
That's what I'm talking about... ruling out other possibilities.
Two, three, four hours... this case is going to be a circus.
Every starstruck.
They think she's dead.
Don't bet on it.
Special Agent Fox Mulder, FBI.
I'd like to speak to Mr. and Mrs. LaPierre.
Mr. Bring, your... your card says real estate law and conveyances..
Have.
Well, it might as well be once the facts about Amber Lynn's disappearance.
Yeah.
If you really want to help your clients, Mr. Bring get them a real.
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre, my name is Fox Mulder.
I'm a Special Agent with.
When?
Um, do you know what time that was?
What were you watching?
What about you, Mrs. LaPierre?
Were you asleep?
Is that Amber Lynn's bedroom that I saw down the hallway there?
Do you always lock your doors at night even if you're home?
You know most of your neighbors, I bet up and down the street. You're on.
Can you think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Amber Lynn?
Mr. and Mrs. LaPierre, I want you to understand something because it's.
Thank you.
Oh, I hope so.
Yeah...
I really do.
It's open.
Come on in.
Thinking.
Amber Lynn LaPierre.
Yeah.
I do.
I'm sure he is.
I don't have a report.
They're not guilty, Scully.
They lied about where they found the note.
That's what I've been thinking about.
She's not dead, Scully.
Mulder.
Mom?
Hi.
Yes.
I am.
Are you okay, Mom?
Well, I'm not sure.
I... You know, I...
I don't know.
Okay, I will.
Um, you take care, Mom, okay?
Is it her handwriting?
But not an indictment.
Bud LaPierre says he'd been watching television and had gotten up to go to.
I don't think so.
Because that doesn't explain what happened to this little girl.
There's something in that abduction note that I've seen before.
My sister was taken by aliens.
Did I say.
What did I do? I provided a logical counterpoint.
And they are.
Pocatello, Idaho, 1987.
Look familiar?
Hi, Miss Tencate, my name is Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.
Will.
Um, we just have a few questions.
We've reviewed the facts of.
Your story is that, uh on the night your son disappeared you had a vision of.
Now, three years ago after seven years of incarceration, you changed your.
I have a, uh, copy of the note that you wrote.
Do you mind if I show it to.
Now there's a phrase down here at the bottom.
No one shoots at Santa.
A little girl disappeared from her bed three days ago.
This is a note that.
Neither note makes a specific demand.
In both cases, there's no evidence of.
Yes, you did, but, uh, it wasn't where you said it was going to be.
I think you can.
You can't explain it because you didn't do anything.
You didn't kill your.
They need your help.
Do you think that woman could have killed her son?
So how do you explain those two notes written ten years apart could.
No, I'm going to solve this case.
I am going to solve it.
I'm going to find those kids.
This is Fox Mulder.
Leave a message.
I'll try to get.
There's something I want your clients to see.
Don't shoot at Santa Claus, Mr.
...Federal investigation of the case will continue but will no.
I have a corroborating witness.
There's a material connection between these two women.
It doesn't make sense.
It's incomprehensible in any kind of a real world.
What is it, Scully?
Over here.
Diazepam.
She used them to sleep.
She called when I was in California.
She wanted to talk, but.
Uh... Why would she do this?
It just doesn't make any sense.
No, she wouldn't kill herself.
Why are these.
She saw me on the news.
She wanted to talk about the missing girl, Amber.
Whoever took my sister.
Look at this place.
I.
Scully, who else can I ask?
I know, but if you don't do it, I might never know the truth.
You've seen things.
I need to understand them.
My mother is dead.
You know why.
Look, I can help you.
I can talk to the parole board for you.
But right now.
I'm not here by accident.
My sister was taken away from me... when she.
I don't know.
Why do you ask that?
Tell me what?
Who?
You can see them?
Is my sister dead?
Where do they take them?
Your boy?
This little girl, Amber Lynn.
I'm glad you're here.
My mother was trying to tell me something.
I think I.
She knew what I'd find with this case out in California.
A child disappearing without a trace... without evidence... in defiance of all.
Scully, these parents who've lost...
....
who've lost.
She was trying to tell me something.
She was...
What is it?
It's okay.
She's here to help.
What happened here.
What was she saying?
74? The number 74?
Does that mean anything to you?
74 mean anything to you, Mr. LaPierre?
Let's go home.
We're not going to find these people's daughter alive.
What we're hearing... it's the delusional talk of people that don't want to.
Maybe, maybe not but you can't see a ghost and still hope to find her alive.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what is the truth.
What?
Some of these tapes go back to the '60s.
I think I know what we're going to find here.
It's what my mother was.
Scully. You're not FBI, are you? Time of death? Where did you find them?
Look, at least tell Thank you. Who are these guys?
Ah, uh. Never. I'd say you people already suffer from full denial. I would never lie. I willfully participated in a campaign of NSA, CIA, some convert organization Congress will uncover in Psychokinetic manipulation. The Russians were doing studies on it. The Chinese still Mohamed Amalaki. Convictions.
Illegal possession of firearms. That's 60 air minutes. A daily visual record is made of everyone who makes a transaction. There. Back up. Look at that. Maybe, maybe not. That leaves only one person we know we can talk to. Miss Lauren Kyte, please. Mulder Thank you. We won't be long. Can you tell us what happened that night? They were found dead. Does that mean you know? When you can tell me, this is the number where I can be reached And somehow crushing their necks? Packing, running away, from what? Hang on! Hi. The paramedics check you out? Mine's more IRS sized. Yeah, it's brand new. Only a 100 miles. Mechanic said everything is in proper order. Nothing cut, nothing They're not. The filaments are heated due to massive levels What if it's possible somehow to raise a body's electrostatic Well there's evidence of this all through the X Files. Either that or a poltergeist. They may be. A little upset over losing a parking space, wouldn't you say? She was his secretary. That's three people dead in the You don't see too many bosses graves without people dancing Excuse me, Sir? Is there an office here so that I can Do you know how Sarah Lynn is related to Howard Graves? Thank you, Sir. If she'd lived, she'd be Lauren's age. Not necessarily. Do you know how difficult it is to fake your own death? You may be right. Sure, all you got to do is prove that Howard Graves is still I don't suppose you ran any dental conformation? Who made positive ID on the body? But Howard Graves was cremated. There would be no way Mulder.
Why? Do you know who this is? We were following leads pertaining to an X File. Then we have nothing more to talk about. How's Lauren Kyte involved? My advice to you. Don't get rough with her. Ok, then you're free to go. Why? Because of Howard Graves? I know. He's watching over you, isn't he? So now Howard is protecting you? What are you doing Scully? You don't believe. Well we may have just sacrificed our best opportunity to observe You ready?
We don't have him. He's not even breaking a sweat. Lauren, it's over. We have to go. Lauren, No! Get down. I guess what we're looking for is here. Where are you going? Boy, she's in a rush to get out of here. Hey, Scully. Do you believe in the afterlife? Have you ever seen the liberty bell? You know, I've been to Philadelphia a 100 times and I've never Yeah.
but I'd really I don't know. How late do you think they stay open? Then who or what do you think was responsible? Then are you saying that a person or persons was Can we see the corral? Yeah? What kinds of things? Nope. Not a thing. Besides which, police and coroner's report make no The body's been transferred to the reservation authorities. Excuse me, uh, we're not from around here. We're looking for Anyone, uh, know Charlie Tskany? How'd you know? Well, they told me that even though my deodorant's I want to believe. I think you already know what we're looking for.
We're looking for anything that can Who were they? The woman in the pool hall said that people were afraid of Was the woman in the pool hall his sister? Yeah. We're gonna need to take a look at Joe Goodensnake's See, these are the canine cuspids. They're normal. No, you see the second incisor here is chipped just like Lyle Parker was attacked, he has scars just like Joe. Well, if Joe's teeth are abnormal, an autopsy might reveal It's a cremation. After that, we'll have nothing. Charlie? Do you believe that the spirit of Joe A true piece of history, Scully. The murders stopped that year. Because the cases were In '59, '64, '78 and now again in '94. But... How can you just dismiss the evidence - the tracks in the Let's hope so. I read the report of your investigation into the Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting? That's not from any animal I've ever seen. Sheriff, I think.
What are you hiding? Over? Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy on Joe In 1946? The Watkins case?
Just as long as it's not Spooky Fox. The healed scars on Joe Goodensnake's body. Shortly after, the police killed him. Eight years later. But with Watkins dead, how could Gwen! Let her up. Yeah, this is Agent Mulder from the FBI. I was told I So I can reach her there? What's that? Damn! It keeps disconnecting. The mountain must be.
Scully? Augh! I heard it come up here. Come on. It wasn't a mountain lion, Scully. Where's Gwen? She said she'd come see us before we left. Just pulled up and left? Why would she do that?
Thank you. I hope not.
Not as far as you know?..
Not this time of year?
Lots and lots of snakes.
Very pissed off ones, from the look of it.
That's the former Mr. Jared Chirp of McMinn County, Tennessee.
116 separate bite marks.
Judging from the wound measurements.
Yeah, with a pistol in his hand.
He fired six shots, into the.
No one seems to know that.
There was not a scale found.
Well, it certainly would appear that way but the question is.
Maybe these ones actually do.
Mmm... No.
But at the very least this case.
Reverend Samuel Mackey?
My name is Fox Mulder.
We apologize for our timing.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Specifically, you had suspicions about the manner in which he died?
As a sign of faith, worshipers handle deadly snakes or drink poison.
Why did he walk away?
That's funny.
I knew a couple of Catholic schoolgirls who were.
Enoch O'Connor?
Federal Agents.
Where's the.
I don't know, Scully.
When you... when you get right down to.
I'm just saying that-that your faith and O'Connor's seem to be.
Uh-oh, Scully.
What do you think O'Connor keeps in here?
It's all right. It's empty.
Reverend, do something about these snakes, please.
Just in case we're not, we could use a little.
He died from multiple snake bites.
We thought maybe you'd.
He does seem like a likely suspect only the local sheriff's office.
Jared Chirp died with a packed suitcase by his side.
Reverend, how close was Iris to Jared Chirp?
What'd you talk about?
Maybe that was the point.
We would appreciate anything you could tell us about him.
Keeping an open mind, Gracie, is it conceivable that O'Connor.
O'Connor is your father.
O'Connor barred her from his church.
She and Jared Chirp.
You coming?
Pray for the souls... lost to us..
Let her go!
I'd say it's good news for you that she's not here right now...
Alice O'Connor... succumbed to multiple snakebites in June, 1994.
Smart enough to know you're a murderer.
No one quite passes muster with you, huh?
You feel the need.
Because she no longer believes as you do?
Deputy found him about an hour ago.
There's no telling when.
Unless he somehow managed to do this to himself...
What about antivenom treatment?
Why not?
And you're thinking that her actions may not be entirely motivated.
Do you think this is what she meant?
I can see her being angry enough at her father to attack him.
He left in a hurry.
Packed one suitcase and a gun.
Earlier that.
It's not.
I don't know, Scully.
Sometimes a little intolerance can be a.
I'm just saying that somebody offering you all the answers...
Oh, it's lab results.
Am I reading this right?
That Jared Chirp.
It's dated the day he died.
Maybe he took her.
We know that.
What about it?
Scully.
Take a look at this.
Stay with her.
To find her father.
He's going to want to tie up some loose ends.
Drop the knife!
You all right?
Relax.
Help's on the way.
It wasn't O'Connor.
It was you.
You killed Jared Chirp.
No, I'm just beginning to see it now.
Jared must have come to.
Is that what happened with Iris Finster?
Was she beginning to.
Stay where you are.
Help!
Mackey?
They won't find him.
People think the devil has horns and a tail.
Not like O'Connor.
If this was some kind of test looks like I failed.
Proud and fancy-free.
The article makes no mention of the fire.
Grissom's company had a number of government contracts.
I think that the circumstances surrounding Grissom's death.
My source, the only one I have ever trusted, is dead.
Yeah.
There's a mistake here.
There's been another agent.
Skinner didn't say anything about taking on a new partner.
And you already talked to the police?
I heard the tape.
But no trace of a fire.
That all you know?
Listen, I appreciate the show and tell, and I don't want.
All right, I'll tell you what, I got a little work to.
It's your party.
National airport.
Catching the shuttle up to Laguardia.
I was hoping you could tell me.
That's fine.
I can have the ME wrap the body to.
You'll get it by five. How many other kinds of sleep disorder did he treat?
Maintaining that kind of batting average must have taken.
Did he ever show any signs of psychological stress?
But he was never delusional.
What's his story?
How do you do that?
So it's actually possible to alter somebody's dreams?
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
Exactly.
Oh stop it, or you'll hurt my feelings.
Yeah.
What is it?
I can make it in two hours. Spleen or pancreas?
This is Alex Krycek.
We're, uh, working the case.
Like fire?
Any theories?
What?
So, why did your friend from homicide call us.
So what does the ME have to say about it?
What's this scar right here?
Well, unless they got to his appendix through his neck.
Willig was a Marine?
So where do all Marines receive.
Where Grissom was stationed from 1968 to 1971.
Here we go.
Willig was assigned to Special Forces.
This leaves us with one person who can tell us what happened.
We just want to ask him a few questions about his military.
Is that why you put him in isolation?
How was he interfering?
Excuse me, but exactly how would Cole disrupt their.
Let's get Cole's face onto the wire.
Mulder.
Who are you?
Why are you trying to help me?
What is this?
Of course.
Someone was conducting sleep deprivation.
Why?
And Willig and Cole were the lab rats.
You think Cole's behind what's happening now?
I thought Cole was the last.
So how do I contact you?
I may still need more.
Is he alive?
Well, that second officer is still in a coma, so I don't.
Well, the military already sent troops to radioactive.
Well, I learned something at Dr. Grissom's clinic. About.
Well, what if that stimulus were to come from a remote.
Think about it, Scully.
In all those years without.
All right, I'll sharpen my pencils and I'll see you later.
I'll be right there, Krycek.
We're gonna check out another member of the squad and.
He's all right.
He could use a little more seasoning.
...then I assumed he would be.
Oh yeah, it's-it's great.
I'm surprised I put.
Okay.
Salvatore Matola?
We're with the FBI.
We just want to ask you some.
You know about Willig and Grissom.
Who?
Hey Sal, can you spare a few minutes?
And you never got tired?
Serotonin?
How long did this go on?
Well, then who did you take orders from?
We suspect that Augustus Cole may be behind the murders.
But why Grissom.
He was never in country, he wasn't.
Who's Gerardi?
We're going after Gerardi.
Cole sees himself as.
Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres of the war.
Mulder.
Do you have his number in Boston?
Try to have a photograph waiting for us at the security.
Stay here, I'll cover you on the side.
Federal Agent!
Drop your weapon.
Gerardi!
Where is he?
I saw him.
No, Gerardi was here, and so was Cole.
We just missed.
Okay, there's nothing here.
Start with a small window.
What's the problem.
I told you, I thought I saw Gerardi.
All right, what do you want to know.
It's just that my ideas usually aren't very popular. I think that Cole possesses the psychic ability to manipulate.
Yeah.
Where is this.
He's still alive.
Put pressure on the wound on the.
Step away from the edge.
Corporal Cole, I'm a federal.
That's not why I'm here.
I'm putting down my gun.
I know. One minute is all I'm asking.
What the military did to you was wrong, but your testimony.
Krycek put down the gun and get out of here. Krycek.
NO!!!!!!
You did the right thing.
Someone went through a lot of trouble stealing both our.
He said it's never been more dangerous.
No, the man who leaked us the report.
The one who's.
He said that closing down the X-Files was just the beginning.
I admit the photo's Children born with vestigial tails don't interest you? Five times within the last three months, all in a town with I called around. They're already investigating. That's good to hear. When you were admitted you said that the baby's father Were you abducted? But the baby's father is an alien? Take your best shot, Scully, but I think there's more going.
What answer? Yeah? Meaning the father had a tail as well? How would this happen? Birds do it, bees do it, even educated MD's do it. All five And four of the five women, the four married women not So much for not putting all your eggs in one basket. Uh, I'm Special Agent Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Yeah, we're just here to find out what's going on. Why was it necessary to inseminate in these cases? Hey. Excuse me. I'm an agent with the Federal Bureau of Scully, check it out. Eddie's pants Oh, we'll get right on that. Yeah. Like how'd you do it? So you're saying there was romance involved? Well, if you're waiting for my usual theory as to what's going A tranquilizer? I didn't think of that. Yeah, but when and where would he have had the opportunity Those women don't look like the type that do a lot of solo I have a theory. Do you want to hear it? Hey Scully, should we be picking out china patterns or what? What about what the sheriff saw? Conversely my theory goes a long way to explaining how Not unless they have trailer parks in space. This is Hey Scully, if you could be somebody else for a day, So boring! I mean, wouldn't you even be tempted to try out Well, maybe it's not, I mean everybody else around you It can't be a dead person. Because. We were uh...we're with the FBI.
We're looking for your son, Eddie junior. Is this...is this you? Does your son have any other unique medical conditions, Excuse me, sir, how did you know my name was Mulder?
It's him! Pretty spry for an old guy, huh? Well, whichever one he is, wouldn't you say he's a man I'll check upstairs. I'm all right! Ohhh. It's quicklime. Move back over there. Not so spry. You think the fall killed him? So what killed Eddie the monkey man? What's the other thing? What's unusual about that? Where did you find it? Um, could that somehow be related to his uh, having a tail? What would be the, uh, purpose of, of this, uh...muscle? Could this be a like father like son kind of a thing? Uh, could Eddie junior have, uh, the same anomalous Well, um, if this musculature underlies the entire skin, then Check that out.
Something about Van Blundht's MO confuses me. His victims.
I'm here to see Amanda Nelligan? What about Eddie?
Mulder. Excuse me, sir? Uh huh. I'm sorry Mr Nieman, I'm going to have to call you back.
There was a man. He looked exactly like me. Thank you. Hey. Van Blundht...
Think about it. Get your hands up. Keep them up there. Put your hands down now. Pull your pants up. You're the only ones here? I apologize. Only one of you is the man I'm looking for. Yeah, hey, it's me. I think you should get down to the.
Hello? Hellooo!! Get me out of here! Hello! Hello! I'm down here! Help! What's with the hat?
Does it? What did you want to talk to me about, Eddie? On what do you base that astute assessment? Yeah, but I'm no Eddie Van Blundht either. Am I? Who's your contact? Hello.
We'll talk later. How do you know he's missing?
Hmm, scotch. Windows? You never know. You guys turn up any forensics evidence Scully, look at this. Did you run a test on it? Does this look like an arm to anybody? This burn mark, it's right where I'd be if I were standing And I wouldn't be looking out the peephole unless there was Detective Ryan, can you have this bulb dusted for prints? And can you run those against Mr. Newirth's. OK, can you check those against all hotel employees and Yeah, do you have the name of the last missing person? Thanks, that should do it. Is this your first case, Any idea why they gave it to you? Well, don't be so sure about that. At first blush? Spontaneous human combustion. What are you talking about? I have over a dozen case files of human bodies reduced.
OK. Hey, Scully, can you spare a prophylactic? What are the odds of that, huh? Check this out. My newest tool in the fight against crime - What do we know about the victim? Yeah, but half of Richmond earns their paycheck making I don't know. Ah, look at this, Scully. Someone forgot to empty the trash. Patrick Newirth came into town by train, didn't he? Maybe that was a detail that was overlooked. Maybe these people aren't just disappearing, maybe Maybe it's not so spontaneous. Get on the phone to your Nothing else? The prints you pulled from that light bulb... Not yet. He was here, Scully, I was right about that. Maybe with enough to identify the killer. He was here last night. He was also probably here on That leaves us with 3 days of train station videotapes to Either way, the security camera's our only witness. Let's go back to the terminal tape. He's got to be on at least one of these tapes. See, this guy. Right here. He's always here. Why's he doing that? Can you freeze this and blow it up 200 percent? OK, can you reframe and blow it up some more? Polarity Magnetics. March 22. Do you know him? How's that? Which was what? Powered by what? Look at this! Like getting an X-ray. What do you think, Scully? I'm less convinced of that now. I don't know. Whatever it is, it's connected to the person I know of one place to start looking. On the videotape, Dr. Banton kept staring at the floor. You trying to tell me something? Did you tell her about Dr. Banton's accident? Like? What if, Dr. Banton... look here, there are hardly any The lighting in here is diffused. It's soft light. What if Dr. Banton! Stop right there! Dr. Banton! We're federal agents, Dr. Banton. I thought the orders were to keep this patient in the dark. We're trying to understand. Can you tell us how? You have no control over it? They? The brain suck? For the purpose of... But if they killed you, then wouldn't your shadow just... We caught the guy. Really? Have you talked to Dr. Banton? I don't think you know anything about this case, which is Transferred? Where? I don't think you fully appreciate this man's condition or.
Soft light. He needs soft light. Hope you know what you're doing, Scully. Putting Detective Ryan's ambition ahead of all good sense The difference is you never put yourself ahead of your work, And as a favor, we just handed over the A-bomb over to And I'm sure that Robert Oppenheimer got similar That man is scared, and it's not just of his own shadow. We've both seen the physical evidence, Scully. I think I do. Dr. Chester A. Banton. Do you know him? He's being held by the Richmond Police in connection He believes his life is in danger. Yes. At the Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital, but not for long. Why? Yes, I know, and you can trust them as you trust me.
Promise. What'd you find out, Scully? According to the floor nurse, there were three men. Somebody who would have access to plans for Virginia Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not I saw her leave. Well, maybe that was an appointment he was never meant You heard what Dr. Banton said last night. Put yourself in his head, Scully. I think the only reason Whether or not Dr. Banton is actually telling the truth, All that he's been trying to do since the accident is try to I was afraid of this.
Oh, damn it! The accelerator. Scully, look at this. He couldn't have. This chamber's been sealed from the You lied to me. About Chester Ray Banton. You knew who he was, I won't be your stalking horse, or the government's.
You killed Dr. Banton! A nurse at the hospital identified you! A young detective All right, promise me something right now. Promise me How you doing? I know it must be hard. I'm sorry I'm late, I got hung up at the Richmond PD. A missing person report was filed this morning by a Dr. The missing person was Dr. Christopher Davey. No. None. I've been wondering, what if it wasn't Banton we saw in Just that they worked for NASA.
They wanted to talk to I have no idea. 	It's beginning to look that way.	 Fox Mulder...	In what capacity?	Do you have evidence of sabotage? Evidence of tampering?	Does anybody share your suspicions? Well, if you were a terrorist, there probably isn't a more potent symbol of 	Not to mention certain fringe elements who accuse our government itself of 	Alien civilizations. Wow, look at that – Gemini 8. 	Well, the man we're gonna see?
Col Marcus Aurelius Belt nearly died on that You never wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, Scully? 	Col. Belt.
Fox Mulder.
I'm a big fan.
It's an honor to meet 	I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk.
Do you think there would be a problem with us watching.
It was an honor, sir. You didn't order the analysis? But as a matter of course wouldn't you order a material analysis if a part 	I can't believe how much faith we put in machines. I can't believe that Col Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts God, I hope so. 	I have to admit, that fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies. Come on, Scully.
You have to admit that was exciting.
Mission What happened? They have a press blackout in effect.
Chances are, the media doesn't know about 	I don't know.
Things go wrong all the time. Usually. Michelle!
I can see her. Kneeling at passenger side of overturned car).
You all right? You all right? C'mere.
Can you push with your legs? Okay, all right.
Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Okay.
What happened?	.
The Orbiter maneuvering system has Where's Col. Belt? Where's that? I'm a federal agent.
Come on out of there.
Michelle join Mulder. Did you see anybody else in here?
	.
They're cutting off ground control to the Orbiter. They cut off contact with the shuttle.
Col. Belt?
Col. Belt?
Can I talk to you for a moment? You've got no argument from me, sir.
You're true American heroes. 	Sir, I have to ask.
I'm sorry, it's my job.
Do you think someone is.
That's the liquid O2 leaking out into space.
The exact same thing We'll find Col. Belt. She doesn't know how serious the leak is. Col. Belt's been up there in the same situation before.
He'll know better than Col. Belt?
Col. Belt! Col. Belt.
Are you all right? They need you down at Mission Control, sir.
There's been another accident. You don't know that. He saved their lives earlier. And you think killing those astronauts isn't going to have the same effect? He doesn't want those men to die. I know it.
I'm sure of it. And he may be the only person who can get them down alive.
Now how can you be.
I need everything on the X-rays, diagrams, schematics - - any proof that Belt knew about a sabotage. This is from the Challenger.
It's the O ring fitting that failed dated January Something weird is going on here, Scully. Where is he? Get a doctor. How can we help you, Col.? Strap him down. No. He's trying to tell us something. Col. Belt.
Col. Belt, I want you to focus.
Focus your breathing. Focus.
Now you're focused. Right here.
Now you're going to save How do you know it can't survive? How has it been damaged? Did you sabotage the shuttle? Stop who? Stop who? Who?	They're bringing the shuttle down.
You said the shuttle would burn up on Change the trajectory to what?
You've to change the reentry trajectory. You've got to change it to 35 degrees. Col. Belt- - - It's your only shot. Something had possessed him.
Something he must have seen out there in space. I don't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him or that You saw what I saw, Scully.
I think he was trying to warn her.
I think that he Hey, Scully, we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the He gave his own life.
As an astronaut, that was something he was prepared to So why didn't they ask me? Why would I make them so uncomfortable? Reputation? I have a reputation? Spooky? Do you think I'm spooky? Grey. Grey. You said green men, a Reticulan skin tone is actually Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula? This is the print I took yesterday from Usher's office, these Most likely, he's not aware of them. These two prints were lifted And fingerprinting was just coming into it's own in 1903, but Now that's five murders every thirty years. That makes What did we learn in our first day at the academy, Scully? Each No, of course not, I find no evidence of alien involvement. And he should stick out in a crowd with ten inch fingers. Our X-file dates back to 1903, we had it first. You're down here too. Look, why don't we agree to this, You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would ya copper? He's not coming back here, his thrill is derived from the challenge Seeds? In there. You were right. I had her ask it. Scully's right, it is the guy. He lied on questions eleven and thirteen, his electrodermal Two murders with matching mo's occurred in Powhatan Mill in He's the guy. Maybe I thought you caught the right guy. And maybe I Of course I was, in our investigations, you may not always agree These are Eugene Tooms' prints. Only thing I know for certain is, they let him go. What's the matter Colton, you worried I'm gonna solve your case? It's Tooms. I found him. How do we learn about the present, we look to the Maybe, his neighbour played the victrola too loud. What about the prints? So what is this, the Anti-Waltons. I think what we have to do is track Eugene Tooms, there's four And you're gonna be head of the bureau by then. So I think Never was born, never married, never died. Feel what, Frank? Have you ever heard the name, Eugene Victor Tooms? 66 Exeter Street? The old man was right, you can feel it. Check this out. Somebody having a garage sale. Does he live in here? No, somebody made it. Is there any way I can get it off my fingers quickly without I don't think it's where he lives, I think it's where he hibernates. Just listen, what if some genetic mutation could allow a man And what if the five livers could provide him sustenance for Well we're gonna need a surveillance team. Well you go downtown and see what you can finagle, I'll keep It's about time. Eugene Tooms, he's unarmed but consider him dangerous. Scully Where is everyone? Scully? Dammit. Dammit, ANSWER. SCULLY! Look at him, he's building another nest. All these people putting bars on their windows, spending good.
I just, uh... I thought I'd poke my head in and say hey.
What, are you sleeping one off?
You going to be all right, sir?
He's going to tell you he's all right.
He's having trouble with his eyes.
He's also got a nasty bruise on.
That was the second opinion.
The first was unsolicited.
A phone.
To scare you.
See what you'd do.
Who you'd turn to.
Or about the X-Files.
What happened today?
Anything out of the ordinary?
This morning, you woke up...
Alone?
And how'd you get to the office?
Just slow down.
One step at a time.
How'd you get from the.
And then what?
Now think.
There's got to be something.
Did he touch you?
What time was it?
There you are.
He signed in here as a visitor to the office of.
St. Katherine's.
Dr. Orgel, you visited the FBI this morning.
You came to see Mr.
Go around back.
Drop the gun.
Drop it!
Yeah, so's your mom. Hey, give it a rest, huh?!
What?
You need to get to a.
This is a crime scene.
What would you rather I be doing?
I'd be a lot more concerned with the preservation of Dr. Orgel.
Actually, time is my only consideration, Senator.
A friend of mine is going to die because of S.R. 819.
I don't know.
I don't even really know yet, all i have are a few pieces.
a.
This man may die, he may only have a few hours to live.
Hey, do you have the key to this drawer?
AD Skinner's in the hospital.
Somebody poisoned him.
For doing his job.
I'm looking for anything that relates to a Senate Resolution.
S.R. 819.
You have a letter opener?
In your desk?
Something? What's his condition?
Well, can you fight it?
Maybe we do.
I found this with Skinner's morning mail.
He was doing a security.
No. This bill was going to vote in the Senate.
All it was waiting.
No. Orgel didn't poison anybody.
Orgel came to the FBI to tell.
You know what that means?
That's not me.
Thank you.
Hello.
It's a computer synth voice.
Somebody that must know he's here.
Federal agent!
Stop right there!
Hey!
What other forensic evidence were you able to lift?
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.
What.
From where?
Where is he?
Where's Orgel?
I don't believe you.
You lied to me this morning, you're lying to.
Where is Orgel?!
I need to know what he knows.
A friend of mine.
Tell me what you know, Senator.
This is about S.R. 819 isn't it?
It's the same technology that S.R. 819 will export.
Nanotechnology.
Microscopic, atom-sized machines?
Machines can be.
I don't believe that.
Not before I expose you and your role in this.
I will stop this!
The man who poisoned you was at the FBI that day.
Scully was able.
S.R. 819 was withdrawn by committee late last night.
Without.
If that was his true motive.
If he wanted to poison you to prevent.
Yes. Yes, I do.
And I have an idea who may be behind all this. His name was Lucas Menand, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. He claims that Menand was pushed, by a suspect identified Hmmm... sounds like a motive, doesn't it? Would you like to hear his alibi? Well, he goes on to tell a pretty convincing narrative and Well, not when campus security picked him up. Minutes before the accident, according to Jason Nichols. No. Can't. He's dead. Have you ever seen a body in such an advanced Where was he found? You mean he's actually getting colder. So what's your medical opinion, Scully? Well, you see what happens when you drink and drive? Maybe we should ask Jason Nichols if he can explain this. We'll just hope that he keeps until Thanksgiving. Yeah. Special Agent Mulder.
Thanks for seeing me. I know your attorney advised Yeah, people out there looking for him. I'm sure you know that the man who allegedly detained the Well, not unless, uh, you're capable of killing a man by The security officer who's now in the morgue has a body Do I think what's funny? Does this have something to do with you and Lucas He threatened your life? How'd he do that? Had you? Was Lucas Menand up for the same grant? And what research would this grant have funded? Oh! Excuse me.
No, I'm right in the middle of it. Security officer? I just spoke with the bellman who brought up the luggage. The iceman cometh. Dr. Yonechi was accompanied by a It sounds like that. Yeah, but what if he's being set up? Just about anybody who's up for that grant money could. What is it? A lethal injection? No, there's somebody I want to talk to first. Lisa Ianelli? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Yeah. You may remember me from this afternoon. Not anymore, apparently. In his heated hotel room. Why not? Well, if he's already dead, then he's got nothing to lose. Scully, look at his temperature. I think the real question is how somebody could have You say he followed you off the bus? And you were on your way to see Jason? That's what he can't tell anyone? Scully?
With a medical instrument? Well what if it's not a murder weapon? I'm just speculating.
Tell the unit to keep watch until we get Federal agents, sir, open the door. Hotel manager says he's been living here for five days. Hey, look at this. And what's the occasion? Or something that never happened. In a future that somebody is trying like hell to prevent Think about it, Scully. If Lucas Menand never gets hit by The old man couldn't save Lucas Menand, so he had to At least five years in the future, when they first Only because the old man brought it back with him. From when may be the real question. Unless you have a better explanation for how he knew Jason Nichols. Although common sense may rule out Well, there's one sure to prove that theoretical possibility. Show this photograph to Lisa Ianelli and ask her if it was Jason. I arranged for your bail. Well, that's why I'm here. Something's happened to her. I think it's something you should see for yourself. Yes. Look, Jason, I don't expect you to get your mind around The man we're looking for - the old man - he's you. If that photo is indicative of a pattern, you may be his Not according to the photo specialist that I had examine it. Jason, it's your story. So was your rapid freezing agent until two days ago. I'm not sure of that yet. Well, I think it has something to do with the practical Physicists like Stephen Hawking have hypothesized the Eventually, yes, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm hoping the old man can tell us. Listen to me, Jason. I need you to get to Scully and tell Has anybody been through here in the last hour? No, I'm looking for an older man, a man in his mid-seventies Do you work with him? You have access to his files. I'd like to pull up some information about his rapid freezing.
Mulder. Did Jason help? All right, he should have been there five minutes ago, Let me get back to you, Scully.
What do you mean, whacked? Jason! Jason!
She's alive, Lisa's alive! No, and I'm not holding out much hope that they will, either. They won't find him. I know what I saw, Scully, Never? Never is a very long time, Scully, you said that Yeah, but I take that to mean that you were suggesting The detective who contacted me told me to turn left. Stoplight. Well, I'm sure she meant stop sign. And your fact sheet said that there's strong suspicions of a If, eh, you detect a hint of skepticism or incredulity in agent Don't ask me... You don't suppose she's a virgin, do you?
Maybe we're just imagining that. If you detect a hint of impatience in agent Scully's voice, Don't ask me... Yeah, I see it, it looks like a, eh, goat, some kinda horned.
If it's no bother, if it's not too big a deal, maybe Oh, hi. He was scratching to get in and I thought, with the threat of Eh, first off, I'd like to apologize for my partner's rude behavior, I was hoping you could help me solve the mystery of the horny Do you see a, a goat here, some kinda beast? Well, what do you think is going on, if I may ask? What do you mean ‘seen it coming'? On what? An electrical surge caused a power failure, but somehow activated I went to follow up a lead with detective White. You see what? I didn't ditch you! That man, is he always that hysterical? Go ahead... No, no, be my guest. I know how much you like snapping on the.
What's that, what is that, right there, Who's doctor Godfrey? This may not be any time to mention it, but someone is wearing What?
Must be detective White... What?
What are you talking about? We came down here because of three unexplained deaths, detective What happened? Nothing. Yes, I, I have, which is funny, because I usually, I normally.
Actually, I'm sure I could eh, get you another Maybe we should just watch some television. There's a movie Was it a murder? Let me drive... Scully, it's not what you think... Will you let me drive!? No. I was just never sure your little feet could reach the pedals. When we were here before you s...... I'm a federal agent.... You said that you knew why people are behaving so strangely You said it was planetary? That's a bad thing? Why here?
Why is this affecting everyone? What if today was my birthday?
Mulder... Who is this? Where are you, Margi? Just tell me where you are... Come on, Margi, let's get you out of here. Who? She killed all the high school boys. How did she do it? Scully, it's me. I'm at a crime scene, a new one. I think I have a solid lead Who's that?
Hold on a Actually, I'm way ahead of you, Scully, because I'm standing Terri. You what? Look, Scully, I don't think this has anything to do with any Scully? Wait right here.
Detective.
Get her outta here. Something cosmic. Who? They're both in here. You don't wanna go in there. "We are but visitors on this rock, hurtling through time and You're the driver. Eh, Scully, if I'm not mistaken, we're gonna be taking a left Eh, there's an intersection up here, you're gonna wanna... Scully! You're gonna, wanna...! You just.... ran a stop sign back there, Scully. Sure, fine, whatever. You're the 1st medic on the scene? Can you tell me what happened? My name is Fox Mulder, I'm an FBI Agent. I understand you've How do you mean? Talked to him? The shooter described a man, a man who reached down and healed They let him leave the scene? He's vanished? All the cars in the parking lot have been accounted for? Mulder. Yeah. What is it? Quonochautaug? I'm on my way. She's cold.
Mom. How did she get here? Mom.
Hi. It's ok, everything's gonna be Palm? Thanks. Yeah. I'm. I just can't help thinking there's a correlation. A connection to the shooting at the fast food restaurant. My mother wrote the word palm, that's what the man who healed Why the word palm? But you can't explain it exactly, nor can it be explained how I'm gonna go back to D.C. I wanna find out who this miracle man is. This is everything shot by the 1st news crews at the scene. Yes it's supposed to be about 8.
Hey he's gone.Where did he go? Looks like he's gone but there's.somebody else in his place, Why don't you find out ?
If I told you, you'd never let me go. Call me if you find anything.
What? What are you talking about? Did you take this? I don't know. Did he hurt her? What did they argue about? You must have some idea or else you wouldn't have followed them On the day my parents divorced, my mother vowed never to set I have no idea what that could be. No. I want the smoking man smoked out, I want him exposed as the To our summer house, he was there with my mother.  He's the reason for what happened to her. It doesn't matter where I got those, the only thing that matters You know how to get it. Well then you tell me how to find him. He knows about the man who disappeared from the restaurant shooting. He's trying to kill him. What? Where is he now? Mr Smith? I'm with the FBI. I'd like you to come with me I'm sure you don't want to cause a scene at work, sir. We'll have plenty of time to talk sir. You see him? Will she regain consciousness? Thank you. You wanna smoke that, or do you wanna smoke on this? I should shoot you right here, but they probably would be able Or maybe shoot a bullet through your brain so you'd be bedridden What do you care? I don't care. And I know what you are looking for. Liar! Where is she? Where is she? I have what you want. Yes. I can't do that. And to you? Why? It's a weapon, isn't it? Used to pierce the back of a neck. Why do you want it ? Let me get clear on something here, what we're talking about No.
You shoot me and you'll never find it. I'm walking, away. Scully it's me. I've been up with my mother, listen to me. Who? Alright Scully, you gotta get out of your apartment, they're Off the I-95, uh Bond Mill Road. Scully!
Scully move away from him, come stand behind me. How do I know you're for real? First I want you to come somewhere with me.
I want you Hey. I heard you were down here slicing and dicing. There's a Michael Jackson joke in here somewhere, but I can't Requested by whom? The CDC in a kidnap case? Based on what other evidence?
That's interesting. What, So this man died of a disorder. He and four other young Scully, has it occurred to you that this might just be a...a To divert attention from the fact that young black men are dying.
Did you lift any forensic evidence from the body?
I'm going to join the snipe hunt Agent Pendrell. Thanks for turning this materials analysis She's not coming. She had a date. Breathe, Agent Pendrell. It's with a dead man. Well, it looks like some kind of thorn. Help me out. How could something this small travel 5,000 miles around the.
It contains a cerebropathic glycoside.
Is it lethal?
Did the toxicology scan detect any of it in.
Could his body have metabolized the substance?
Does that tell you anything about anything?
His pituitary gland?
So you found evidence that this is a disease?
Okay, well why don't you let me know as soon.
Off to water the seeds of doubt. Bye-bye. Ms. Covarrubias? Agent Mulder. Fox Mulder. Sorry I frightened you. I'm not sure why, but I thought you might be in a position to Four young men are missing in Philadelphia. One of the Is there any way you could find something out about it? Is that a yes or a no.
You can't, or you won't? What happened here? How does she know he's missing?
Or a reaction to a powerful cortical You find Alfred Kittel and you find another one of those weird.
Three months ago – one week before Yeah, undetermined, Scully, but not necessarily unknown. I'm sorry. We won't take up much of your time. The Well, we're looking for somebody that came a little more recently I'd like you to cross reference those names on that list with He's not home. We might as well get comfortable. Scully, I think if you looked up from the microscope for a minute, If this is a health crisis. Maybe we won't have to wait.
Mr. Boy, this guy can move. He has to be. Hey, Scully. Look at this. Nothing? Well, he's some kind of case the way he disappeared down that About Alfred Kittel and about several other young men who have We only arrested him because he ran when we tried to question That man ran because he's hiding something. To find someone who I know plotted to deceive, inveigle and Thank you for seeing me at such a late hour, sir. With all due respect, sir, I think you already know. `Something happened on a flight from your country about three You'd be surprised at what I believe, sir. This time? What kinds of stories? Come out to do what, sir? Then, it was a nightmare.
You'll have to find him first. I was looking for you down in quarantine. Samuel Aboah's.
I think this was.
This guy can squeeze into a coffee can, Scully. He could He'll find another victim. We interrupted him before he could finish. The killing is just incidental I think, Scully, to a far more.
If Aboah has no pituitary then his body Well, when you examined him you didn't observe one single albino That's what I'm talking about, Scully, survival. And not The lost tribe, a clan of sub-Saharan albinos linked by their Somehow, Aboah has managed to survive. Because of something somebody told me last night. It's just another way of describing the same truth, right? Free cable. I don't know, the same reasons anybody.
It's a demolition site. Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Owen Sanders' body. Ow. Scully?
Scully! Special Agent Dana Katherine Scully... I didn't know it was your birthday, Scully. That's the way I like to celebrate them... You're welcome. Oh, I got something for you. It's just something that reminded me of you. Two, actually. I made them into earrings. Read the back. It's, um... About what? Excuse me, sir. I'm Special Agent Mulder with the F.B.I. Uh, you can clearly hear the pilot say intercept on the recording. No, no, but there was a passenger on that plane who was, uh, Yeah, a man named Max Fenig, a multiple abduction victim, what's He'd predicted the accident, and from the sound of the tape, I'm hesitant to speculate. Yes, sir. Fenig, and there may be people who want to cover up this evidence. No, sir. I think we all share the same goal here, sir, and that's to Where's the plane? But not to Max Fenig. No, he was on this flight, Scully, I'm sure of that. I don't know... but maybe that one man's life was worth sacrificing Is that a hand? What does it read? So does this one. What are they listing as the time of the crash? That's nine minutes difference. Nine minutes, Scully. Do you remember the last time you were Yeah, something just occurred to me. I don't think we're going to find Max Fenig after all. Yeah, but I'm beginning to doubt whether he finished this flight This man's name was Larold Rebhun. You think Max was carrying plutonium? What would Max be doing with that? So... what caused this crash? You want to know what I think, Scully? And all the evidence will point to this conclusion but it will The crash of Flight five-forty-nine will go unsolved unless You're positive of this? There's still no explanation for this crash. And? In other words, there's still no explanation for what brought They're not able to, or they're not willing to? Because there are no facts, Scully. What they're telling you, That there is not one wristwatch on any of those bagged bodies. These men, no. These men are trained to identify moving parts. Louis Frish? I'm Agent Mulder. Were you in the tower that night? Did Flight five-forty-nine show up on your radar? Did you establish radio contact with them? Would there be a record of five-forty-nine on your log? What was their response? About nine minutes. Wasn't the initial report that there was no radar confirmation Sharon Graffia? Yeah. Does your policy cover the acts of extraterrestrials? Okay, Scully, hit me with your best shot. What do you think It looks an awful lot to me like this place fell from twenty-nine Was abducted, just like Max. Maybe it runs in the family. You're the experts. Why don't you bring your team down here Yeah, coming up with all that inconclusive evidence. Why not? Then what caused that? But it did. Hey, Scully, it's me. I, I just realized something. The, the No, I know, I know, I know, I know, I just need you to come There seems to be more than a little discrepancy. What you've And so do we. The military is working to cover up that evidence. Unless the aircraft that was fired on never appeared on his Shot down by the intercept aircraft, which, in turn, may have No, they didn't know to look for that. They didn't know about Hold on. Louis, help me out. Is he going to see us? We're not going to make it. Scully! Louis! I want to ask you something. What if that's because there is no second crash site, because Yeah. Possible? Yeah. As soon as I know. I stopped by your place. Nobody was home. Fox Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I. What's going on out there? Where? Can you show me? Over there. Not exactly. Once, I, uh... I got a quarter off of the deep end at the Y How long have I been lying here? They've done this to you? What did they do to me. Black Cancer? You helped them find the rock? How many men have died here? Is that what they say the tests are for...to find a cure? What happened to the man who was in the cell with me, Krycek? I'm not going to die... I have to live long enough to kill that man, Krycek. You'd rather suffer the torture?
Where are we going? No Russian. Tell your husband I'm sorry about his truck. Yeah. Why don't they kill you? Well, I have to go now. They'll come looking for me. They'll come looking for you. I don't know what you're talking about. What other ways? You don't understand...these tests. The smallpox scar on your What is the question? Mulder- I get to put my arms around you...both of them. It's been a long, strange trip. So have I. Boca Raton? May we come in? Scully. These people are test subjects. Everything that's happened...every death we've seen can be Well, he isn't working alone. Alex Krycek. The man who set you up...you and the members of your militia. You came into contact with him in North Dakota salvaging materials What was he looking to build? Did he ever mention Black Cancer. Wait a second. You said there were...uh.two devices. What. You want to know about anarchy? You don't tell me where that Where? Thank You. Scully, get.
This has been a big setup from the beginning. Where would you put this rock if you didn't want it to be found? Go back to the refinery. See if you can find anybody who knows Peers into the pipe.
Sees a box, but can't reach it. The bomb is about to detonate. He runs Why is this so hard to believe? When the accepted Then why are we here today?!?
Oh, Mulder. Fox Mulder.
Though I ask you not to make that known to.
Oh.
No, no, no. I'll thank him for you because I have to call in.
Oh, me, too.
All right.
Not many.
Certainly not in the way yours did.
Mrs. Weinsider.
You mentioned a fire in the room, in your account and a, uh... a.
But according to your statement... your baby... was not a normal.
Um... You were right there in bed with your wife the whole time Mr.
But according to... your wife's statement, at one point she... she.
Yeah.
Mind if I use your phone... Wayne?
Hey, Scully, it's me.
I, uh... Before I tell you.
I'm going to ask you to.
Call it what you like. Here in Roanoke they're calling.
Look.
I want you to look at this woman's charts.
Scully, Spender just round filed this case... it's.
Like that's any different from the assignment we're.
Scully, this is a classic case of demon fetal harvest-.
Exactly.
Yeah, but this is the real deal.
You check that.
Just humor me, Scully. Take a look at those medical.
Mulder.
What'd you find?
Describe them to me.
Protuberances?
You mean, like horns?
Do you think this is something that could be passed.
What are you talking about?
Mandrake?
You think Mrs. Weinsider self-prescribed?
Yeah? What? Yes?
All right, thank you.
Mandrake.
Hey, why don't you just let your sister talk?
It might clear.
She's not under arrest.
Wayne... Mr. Weinsider, I don't want to arrest Laura.
I'm sure.
So why don't you tell Deputy Stevens that it's okay to search the.
Whatever else we find I know everybody in this house is regular.
I know what you are.
Hey, Wayne.
Where you going?
You seem like you're in an awful big hurry.
Really? An appointment?
Appointment with who?
Right, you're in the insurance business.
That must take you out on.
So where is our appointment?
How far do we have to go?
Come on, Wayne, I'll race you.
Okay, speed racers.
That's enough driver's education for today.
Yeah.
What?
Tell him I'm down here doing a background check on.
I was down in the basement at county records doing a background.
That's where I was. I was piecing together the history of the man.
Perfect.
Not a shred of evidence is exactly the evidence I'd hoped you'd.
Wayne Weinsider. He's a Czech national, emigrated in 1994.
He's.
There's.
more. Read on.
I'm not suggesting anything.
I think the facts speak for.
I don't know why, I'm not a psychologist but this is the best explanation for how that I've heard.
You're going to find discrete osteopathic deformities to the upper.
Put out an APB for your brother-in-law.
He's not going to come.
Just find him.
He's done this to other women here, Scully just like in.
He's exercising his biological imperative and he'll do anything or.
Because they're demons and he wants a normal child.
15527 Leahy.
That's in Cave Spring.
It's West.
Scully, hold on.
Harmony Mutual Insurance has a second address for Wayne Weinsider.
Well, think about it, Scully.
He meets or screens prospective.
Wayne!
It's over.
Where's the baby, Wayne?
Put the shovel down.
Your lies won't work anymore.
Where's the baby?
You can't blame anyone else like you did with Laura.
Hey, cut it out!
Come on.
You're in enough.
I think the why is directly related to the how.
We should just go talk to this other wife of his.
This woman.
How many?
I know.
I don't think he did anything with it.
These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.
I think Wayne realized something last night.
That's why he was out.
It was no coincidence that she ran into us last night.
We were.
To have what only Wayne could give her. Well, what about the curse? The Secona believe great.
I'm sure. Can we see it?
Personally, if someone digs me up in Do you believe the bones are cursed? He had no political feelings about the piece being brought Do you know where we might find him? Yes, we would like to know. We'd be very interested Alone? It's nice to meet people who really believe in something, Do you think Bilac's a suspect? Based on what? He did look a little squirrely back there. Well, let me remind you we don't have a body and not I'm not sure he did anything. Go with it, Scully. They turn up a body? If Dr. Lewton was brought through here, it's going to be Maybe somebody didn't want that car started. Why not? Rats? What's he estimate on the time of death? That's about the same time as Craig Horning. I don't know. Why? I think it's starting to rain again. What the hell is that?
Do we know for sure it's Lewton? A man of taste. Torn or pulled? By what? More rats. Looking for Mona Wustner. I got a panicked call from her. Yeah, where is she?
Mulder.
No, but her car is parked outside.
Is there a date of entry on that?
Read about the jaguar coming down from.
Maybe that's how the intestines got up there.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
What's he want from her?
Scully, I'm going to have to call you back.
I hope not.
What are you doing here?
I said, what.
Hey, Scully! Come here for a There's water on every seat. It's more like every toilet.
I hate this. Rats. In every toilet. Yeah.
Finally a body. Someone fed this dog rat poison? And the dog ate the cat.
Don't you think that's significant? There were rats in Dr. Lewton's car engine. There were No, no. I think it's more than that. What is it that the Yeah. To summon the spirits. No, I think those rats were killed trying to escape from No, the lids were down. They weren't trying to get into Go with it, Scully. What about a rat? You ever see any rats in this room? How do you think they get in here? Hey, Scully, take a look at this.
How do you get.
Unless he was And only one way in.
Ladies first? Which way? Follow that rat.
Scully? Scully?! We still don't know by what. I think it's a cat. No, these cats. Which way is out? Come on, Scully! Can you reach up in there? Let's pull him down.
Okay, I will call you back later. What about the cats? Well, we both saw them down there, Scully. We know Well, by then it won't even matter. I just got off the phone with the Assistant Secretary of Five people had to die but they're finally taking it seriously.
No. Bilac's letter of protest. The State The urn will be back in Ecuador by the end of the week.
The icons from that world represent forces that.
Neat trick, huh?
Come on, Scully.
This isn't intriguing enough for you?
A magician turns his head.
But...
You think this was a murder?
Ah, observe the nearly complete absence of blood.
Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive one moment and expired the next.
Know also that.
A magic trick gone horribly wrong.
One that claims the lives of all who attempt it.
Can I see that camcorder again?
Thank you.
A tourist videotaped Maleeni's performance.
I don't know.
Neat trick, huh?
What, you think he's a murderer?
That'll be a neat trick in itself.
You never see his face.
Provided they haven't dumped the trash.
You attended a magic show.
The Amazing Maleeni.
A conviction for pick pocketing.
What did you have against Mr. Maleeni?
What about the trick where he turns his head completely around?
Those are great, but I don't see how they're any different or better than the ones Maleeni did.
Enough to make a magician lose his head?
Mozart and Salieri.
Which one's which?
If it was a murder.
I'm not convinced.
What do you think?
So he was murdered.
Natural causes.
So, basically he died of a heart attack, somebody crept up behind him, sawed his head off and.
And yet he performed yesterday.
What a trouper.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.
He look familiar to you, Scully?
The plot thickens.
Agents... Mulder and Scully.
FBI.
What happened to your neck, Mr. Pinchbeck?
Car accident.
So your injured neck has nothing to do with a magic trick you performed at the.
Oh, bad Mexican car accident.
In Mexico.
Why did you stop?
Pick a card, any card?
Hmm.
Very impressive.
I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck and I'm going to tell you how it goes.
I think that your brother.
Oy.
A guy's head falls off.
It's the greatest trick in the world.
Only there's no discernible point to.
This one's gained mostly police attention.
Maybe that's the point.
Mozart.
How about the chance to root through the professional secrets of your least favorite.
There's that, and he's got no legs.
How did this impersonator switch out the dead body?
Maybe not.
You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni had some gambling debts?
Check this out.
It looks like a marker.
$20,000.
Pinchbeck.
Interesting. Yours are the only fingerprints on it.
Very friendly.
$20,000 friendly.
Why did you play with him in the first place?
You knew he was a professional magician.
Don't you find it odd that the amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player?
I mean, this is a guy.
There's another possibility.
Behold... an ordinary household quarter.
Oh, no, no, no.
Blow your nose, Scully.
Blow your nose.
Ta-da.
The great Muldeeni.
It's misdirection.
That's the heart of magic.
I made you look one direction.
The quarter went.
I think we're being led around by our noses.
It certainly would appear so, but then again, you thought the quarter was in the right hand.
I'll bet.
Let's take a little spin, shall we?
It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck... or should I say the Amazing Maleeni?
It's a trick, Scully.
Voila.
That was your last performance.
I still think you've got a few tricks up your sleeve.
Did he have access to the vaults?
Any hint at all as to why Maleeni, here is really impersonating his brother.
What about this.
Maybe he got around the security.
Can we check the withdrawal records?
We'll hold you till we find out.
Make sure you don't pull a.
Maleeni?
Yeah. I guarantee you none of them match our thieves.
They're too clever to leave clues...
Yeah.
Who is he to you?
The magician?
Maleeni?
And the Amazing Maleeni.
That's a double bill I wouldn't want to miss.
Give us a minute, will you?
Good morning, gentlemen.
Did you sleep well?
Bravo.
Really.
Well, thank you.
It was, wasn't it?
It's only that Alvarez was so obviously guilty.
Yeah. Yeah, he's up a creek...
Just like you two want him.
I have no evidence but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni and, uh, I'll tell you how it goes.
I think.
You wanted revenge against the man who made your life in prison a living hell.
Alvarez. You and he were in the same cell block eight years ago.
Which gave LaBonge and in with Alvarez once everybody thought you were dead.
Yeah. That was you in the armored car disguised as Alvarez.
.
You have great alibis.
You have the best alibis in the world which is why I think you two got.
You could have escaped, stolen the money framed Alvarez and been back here in time for.
One that would be forever remembered in the annals of magic.
To you?
You go free... provided the magic is over.
They are the world's greatest.
Nah, there's more.
Behold!
The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.
No. I pilfered it from the evidence room to prevent them from completing their final act of.
I began to wonder, why did they need so elaborate a setup?
Why so high profile?
Why draw.
Yes. Framing Alvarez was just another misdirection.
This trick was about EFTs....
electronic.
What's that?
I don't know that.
Gee! Very nice.
How'd you do that?
No. Seriously, Scully, how'd you do it?
You know, it's not the same thing.
It's different with.
I'll show you - - - Using a process that restores moisture to the documents Yes. The ice had become superheated by the ship as it rose Well, I was hoping that you'd look more closely at the.
I didn't see Men in Black. As much as this all may sound like science-fiction we A shadow conspiracy within our own government. Which we will prove now that the X-Files have been reopened. I'm not sure I understand.
Agent Scully was assigned to the Next time, I'll wear a clown suit and do balloon tricks. The only reason I was in there was because you assured Look, Scully, that excuse is not going to work this time. I saw what that virus did. I saw it generate a new being... You need evidence to justify our reassignment.
How can it be denied? We're the only reason the Well, then, who is? Was there a vote?
Excuse me. Inside or out, I don't see that there's a damn thing you I don't have that proof just yet.
Yeah, if you're doing my filing. What are you doing in my office, Agent Spender? If you're about to tell me that you were sent down here No? Who is?
Diana, back on your feet.
Scully, come here and take a look at this. According to the investigator's notes in the file they're It says in the file he used his bare hands. Uh-huh. Aw. Somebody broke a nail. It ain't RuPaul.
The body of the other victim was There wasn't an attack. I think it was celebrating its That would account for the violence done to the man's torso. That's exactly what I'm saying. I don't see there's any argument here. You admit yourself What does it take? For this thing to come up and bite I'm talking about extraterrestrial life alive on this planet What happened here? Let us through. Diana, let us in here. A man was murdered. Then why are you here? There is a connection. I hope you know what you're doing, Diana. It's here, Scully, and they know it. Give me the keys and get in the car. They were butchers. How did you get in our car? Why are you here? The kid could find this thing. We could get his fever down. We don't have the X-Files.
Diana, what are you doing here? I'm listening. Who sent you? Why? To convince me of your noble intentions? You take Gibson. To find this thing. With who? Who removed it? Maybe that's why it's there. It wants heat. It needs heat. No. It's hot in here. Maybe somebody's got the flu. There's something in there.
Yeah.
Ditto.
The same virus you were exposed to?
What does that mean, Scully?
I'll call that bet and raise you.
Never mind. Just take care of Gibson. Open the door, you son of a bitch! Open the door! Open it! Open the door! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! It would help if you'd shut the door. It would make it harder They can't take away the X-Files, Scully. They tried.
Agent Fowley's report was a means Agent Fowley took me to that plant at great risk to herself You asking me to make a choice? I can't accept that. Not if it refutes what I know to be true. That's the connection. Wait a minute. I don't understand. You're saying that So if that were true, that would mean that Gibson is in My sister? Is she here? That's really going to cut into my social life. During my fever, I... I left here and traveled to a place. It wasn't a dream? I have been on the bridge that spans two worlds, the link between Mom? I need your help, Mom, but I don't have much time. I'm okay but I need your help. I need you to remember. I need to know more about Dad. I need you to try and remember, Mom. These pictures were taken Dad was working for the state department, he'd go on the road. Will you look at the pictures, Mom? Just look at them! Now, he must have talked about his work, about the men he worked I think it has to do with Samantha. This photo was taken at an amusement park three months ago. According to the police report, he wandered onto the tracks No. No, but the County Medical Examiner called me Well, I called the National Weather Service and they said on I don't know. That's why I came to Chuck, the king of It all checked out, Scully.
I think.
In order to get on those So the C.M.E. took it home and put it on his own two-year-old We're here apart from that investigation. We have reason to The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks. Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted Mrs. Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything Ah... does this happen often? You recognize this? It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot. It's an ancient And you didn't think that was strange? Yeah, my grandfather used to take that for his stomach.
Projectile vomiting at three months. And no one questioned this? Charlie had medical problems, too? Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, What kind of strangeness? Afraid of him or for him? Yeah, maybe. Yeah. It's everywhere. Look at this. No, I checked the motor. It's working fine. I don't know, but I'm gonna have this analyzed. Uh, the courts are reluctant to intervene in these matters. Really? You still think this is Munchausen by Proxy, Scully? I didn't do anything. Hey. You want to see something weird? Chem-lab analysis of the ash from the Holvey's house. It contains nothing organic or inorganic. In fact, according To get a second opinion. Before Chuck succumbed to the glamours of academia, That energy could have been what set off the garage door Well, who are you suggesting did that? The old lady... and Charlie. What happened? Did you talk to Charlie? Well, there was more ash on the floor under the old woman's It's mugwort. I think it's a ceremonial herb. No. The reverse swastika on the window and the red string I don't know, but I think the old woman knew the family was Who are they? Excuse me. Sir? Can I have a word with you? Sir, I'm with the FBI. You were trying to protect the family, weren't you? You said Mrs. Holvey? I know this is a difficult time, but there are Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing What secret, Mrs. Holvey? What are you talking about? How's Charlie? I'm amazed she hasn't broken down completely. What are you looking at? Where? Are you all right? You gotta get to Mrs. Holvey's house. That boy you saw leaving with Mrs. Holvey - that wasn't A spirit, a ghost - I'm not sure but it's what we saw in the Whatever it is, it's killed three people, and you've got to Get help. Scully, you all right?
The strange case of Charlie Holvey and the.
... The boy, who will celebrate his tenth Wow, you know you're going places in the Bureau For anything special? My long term plans? You got them right Whatever I hope to find is in here. You give it to him?
Please continue. I'm... sorry, can you rewind the tape? Please. I'll tell I don't have any questions. No. I don't think the Russian was the target. And a good chess player. Here, let me Okay, stop it there. Look what the kid You described a steep trajectory for the kill shot. More or less, yeah. Hi. My name is Fox. This is Dana What's wrong with Baywatch? How do you know I want to? It's not so cheap. Don't you want to Maybe because you can't. I'm right, aren't I? You know what I'm Oh? This kid's going to need round-the-clock protection. The kid's no chess master. Under controlled With the most unfair advantage. What We've seen a number of these cases before, Maybe that's why they want him dead. I'm not the mind reader. Well, let's test him. I think the kid I want to talk to the shooter.
Okay. When I first met you I figured you were just You're insulting me when you should be taking What does it take to kill a kid? Money? No... Thanks to the kid. I won't tolerate that. Spender, you Yeah... I read your bio. You've been.
Yeah, I know – you got I don't know. I might be able to get Think about it. Just his attention. How's little Karnac doing? There's something else. There's something.
Oh, you would have caught That's all I do. That's all I've been doing for Ah, we'd all be blown up by some terrorist bomb, Oh, you mean Scully? She's a, uh... she's a scientist. She just I've done okay without you.
Mulder.
Where are you?
Well, I'm at the psych facility.
Okay, what is it?
I'm on my way. Agent Spender! Agent Spender? You don't know who you were talking to? You're I was told he was dead.
Tell him exactly as you told me. There are corollaries – The individuals who have This kid may be the key not just to all human potential, No, it's bigger than that. I can't. But the shooter can. The assassin If what Agent Scully's found is true and I How soon can you call the Attorney General? The Attorney General's heard my request for She needs something more. Something To what? He's genetic proof, isn't he? The kid's not superhuman. He's just more human than Most of us have genes we don't use. There's a long-held but unpopular theory tied Where's Spender? Who do you work for?! You work for him....
Any news on Diana? What did Skinner have to say?
For who? This was all strategized – every move. Mulder. I don't know. Yeah, that's all he said. As far as I can tell, he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation. There's got to be something here. Some detail. Something we're Why would he do that? I don't think he'd call if there wasn't something here... something Hunting a man on a moving violation? The man in the photograph doesn't appear to be wearing a badge You say the suspect was shot. It's been almost eighteen hours, Captain. Where could the body The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive. If you don't mind, can we take a look at the car, please? I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find. Look at the car in this photo. Look at the windshield. So, probably, only a doctor would have that on his car. I had the picture enhanced and the plate is different. 3-A-Y-F. That's all you can make out. The rest is obscured. Maybe the, uh, real owner of the car has got something to hide. Doctor Berube? We're with the F.B.I., can we have a minute of your time? I'm sorry. Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved A silver Ciera, doctor. Do you own a silver Ciera? A crime. Were you aware that it was even missing? What kind of experiment? No. Thank you. Well, IT'S ALMOST 5.
We should check with the doctor's housekeeper No? What do you mean, no? Well, that's all we've got. He's in a delicate position. He has access to information and You think he does it because he gets off on it? My mother usually likes me home before the streetlights come Why? My level of commitment? Well, maybe if you'd given me something more to work with. A news report? Not very far. You know, from day one, this has always been on your terms. Let me tell you something. I've got plenty to do without chasing What? Closer to what? Suicide? How? I don't suppose there were any witnesses? The man we met yesterday kept this place like he was waiting It's a bit too calculated, huh? Yeah. The mapping of all human genes. Maybe the most ambitious Yeah, but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungee-jumping Well, maybe that's just it. Maybe we're not seeing it because Well, can you find out for me? I'll see what else I can find out about Doctor Terrance Allen Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again. Look, I got a number this Yeah. Who's this? Where are you now? I'm going to pick you up. Where are you? Hello? Are you there? Hello? What's the street? What's the street? Sir? Hi, Danny. I'm just writing it down now, go ahead. Yeah... Sixteen... Sixteen... Pandora Street. All right, thanks. Mulder. He's alive, Scully. The fugitive, the driver of the silver Ciera. He called the I don't know. Where are you? Is it smaller than a silver Ciera? What is it? Any idea what he could have been doing with them? Well, maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys. Can Yeah, Scully. Keep up the good work. Hello. I had a situation. I left my phone in the car. Scully... How soon can you be here? There's something I got to show you. It's alright, don't worry about it. Why? Nobody else does. Well, whatever it is you do believe, Scully... when you walk Destroyed by whom? I don't believe you. There were three men last night, I was chased. Doctor Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial Roswell? That's how he was able to elude capture. It was just easier to kill Doctor Secare. I'm going to find Doctor Secare. I don't know. I'm going to trust my instincts. Doctor Secare? I'm a popular guy. Why don't you answer it for me? Hey, Scully. It's me. They called me in tonight... Skinner. It's over, Scully. Yes, they can. I'm... not going to give up. I can't give up. Not as long as At times, I almost dream. Somebody tipped Ephesian off. F.B.I. But that message was to the church of Symrna. It's my understanding Are you? Let's start with her. Where are you from? Does it bother you that he has other wives? We were told that Vernon's been hurting the children. Sidney? Sidney, can you tell me who the president of the United States It's not just that. Somehow I just knew. Come up with something? We found Sidney. Voice spectrogram But there is a personality in her that wants to. We need a psychological What we witnessed meets the criteria established in the D.S.M.-IV. Judicial precedents have established that dissociative personalities What we are responsible for is the potential loss of fifty lives. Because he wouldn't believe me. You're safe with us, Melissa. The murderer's not here. Sidney, you can all go home. You can all be safe if you tell I'm arranging for a therapist trained in hypnosis to be at the She wants to talk, Scully. It's a matter of getting it out of You, you were there, Scully! You saw it. You heard it. Why can't You know how to find the other bunkers. Melissa... There is one way. Wouldn't you, Scully? Wouldn't anybody? Ghetto streets... shattered glass... bodies of the dead... I'm In this life, she is my son. My soul is tired. I want to rest. Dana, if, um... early in the four years we've been working together... Why? Sarah... if it were true... no life would be pointless. Ephesian preaches and his followers' believe that the F.B.I. I would be saying that if I thought he believed in Revelations If he doesn't believe that he can defeat the devil's army, he Is there contact with the temple? At times, I almost dream.
You told your sister you were going to disappear, Mrs. Hangemuhl.
I'm talking to your wife.
Mrs. Hangemuhl.
You told your sister a story, a story you were afraid of?
I don't think you were going anywhere tonight, Mrs. Hangemuhl.
I think.
Hello.
Are you in Chicago?
Oh, around.
Hey, nice outfit.
Before you check out down there check out up there.
Which is why last night there were two agents parked across.
I'm guessing that's what he said.
After, he got up, climbed out.
No idea.
He got away.
The agents gave chase, but no clear.
No.
Technically, falling 300 feet and surviving isn't a crime.
What if this man had some kind of special capability?
Some.
What's your point?
What if he got really, really lucky?
Well, thousands.
Yeah?
We'd have to find him to ask.
Looks like maybe we've found part of him already.
Yeah, but only this one Henry Weems made an appointment.
Come on, Scully.
I'm feeling lucky.
Your building super... Henry Weems... he isn't around?
I know that.
Clockwise.
Yeah, it's all right.
My ass broke the fall.
Guess who I found.
Oh, uh... Oh, uh... You want to try this on for size, Cinderella?
More to the point, you survived a, uh... 300-foot fall essentially.
Oh...
Must have been a high-stakes game, I imagine.
Did you win a lot.
What is that?
Did you make it?
Mm-hmm.
Mind if I...?
Ah... That's craftsmanship.
What does it mean?
Yeah, what's-what's...
It's cause and effect.
Yeah, we can protect you.
Come on, Scully, you're going to dump this case just as it's.
Maybe his luck is the X-File.
Oh... Car keys.
Must have lost them when I fell.
So, you get many of these?
Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini a.k.a. Angie the Animal..
Skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed.
Cause... and effect.
Okay, so... watch.
Yeah, he seems to have tapped into it somehow.
He-he won.
Okay.
Boy give you any leads?
Mm-hmm?
Henry Weems has no police record, I assume?
Ever since December, 1989.
Yeah. That's how he lost his eye.
Snowy night, Christmas rush.
On flight seven.
Call it good or bad, but maybe that's where it all started.
What doesn't track for me is why he's resurfaced after all.
Maybe that's part of the package.
Can't have one without the.
Maybe it's like you said.
Why wouldn't the luckiest man in the.
He doesn't hide, he avoids..
Henry Weems... you're a hard man to track down.
Oh?
You and I are going to have a talk.
Stings a bit.
But I'll live.
Come over here, Henry.
I want to try something.
Nine of clubs.
You go.
I think you know.
Uh, you win.
Double or nothing.
Whoo-hoo!
Tough to beat.
You win again.
It proves that if we played this 10,000 times in a row he would.
No, no, I do, 'cause when you get lucky... really, really lucky....
So you've stayed close to home mostly, kept a low profile but.
You don't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt but then you.
For what?
No.
I'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger.
As it is, he's doing a better job on Cutrona's.
Come on, Scully.
Henry!
How's he doing?
Far from it.
Maybe what you said about streaks is right.
And he's who we're focused on but there's no sign of a.
Which makes it very hard for us to obtain a search warrant.
Hold up, Henry.
Henry, what if what I said before wasn't true?
No, I'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may.
How is he?
Scully, what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems'.
Looking for Maggie Lupone..
Yeah, let's call that a dry run.
What are the odds for Cutrona being a perfect match?
Maybe your luck is changing. Yeah. Where am I going? Treat yourself. How did I draw the assignment? Skinner requested me? Mulder, F.B.I. Yeah, wouldn't want to step in anything. They lied. Any I.D.? No, I'll take your word on that. Wrap it up and send it to the F.B.I., care of Assistant Director I need to speak to him. Will you tell him that I'm here and I need to speak with him? Yeah, there is. It's kind of hard to make an appointment when you're up to your What's my next punishment, scrubbing the bathroom floors with So I gathered. It seemed to me like a simple drugland body dump, not the type Sir, my work on the X-Files... Yeah. No. But I should warn you, I'm experiencing violent impulses. You know, sometimes, it just gets really hard to smile through No. No, I've been thinking a lot about that lately. I've been Pursue my work in the paranormal somehow. They don't want us working together, Scully... and right now, It's a zero. They transferred it to our forensics lab. Look, Scully, I know It's an exercise. Skinner is just rubbing my nose in this one. Yeah. I don't know, maybe you can tell me. Attacked? By what? What's his condition? What kind of wound? Any idea what attacked you? A python? Oh, excuse me. What is it? Well, I'm up in Jersey. I should be taking the shuttle down Oh, excuse me, sorry. Yeah. Who is this? Yeah? Okay, go ahead. This was living inside the body? Lovely. This isn't where you tell me some terrible story about sushi, So, what, the murder weapon was a top sirloin? Before or after he died? How do these parasites attach themselves? Anything like this? Something attacked a workman in a New Jersey sewer this morning. Could it be? How big can these things get? Well, that's good. I didn't want to have to tell Skinner that Well, at the very least, this will be interesting to the Newark I don't know who you talked to... Well, somebody called me and told me I had a friend at the F.B.I. What part of the sewer was I in? They look more like a catacomb than a sewer line. And all the sewage comes through this plant? Have you ever seen one of these? It's called a fluke. It came from the body they pulled out of What is it? Scully, it's me. You know that fluke you caught? It must have been the runt of the litter. There it is. Tucked away in the far corner, behind the pipes. I don't know if you can see it from here, but it has no sex I don't know, but it looks like I'm going to have to tell Skinner How did you make the connection at all? Well, that's just an unexpected response, considering the bizarre There's no way you'll prosecute this. This is not a man. It's a monster. You can't put it in an institution. Two? You know, you had a pair of agents that could have handled a What do you got? Watch all the storm drains, any access to the sewer system. Who am I speaking to? Yes. Why is it imperative? The tanker. What if he's on the tanker truck? So he could have already been here and gone? And every tanker dumps its load here? Everything is processed through this plant? Then what happens to it? Could this thing have escaped through that outlet pipe? Guess all we can do is wait. I'm at the treatment plant. I was playing a hunch it might have Forget it, it's stupid. Why not? You mean it's trying to reproduce? Yeah... I know, Scully. It could multiply. Where? That's near where we found the first body. That must be where it got into the system. Let's see if we can get that gate closed. Hey! You all right? Give me your hand! We need some help down here! No. But I should warn you, I may reek a bit out of the sewer. Success in our work is imperative, Scully. Reinstatement of No. We have a friend in the F.B.I. Human? How does that happen? I know these. These are from Chernobyl. You know, they say three species disappear off the planet every This woman claims to have been taken aboard a spaceship What's that? Where in New Jersey? Not an uncommon place to lose a body part. They You feeling lucky Scully? Ever hear of something called The Jersey Devil? Read the file about the case in 1947. 1947, family watches dad get dragged off into the woods, No, the original disappeared from the Patterson PD's files I heard the same story when I was a kid too, funny thing Who found the body? Any ideas about that? Well we're not here on an official capacity, Agent Scully's Any suspects yet Detective? There's no need to get bent outta shape. So what's eating that guy? Yeah, chances are he's without a clue. He'll probably Hey whatta you say, we grab a hotel, take in a floor show, Ok, we can skip the floor show. What you gotta date? A little poking around, maybe make a weekend out of it. Victim was a homeless man, you get many of them wandering Scared? Of what? People say that's just a myth. What do you think? Really. You never saw him again? You think it might be what's responsible for the body Yeah. How far is it into town from here? I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway for the next couple Did anybody here know Roger Crockett? Roger Crockett? Anybody? Did you know Roger Crockett?
Any ideas who might've done it? No, I'm FBI. Ok. What is this? Does it mean anything to you? Where? Here? Are you hustling me? Who do you think it is? Has anybody else seen it? Anybody told the cops? Where're you sleeping tonight? You know the er, The Galaxy Gateway? Yeah, they do. You got a man up on that roof. Hey back off. I'm telling you, there's a man up on that roof. Enjoying the nightlife here in beautiful Atlantic City. That's good, let's go see her together, and while we're Statements given to you describing something stalking Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight? Oh is that your job, or is it to keep the dice rolling, Who's going to be responsible when you lose your first tourist, I'm not far from where you left me. Er Scully, you got anything happening this morning? That's a guy getting sick. You gonna rag on me or you gonna take me to get something It moved like a cat, quick and graceful. There's What? They dropped the charges, that guy Thompson, he ran me I saw it, it's exactly the way the ranger described it, It was peeking through the garbage Scully, if it was a But you do believe that I saw something, don't ye? I still got a hotel room I'm paying for. Another birthday party? Can you cancel? I have a life! Why is that? What's this chart? Why? So we kill other species in order to survive. But what if something entered the food chain above us? But, but what if through some fluke of nature, a human Right, yeah, an.and, and haven't there been cases were, But even when faced with extinction? Yea, highly unlikely, but not outside the realm of extreme Mulder. Oh yeah, hi. Where's the body now? You're sure it was a male? Scully. Sorry to interrupt your evening. I just had an amazing thought, maybe it isn't a beast-man They're going to try and sweep this whole thing under Any publicity and you're got the streets crawling with The body they found was a male, there's a fifty-fifty This thing has no fear of heights. We'll stay together What if it is a female Scully? How close is she Eight million years out of Africa, I don't think we're While we overpopulate the world and create new technologies Scully. You should've seen her, she was beautiful. She could've torn my head off Scully but she didn't, she What? What? Well tell him he's got a real live neanderthal on the That is such crap, you can. Let's go. You could take her alive. Can you reach her from here? Why did you have to kill her? Good luck. There would have been offspring. She was just protecting her children Scully, it all makes Thanks for the offer but I've got an appointment at the Requisition for a car please Fran. Thank you.
Who was that on the phone? A guy. Same guy as the guy you had dinner with the You gonna have dinner with him again? No interest? Thanks Fran. Don't you have a life Scully? Eight million years out of Africa. Napoleon Neech Manley. He was convicted in 1984 for double Yeah, he'd been to the chair twice before but the governor Well, Manley was interesting. He was well-read, charismatic. Apparently, this was more than just a dying man's hope Manley didn't just claim that he was gonna come back but that Yesterday, a death row guard was found dead inside the cell Any idea how one of your guards could get murdered in an According to our reports, there were threats this might Do you give any credence to Neech Manley's claims that he So you're saying that Manley planned this and is carrying it Did Manley have many friends among the prisoners? I've been told you believe Neech Manley's claims. What are you saying, Speranza? You believe Manley killed A prisoner waits for an opportunity... Yeah, but you've got prisoners on work detail. Trustees - Why? Reincarnated. Into what form? Any idea how he did it? Yeah, fine. Okay. I'll be right there. What's wrong, Scully? I hear you have a list. Guard? How did you come by this list you claim to have? How many names are on the list? So you knew those two guards were gonna be murdered? Who do you think killed them? You want to make some kind of deal, huh? Why? Are you on the list? Well, what if they don't give you what you want? You don't have the authority? Yeah. Listen to this. I come in return to the beginning of the Neech Manley, 1994. This stuff goes on for hundreds of Unless he knew something we don't. Every major world religion encompasses the idea of life after Well, even Christianity teaches about the resurrection and Is there another competing theory? That this is a complex scheme, that the headless man planted.
Yeah, but imagine if it were true, Scully. I remembered your birthday this year, didn't I, Scully? Mrs. Manley? We're from the FBI.
We'd like to ask Did he ever share his thoughts about dying with you? You think he's come back, don't you? She was nervous, or scared. A lot could have happened in her life in those 11 years Neech I don't know, but I've been thinking a lot about that list, Who? No one heard anything? Warden? Warden? Why Roque? Well then, why the other victims? Did Neech have a history with the guards who died? How badly was he beaten? So there's a pattern here, a logic. All these men had a A lockdown may not solve your problem, warden. If it's a conspiracy among the inmates, but how many I'm saying that Roque may not be victim number three. How many men know it? Well, his life may be in danger. Well look at it this way, warden. If I'm right, it'll reduce I'm counting Neech Manley. Mr. Simon? Perry Simon? Couple of days' worth of mail. What is it? You told me everything but what I need to know. How's he doing it, John? And you're just gonna let those men die? Well, they're going to pin it on somebody! They're gonna pin Put you in solitary, one hour a week outside your cell, You're afraid of Neech? You saw Neech. Tell me who else is on the list, John. Who's next? Roque's not on it? And? What kind of connections? Why help Speranza now? You think Speranza's got some sway with Neech? Murdered? This is Agent Mulder. Please open the door. Mrs. Manley, we're federal agents. Open the door.
Danielle?
Mrs. Manley, open the door.
On a count... Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon, Danielle.
Let's get a Forget it. You know, it just doesn't make sense. Laying it all on Parmelly. It doesn't bother you that he was only on duty for one of the Well, why would he come to you and try to get you the list? But Neech hated Roque. If Parmelly was working with Neech, I just don't see the motives. Do you? I don't think Speranza and Neech's wife both said they saw him.
I'm on him! Scully. I lost him.
He got away. What happened?
I don't know what you're talking We're late for the hearing. We're not all dead? Haley's extremely suspicious to the point of paranoia.
Yeah? I saved your ass.
I didn't know about the.
No. The Justice Department.
What else can I say?
Hey, you came to me.
Yeah?
Ooh. Is this the Okay, deal me in. Well, you might want to put that hood back on me unless I told you on the phone. I was set up. I'm telling the truth. Wait, No. No. No. You want me to lie and say yes?
I'm going to kill you, you son of a bitch!
I risked everything! If I was.
Yeah. No, I didn't set you up. If you got set up, Get out of here! I don't know what you're talking about Nothing. Yeah, if you keep pulling it around like that. 14 people? That doesn't make any sense.
They're testing me, too. Haley's paranoid.
They still need something from me... and Terrorist lie detector. Well, I must have. I'm still here. They told I think I convinced Haley that the near miss in Folger They're waiting for my call.
If you don't hear from me by Tell the gimp to back off. I need that back by tomorrow. No. I have my beliefs. I'd prefer it didn't come to that. Right. I got it! No. He's still alive. What are you doing? What are you doing? The bank heist was a decoy. To contaminate the money.
They're testing me, too. Haley's paranoid...
They still need something from me. I don't need a car. You can just call me a cab, that'd Go where?
You hear that? Who are you? FBI. Who's in charge? Who's in charge? The money! They sprayed the money. How did you know it was this bank? With the...? August Bremer, or whatever his real name is – he's working You're saying I was set up? I was being used? This whole operation? The The hell they aren't. Those were tests on us to I want that money rechecked. That money's as dirty as you are, isn't it. Isn't I want people to know the truth. Was she here? Is she here?! She's alive? Scully? The answer just got loaded onto that chopper! Who? What time is it? It's time to thank your lucky stars. I'm not laughing at you. I'm just very happy to be standing here You were airlifted here in vasogenic shock. You've got some first-degree burns and scorching on your hands You don't remember? Is any of this coming back to you? I was hoping you were going to answer that question for me. I'll come back. I'm sorry. What was I doing with her? What makes you think we have Look - Your mother will be found. Well, at least you're not alone. None of the other survivors have Do you remember when you last saw Cassandra Spender? I ran more x-rays. I haven't told anybody yet what I found, though. That would explain how you were directed to the site, and why It all comes down to a question, Scully. One that hasn't been I don't trust those memories now. If I could give you those memories, if I could prove that I was I'm familiar with the regression process and Dr. Werber's work. The imagery is startling, but not atypical.
bright lights, Described and then interpreted into a linear narrative, a, uh, That Agent Scully witnessed a very powerful event. Not unlike It was staged. To test a classified military project, or to cover it up. Cassandra Spender was taken aboard a military aircraft, Then I suggest you put that in your report. Isn't that how you like to beat yourself? If those are my last Hey, thanks. What's stopping you? I thought you were serious. Serve who? Krycek, you're a murderer, a liar and a coward. Just because Come in. Thinking. Oh, the usual. Destiny, fate, how to throw a curveball. I've been doing some reconsidering of my own. Maybe an answer... to a question you and I seem to have We're federal agents requesting permission to enter the base. It's Mulder. I wasn't aware that any special authorization was Are you aware there's been a leak and contamination in one Why don't you go check on that, son? I'd hate for somebody Buckle up, Scully. Who? Nooooooooo! I don't know.
She knows. Yeah. We got to act fast. No doctors. Get me Scully. Look... I know you've been compromised. Him. Kritschgau. Ask him to prove What's causing this. What's causing this is alien. That's I do. That's why I need you.
Now. Now. Now. Now. But I see them in my head. You don't want to believe. You're not.
Mom, where you going?
I could always hear you.
You've come to kill What choice? I'm dying, you idiot. If I could get Wh... wh... what the hell are you doing to Why should I take your hand?
No... I can't. All the I'm not sure. Why? A man can't just disappear.
I feel better than I did.
I don't smoke. Where are we? I don't understand. Hello? Anybody home? It can't be. You're dead. Scully... saw you get shot... on the bridge I felt responsible for your death. I thought that you died for my quest. Hello. Hey, buddy, that's okay. You can build Who's there? Who are you? Morning.
No. I'm serious. I have commitments....
Childish? Wow...
Just like that? I'm just supposed to Yeah, including why you live in a bigger house Diana? Wow. What did you make? Hey! What are... what are you doing? We're the last, you and I.
You... help... me. Scully, what are you doing here? Oh, wait. Tie goes to the runner. Scully, I, um... I was coming down... to work Is it any more impossible than what you saw Scully, I was like you once... I didn't know You... were my friend, and you told me the No! You're dead. Where am I? I'm thinking about getting the hell out of here. About my son... about his mother. What do you want from me?! Yes. What should I be thinking? Yes. I'm a guilty man. I failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest Dana. You okay? Well, it's okay, I'm alright. They're treating me really well in Nothing. I'm squared away. Oh, hey, Walter. It's good to see you, man. Oh, yeah, yeah. We're clear on that. My crimes.
I murdered a man, Dana. I went looking for something I don't think you heard me. And why is that? I'm a guilty man. Uh... excuse me.
I don't understand. Why are you helping me? You saw him? Mulder? I smelled you coming, Clarice. No, that is funny. What's not funny is what they do to you in here if you don't put on Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man. Uh-huh, I kind of gathered that right around the 50th brainwashing.
They think that they're preparing me for my trial. For my testimony. Not building. Rigging. My trial's a forgone conclusion. What they really want is for me to Have they produced a body? You can't produce a body because you can't kill a man who won't die. Would you defend a man who believes in aliens against the FBI and the You know all the facts, the details the whole government conspiracy. They can't try me without exposing themselves. I know what I'm doing. Whooo, now it's a party. Is it time to go? We can't win, Scully. We can only hope to go down fighting. I know what I'm doing. I do know. Skinner told me. I know you had no choice. I just missed both of you so much. In New Mexico. Looking for The Truth. I can't tell you. Scully, I can't tell you.
You've got to trust me, Scully. I know things. It's better.
It's okay. Try your case. Yeah. The destruction of mankind. I know what you want and I can't give it to you. I'd rather die, Scully. Because this is greater than you or me. This is about everything we I can't. I just can't. Who's that? Who's there? What are you doing here? I'm putting the truth on trial. They're afraid to hear it. I'm not afraid of that. No. Because I refuse to accept it. How can you possibly help me? No. It's okay. Let her go. Doesn't matter. No, not him. He's reading your mind right now. He's one of them. One of them! I want that man examined! You're afraid! Where's Gibson? He shouldn't have done what he did... exposing himself like that. It's going to take a little more than that the way things are going. No. No. Listen to me, they'll destroy you. They'll put you out on the street. It's not about how good you are. They control the game. They own it. What? If she's got evidence, you got to listen.
Yes. I'd like to congratulate you on succeeding where so many before you You may believe yourselves rid of your headache now and maybe you are Who's there? What are you doing? None of you will be safe now. That's right. To see a man about The Truth. Oh, boy. I can't. Because I need to know the truth. I need to know if I can change it. I'll be right with you, Scully. Pueblos. Anasazi Indian. Abandoned 2,000 years ago. Nobody knows Hello. My name is Fox Mulder. Do you understand me? I was sent a message and a key to the government facility at Mount You're no wise man. You're a dead man. Just like Krycek and X. You didn't help me. You sent me to that government facility knowing You call me afraid? Look at you sitting here alone in the dark like a Come on, let's go. You don't have to hear this. Yeah, you smile... feeling drunk with power. The power to do nothing. Agent Doggett! Get out of here! No!
Go! Go! I'm thinking... I'm a guilty man. I've failed in every respect. I I believe that I sat in a motel room like this with you when we first... I've failed. Mmmm. I've been chasing after monsters with a butterfly net. You heard the Well, I was afraid of what knowing would do to you. I was afraid that it would crush your spirit. And look what it's gotten you. I want to believe that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to.
Maybe there's hope. No! You're dead. Where am I? I'm thinking about getting the hell out of here. About my son... about his mother. What do you want from me?! Yes. What should I be thinking? Yes. I'm a guilty man. I failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest Dana. You okay? Well, it's okay, I'm alright. They're treating me really well in Nothing. I'm squared away. Oh, hey, Walter. It's good to see you, man. Oh, yeah, yeah. We're clear on that. My crimes.
I murdered a man, Dana. I went looking for something I don't think you heard me. And why is that? I'm a guilty man. Uh... excuse me.
I don't understand. Why are you helping me? You saw him? Mulder? I smelled you coming, Clarice. No, that is funny. What's not funny is what they do to you in here if you don't put on Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man. Uh-huh, I kind of gathered that right around the 50th brainwashing.
They think that they're preparing me for my trial. For my testimony. Not building. Rigging. My trial's a forgone conclusion. What they really want is for me to Have they produced a body? You can't produce a body because you can't kill a man who won't die. Would you defend a man who believes in aliens against the FBI and the You know all the facts, the details the whole government conspiracy. They can't try me without exposing themselves. I know what I'm doing. Whooo, now it's a party. Is it time to go? We can't win, Scully. We can only hope to go down fighting. I know what I'm doing. I do know. Skinner told me. I know you had no choice. I just missed both of you so much. In New Mexico. Looking for The Truth. I can't tell you. Scully, I can't tell you.
You've got to trust me, Scully. I know things. It's better.
It's okay. Try your case. Yeah. The destruction of mankind. I know what you want and I can't give it to you. I'd rather die, Scully. Because this is greater than you or me. This is about everything we I can't. I just can't. Who's that? Who's there? What are you doing here? I'm putting the truth on trial. They're afraid to hear it. I'm not afraid of that. No. Because I refuse to accept it. How can you possibly help me? No. It's okay. Let her go. Doesn't matter. No, not him. He's reading your mind right now. He's one of them. One of them! I want that man examined! You're afraid! Where's Gibson? He shouldn't have done what he did... exposing himself like that. It's going to take a little more than that the way things are going. No. No. Listen to me, they'll destroy you. They'll put you out on the street. It's not about how good you are. They control the game. They own it. What? If she's got evidence, you got to listen.
Yes. I'd like to congratulate you on succeeding where so many before you You may believe yourselves rid of your headache now and maybe you are Who's there? What are you doing? None of you will be safe now. That's right. To see a man about The Truth. Oh, boy. I can't. Because I need to know the truth. I need to know if I can change it. I'll be right with you, Scully. Pueblos. Anasazi Indian. Abandoned 2,000 years ago. Nobody knows Hello. My name is Fox Mulder. Do you understand me? I was sent a message and a key to the government facility at Mount You're no wise man. You're a dead man. Just like Krycek and X. You didn't help me. You sent me to that government facility knowing You call me afraid? Look at you sitting here alone in the dark like a Come on, let's go. You don't have to hear this. Yeah, you smile... feeling drunk with power. The power to do nothing. Agent Doggett! Get out of here! No!
Go! Go! I'm thinking... I'm a guilty man. I've failed in every respect. I I believe that I sat in a motel room like this with you when we first... I've failed. Mmmm. I've been chasing after monsters with a butterfly net. You heard the Well, I was afraid of what knowing would do to you. I was afraid that it would crush your spirit. And look what it's gotten you. I want to believe that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to.
Maybe there's hope.
I have seen the life on this.
Did you bring enough ice cream to share with the rest of the.
Ugh. Bet the air in my mouth tastes.
Looking for anomalies, Scully.
Do you know how many so-called.
No, I won't sit idly by as you hurl cliches at me.
Preparation is.
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
I scream, you scream, we all scream for nonfat tofutti rice.
Reading the box scores, Scully. You'd like it. It's like the.
Of course not.
Is that...Arthur... Dales...
Ah... Choo!
I'm-I'm sorry, sir, I'm-I'm looking for Arthur Dales.
No, you're not.
No, I'm sorry, sir, I know Arthur Dales and you're not Arthur.
How do you know my name?
Mr. Dales, I have a, uh... I have a photo here of your brother.
Okay, and you're standing with Negro League legend Josh Exley who.
61 home runs in 1948.
'47, whatever. I don't really care about the baseball, so much.
Wait a minute. I like baseball.
Yeah.
A hundred and sixty-three.
Righty.
373 lefty.
536 total.
Yes, sir, that may be true.
I'm thinking that your experience in.
I guess... women change men all the time.
What exactly has your brother told you about me?
Mr. Dales, if you and your brother have really known about this.
I would have believed you.
Not ripe?
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I have been.
What is this?
You're making me feel like a child.
I've got to give it to you, Arthur.
Calling a Negro league team.
You seriously want me to believe that Josh Exley maybe one of the.
Babe Ruth was an alien?
Joe DiMaggio?
Willie Mays?
Mantle? Koufax? Gibson?
So I assume you're speaking.
Let me get this straight.
A free-spirited alien fell in love with.
You're also implying that this baseball-playing alien has.
Drift it is, sir.
Okay, so was Ex a man who was metaphorically an alien or an alien.
It's official.
I am a horse's ass.
Well, I have noticed over the course of time, a man and his dog.
You've never hit a baseball, have you, Scully?
Get over here, Scully.
This ain't cheap.
I'm paying that kid ten bucks an hour to shag.
Hey, it's not a bad piece of ash, huh?
The bat-talking about the bat.
Now, don't strangle it. You just.
Okay, now, we want to... we want to go hips before hands, okay?
One more time.
Hips... before hands, all right?
What is it?
Right. We're going to wait on the.
Ready?
Alright, fire away, Poorboy.
Ooh! That's good.
All right, what you may find is you concentrate.
The ticking of your biological clock.
How you probably couldn't afford that nice, new suede coat on a.
How you threw away a promising career in medicine....
Getting into the heart of a global conspiracy.
Your obscenely You mean they don't believe you. You said on the report that at the time of the accident you But this person saved your life. Is that right? You have any idea who it is? A GI? He speaks to you. Asked by whom, Captain? What, we didn't sign in at the front desk? General. I guess this isn't a good time to thank you for seeing us. Well, according to him, he was prevented from doing so by Before throwing himself into a wood chipper on the hospital You really think the General's got something to hide? You don't think he's just closing ranks to protect his men? What's that? Why would he do that? Because they were his soldiers and he feels somewhat Maybe he knows the deeper secrets to their madness, You know, what I can't figure out is why a man who so I talked with security personnel. Other than Captain Draper, General, do you have a family of your own? If the pattern we've seen is at all consistent, you and your Keep an eye out. Watch for anything out of the ordinary. This is a military base, Scully. There's security everywhere It also fits the MO of Lt. Col. Stans' phantom killer. Well, just a word to the wise, Sir. Any unusual or unexplained phenomena. Again? This happen before? Did you save the other ones? Have you noticed any other kind of electrical interference? You'd better call the police, General. No. But I'm really beginning to like the tune. Really? Where? Want me to go run 'em? Hands up. Hands up. Put your hands over your head. Put your hands down behind your back. General and Mrs. Thomas Callahan... No! How did he do it, Quinton? How did he get past the guards? How did he kill him? What does that mean, you're just the mailman? He said he was the mailman. What did he mean by that? I'll catch up with you later. How did it happen? Had anybody been in the cell with him? Not likely. Yeah. He had help. Scully, and he wasn't lying because I Yeah. You see this? This is an X-ray dental plate. No, actually, the ones I've been walking around with I had See, this is the one I was carrying when we first met From Stans' phantom soldier. I came down here wondering Practitioners claim that during a self hypnotic trance, Well, maybe he needs a psychic connection to a place. Sometimes the only sane response to an insane world Do you know anything about backwards masking? Yeah, or on the General's answering machine. Leonard Trimble? He's dead. Why did you kill him? I read your medical record, Leonard. We know that you Maybe because you don't need it. Because you can Like kill General Callahan's boy? Lt. Col. Stans' family? Oh, I'm a trip, because I figured you out? You're a soldier. So you took theirs. No sleepwalking. Call General Callahan... tell him to stay out of his house.
Scully? No, I don't think so. General Callahan! General Callahan?! General Callahan... are you hurt? No evidence was found linking Leonard Trimble to the Leonard Trimble's family requested his burial at Arlington Amputees sometimes feel the pain of phantom limbs... Is it not possible that Trimble developed a phantom soul?
Leonard Trimble was a casualty of the Where are you, Scully? Did you find anything? What's wrong? You're looking for a bomb. I think they have that covered. Boom. Whatever happened to playing a hunch, Scully? The element What makes you think I'm bored? Maybe we should call in a bomb threat to Houston. It's locked? No, you didn't. You had nothing. Come on, I saw you jiggle the handle. You've never seen me panic. When I panic, I make this face. You didn't see that face. What? Coke, Pepsi, saline IV? Scully, I found the bomb. I'm in the vending room. Yeah, you gotta get somebody to open that door. Look, Scully, it's in the soda machine, you've got about Thirteen fifty-six, thirteen fifty-four, thirteen fifty-two, Scully, you know that face I just showed you?
Tell me that's Somebody's got to stay with you. We got less than four minutes to find out if you're right. Something's wrong. Something's not right. Next time, you're buying. Excuse me, excuse me, the firemen and the young boy, We'd been told the building was clear. About what?
She was with me. They want to blame us? If they want somebody to blame, they can blame me, I breached protocol. I broke contact with the SAC. No. Whatever you told them in there, Scully, you don't have to They're trying to divide us on this and we can't let them. What? What are you talking about? But they're the ones who put us together. This is not about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
You're quitting. What do I do? I'm the key figure in an on-going government charade, Does what? You know, one is the loneliest number. What?
Do I know you? You come out here for a reason? Am I supposed to know that name? All right. How'd ya find me? You a reporter? You've got something to tell me, you've got as much time as What's that?
He just let it explode in his face, huh? The federal building was too well guarded. Before the bomb went off? Darius Michaud was a twenty-two-year veteran of the Bureau. You're telling me they blew up that entire building just to hide I think you're full of shit. Arlington, please. Kurtzweil still standing Awww, I woke you...
Did I wake you? Why not? It's three in the morning... I... I... I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah. What exactly are you implying? No, get dressed, Scully. Get dressed. Just get dressed, I'll explain on the way. We're going down to the morgue. On whose orders? General McAddie is who requested our coming down here. Well, call General McAddie.
Well, then call the switchboard, they'll patch you through. Jesus, you don't know the switchboard number? Listen, son, we don't have time to dick around while you Thank you.
Why is a morgue suddenly off. According to the toe tag.
Cause of death. Does this fit the description you just read me? It's like jelly. You're telling me the cause of death on that report is false? I've been told as much. I don't know, but I have a hunch that what you're gonna find We are being blamed for this man's death, I'd like to know.
Think that's it up here. Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? Yeah, I'm looking for him. What's that? Yeah...
I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
No, don't bother..
Not according to the men in blue. They want to discredit you, for what? Oh, that end-of-the-world apocalyptic garbage you write?
How? How were you right? Yeah, it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the You're saying it wasn't such a small outbreak. Well, what was it? What was it? What killed those men? A plague? Negotiating with whom? And they call me paranoid.
Hey, Scully, it's me... Why are you whispering? What did you find? What kind of infection? All right, listen to me. I'm going home and then I'm booking I need you there with me. I need your expertise. I can get you back in time for that hearing, maybe with This has nothing to do with common sense. Scully? Well, I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary really. Maybe. Well, anything from those offices that you haven't send off Have you examined them? I'd like you to let this person take a look at them, I thought you said you weren't coming. And what did you find? How was it contracted?
You said you knew the location where these were found? This is where he marked on the map. Where he said those And you've never seen that virus before. Look at that. That look like new grass to you? Uh huh. Ground's dry about an inch down. This was laid recently. No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. Hey! Hey! You see anybody diggin' over there? Nobody? The same nobody that built that playground? How do you know?
Hey, you wanna buy a badge? Unmarked tanker trucks. What are archeologists hauling And where are they going with it? What are my choices? Well, which way do you think they went? I think they went left. Five years together, Scully. How many times I been wrong? I was right about the bomb, wasn't I? What?
We're not chasing tanker trucks, Scully, we're chasing That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something. Well, they may be hauling a virus in these tanker trucks.
The virus may be extraterrestrial. I have no idea. Very weird. Well, those could be giant Jiffy-Pop Poppers. For the purpose of what? You hear something? You hear that? Umm-hmm.
Maybe... Maybe not. Scully? Run!! Scully! Grab my hand! Did you get stung? Talk to me, Scully! Sculllllllyyyyy! Dammit! Scully! Sculllllllyyyyy! Can you hear me?!!!! Scully! Scully! Scully! Scully! Scully, talk to me!!! Come on. Yeah. On the Texas border, some kind of experiment, I'm not sure... a virus, I think. Yeah, but we were chased off. There were bees... corn crops... What are they? A transportation system. Transgenetic crops that are Guess? What do you mean your guess?! Hey! You told me you had answers!
You didn't know my father?
You've been using me! You've been using me Kurtzweil? Kurtzweil! Your ass?! I just got chased through Texas by two black What's wrong? You can't quit now, Scully. We are close to something here! After what you saw last night, after all you've seen, I need you on this, Scully. You wanna tell yourself that so you can quit with a clear But you saved me! As difficult and as frustrating as it's I don't know if I wanna do this alone... I don't even know.
I'm sorry. Must've gotten in your shirt. What? What? Scully... Scully... I think you're going into anaphylactic shock..
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder, She said she had a funny taste in the back of her throat. Will you tell that to the doctor? What hos... what hospital are... Oh my God. Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, Toto! What am I doing here?
Where's Scully?! I've got to get to her. You don't understand, this goes all the way back to Dallas. I don't know where she is! But I can think of someone You can strip Byers naked! I need your clothes.
It's Mulder. What happened to Kurtzweil? I want to know where Scully is. What is it? You're lying.
A virus... This is what you've been conspiring to conceal?
What do you mean walked? To save your own asses. But he sacrificed my sister. He let them take Samantha. So she would survive. As a genetic hybrid. Why are you telling me this? Where's Dr. Kurtzweil?
I'd like to get Ow! Why? The upholstery is already ruined. What do you mean, may have? Oh, shit! Scully? Breathe! Scully, can you breathe?! I'm going to get you out of there. We gotta keep moving. Come on! Yeah, you can. Scully, reach up and grab that vent! Scully, grab the vent!
Scully? Please, breathe. Breathe... breathe... BREATHE! Breathe in, breathe in, breathe! Grab the vent. Pull! PULL! Keep moving, Scully! Go! Go! Come on! Almost there, keep going! Scully, ya gotta see this! Scully! There's an interesting work of fiction on page 24. You're wasting your time, Scully. They'll never believe you, No. No. How many times have we been here before, Scully? No it isn't! You were right to want to quit! You were right What's up, doc? Eyes in the back of my head, Scully. Auf einer Wellenlänge, as the Germans say. It's a precognitive state often confused with simple human intuition, in which the brain perceives the deep logic underlying transitory human existence, unaided by the conscious mind, materializing much as you did just now. Though if you'd actually materialized, you'd be rapidly de-materializing. But who believes that crap anymore? Well, I hope you told them go screw themselves. The FBI will forgive me. They put me on trial on bogus charges and tried to discredit a decade of my work, they should be asking me for my forgiveness, Scully. How can I possibly help these people? It's a trick, Scully, to smoke me out. Oh good, because I am just as happy having them out of mine. I'm fine here. Happy as a clam. Shit.
Okay, I'll go. Under one condition. Thanks for the lift. Trust being what it is, what if I can't help you? Or your agent turns up dead? Where? Is it a match for evidence found at or near the crime scene? Blood or tissue? I take it you were led to it. By someone claiming psychic powers. And you think he's full of shit. Psychic. And he tells you she's alive. Have you found any other connection? He's a religious man, clearly educated man. He took right action, said nothing to cast doubt upon himself, has no material connection to the crime. You are wasting time, only it's mine and your agents'.
If you have no reason to doubt the man, why doubt the man's visions? This is not an exact science. If it were me, I'd be on the guy 24/7, I'd be in bed with him kissing his holy ass. Maybe I'd stay out of bed with him. Just avoid the activities room. That's a colorful way of putting it. I'm sure you do. You call them visions. You see them? What do you see? But you see her alive. Can you show us how you do it? So much for kissing his holy ass. No, you were good in there. All I had were questions. But you pushed him, you challenged him. Like old times. You could be right, Scully. You could be right. But what if you're wrong? Going to take him for a ride, see just how psychic this Father Joe really is. Scully. Nobody's going to make you sit next to him. I want you here. These people need my help. I could really use yours. That's all right. Everybody works differently. I'm the non-cop. There's always something, however small. I once investigated a series of cases involving unexplained phenomena for the FBI. Let's just say I want to believe. It was a long time ago. I want him to see the crime scene. Pulled that right out of his ass. Yeah, but, why? Why do it? Why go to such great lengths to create such an elaborate fiction. A rather odd way to impress the Holy See. So you think he's guilty too, huh? But you found no connection to the crime. But you don't, or I wouldn't be here. I wasn't exactly Miss Popularity at the FBI myself. Yeah, well. I'm only half the team. Father Joe? I can feel you thinking. Actually, I have a little something for that. Thank you. What's the matter? Why haven't you told me about this before? There's not? And do you think God is losing any sleep? How old is he? I think our son left us both with an emptiness that can't be filled. Just go to sleep. Let me curse God for a while. What? Why is that weird? Now I can't sleep. What is animal tranquilizer doing in the tissue sample of a man's severed arm? He said he heard barking dogs. Father Joe. Is it a tranquiliser that you might give a dog? When I see a man cry tears of blood at a crime scene he recognizes without ever having visited, I need to go out on a limb, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, some trick, huh? How do you fake that? They find her? What? Tell me. Tell me what you see. Who? Who is it? Scully, what does he mean like through dirty glass? What. Okay, just feel free to give up like everybody else. No, that's right, that's right, you're just like my booking agent now, right? What do you mean, it's your fault. No, no. It was the right thing to do, Scully. My sister is dead. I need those men back! I'm trying to ignore you. We need shovels. No, it's dirty glass. Flashlight. You're going to need resources. Come on, pick up. Come on. Come on, answer. Scully, it's me. I keep leaving you messages. Here's what I want to tell you. That woman's head in the ice? It's not the agent's, it's not Monica Bannan's. We don't know who she is or why she's there, but so far we've pulled eleven discrete human limbs from the ice and we're not even done yet. Each one a clean cut too, an exact match to the previous amputation you noted, Scully. It looks like someone's been dumping body parts in the ice there for months, possibly years. And there seems to be no pattern to the limbs, men and women, all with healthy, undiseased tissue according to forensics. Which suggests to me that they are victims. But here's the thing, what I need you to know, we found more traces of your animal tranquillizer, Acepromazine. I don't know what the hell it means but I'm hoping you can make sense of it. No, I can't reach her. But this is going to make sense. This is a break, I'm feeling it. No, no, this is a serial case you've uncovered here. You're going to solve a dozen murders here. Well, we're going to find her. I know it. Is she with Monica Bannan?
Is it the same men that took her? You see this? Or you just telling these people what they want to hear? No, you don't see it? I want a car ready. I don't know yet. That's been your problem from the start. And a list of missing persons in the greater area over the last 48 to 72 hours. Pretty hard left turn for such a long straight stretch of country road, don't you think? But why settle for my opinion. Whoa, whoa. We're not quite finished. It's a medical I.D. bracelet. I noticed that your missing agent wore one too. Let's pop the trunk. Her gym bag. It's her bathing suit. It's frozen stiff. Where's the nearest public pool? People say I went underground. It's the boy, isn't it. I thought there was nothing to be done. Last night you said that wasn't an option. What changed your mind? When will you know if it's working? There's another woman missing. She's given us something to go on. She and the missing agent swam at the same pool. We found that the agent kept a locker there, we think they were.
stalked there. Both women wore medical I.D. bracelets, and they both had the same rare blood type - AB negative. Black market. Somebody filling orders. That's your world, Scully. Your knowledge able to save time, and time is our enemy. No, no, I need you on this with me. Yeah, you asked me to get involved, Scully. Now I'm asking for you stay involved. We're so close now. It's not that simple. What's that's supposed to mean? What? Just say it. I know that. I'm fine with it, Scully. I'm actually okay. I'm good. Where else would you have me look if you want me to find these women alive? Why? I don't think I'm the one who's changed. Scully, this is who I am. It's who I've always been. This is who I was before I met you. It's what I do, it's everything I know. You're asking me to give up? Scully. Don't do this. Don't do this now. Good luck, then. What happened? Who called you? Well, what are you doing here?
We need to talk to Father Joe. It's the man in his visions, Scully. The suspect, the man in this photo. Tell me again what you're doing here. Who's this? Known him how? Hey! Hey! Hey!
Look, I don't need the sweet talk. Father Joe led us here. Now what do you think? Hey! Stop him! I'm up here! He's coming at you! Yeah?! Right here! No. I lost him. Where? They're both dead. Monica Bannan and Dakota Whitney.
I thought we were winning, Scully. I'm here to see Father Joe. I want to show him these photographs. These men.
I just want to be sure. Are you sure? That second victim may be alive. Everybody's given up on her, but I'm not going to. It's like you said, it's why we can't be together. Hey! Hey, sorry to bother you. No, I just need a moment of your time. Yeah, I was wondering if you carry an animal tranquillizer called Acepromazine.
No, I don't. Can you tell me if you've ever sold any to this man. I'm just... Yeah, it's me.
I must be busy right now. Leave a message. Stop what you're doing. Stop! Back off!
Back away! Back off! You speak English? Anybody speak English? I want her out of here. I want those tubes out of her neck and I want her neck sewn up. Do it! Do it!! Are you going to do what I say! Sorry about your car. The girl is still inside. The girl inside. Skinner? I'm cold. What's up, doc? Did you see this story? The FBI's claiming Father Joe was an accomplice. Not a word about his.
psychic connection.
I know, Scully, and I can prove it. Father Joe died of lung cancer, right? The same as that man that Dr. Frankenstein tried to give a new body. What time did you pull those tubes from that woman's neck. What time did you cut off the blood supply to that man's head? That's when Father Joe died. You get me his death certificate and I'll show it to you, and then I'll take it to the FBI and I'll show them. It's an injustice to the man's name. I thought you believed him too. Why don't you just tell me what he said to you. What if Father Joe's prayers were answered after all? What he were forgiven, because he didn't give up. Scully? Why would he say that - Don't give up? Why would he say such a thing to you?
He didn't say it to me. He said it to you. If Father Joe were the devil, why would he say the opposite of what the devil might say? Maybe that's the answer. The larger answer.
Don't give up.
If you have any doubts, any doubts at all, just call off that surgery this morning. And then we'll get out of here. Just me and you. I'm not sure it works that way. I think maybe the darkness finds you and me. But let it try.
What do you think, Scully, is this a name, possibly?
Or a code, or an.
Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here.
Lousy spelling aside, what do you think it refers to?
Who's the thief?
You see that, Scully, you always keep me guessing.
This is Dr. Irving Thalbro, age 66.
Found hanged with his throat cut.
His.
Except they're the ones that called it in and there's no evidence whatsoever.
Except who, then.
Oh, there is one detail that does.
This.
Dirt.
It's a very powerful component of hexcraft.
As well as the pattern in.
Looks like a human form.
Yeah, that's what it looks like to me.
Now, I know what you're going to.
Dr. Wieder, do you have any enemies?
I'm sorry, I have to ask. There was a message left behind.
If it doesn't refer.
Hey, Scully.
This dirt we found?
Gas chromatograph shows pronounced spikes of.
Go ahead, Scully, keep me guessing.
The, the, the, uh...
the disease that New Guinea tribesmen get?
And I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad.
Kuru makes you crazy, right?
Unless...
it was inflicted upon him.
The graveyard dirt, the hex.
He was.
Dr. Wieder?
I take it that's rare.
Maybe the rarer, the better.
Someone directed this to happen to your wife, just as someone directed.
The dirt you found in your bed drawn in the shape of a body.
That's.
I was actually thinking less Eastern and more Celtic.
Maybe... Scots-Irish or Appalachian, even.
If we don't stop who's causing this, your treatments won't matter.
Oh, he will lose unless we can find a way to stop it.
A second opinion.
Yeah, we're looking for some alternative medical advice.
Conjure dust... Goofer dust.
How would you go about making somebody.
We're investigating a murder.
That's why I'm asking.
So you could give them any illness you wanted?
One that you chose.
How would you counteract one of these?
And you still have no idea why?
The pathologist found this branded into your wife's.
chest.
Her father doesn't agree.
He thinks you robbed him of his family, and that's why he's systematically.
You don't do anything.
You let us find a way to protect you.
I have an idea where to start.
Better known to the world as Jane Doe 6149..
Deepest Appalachia.
Well, I'm thinking of her dear old backwoods Dad and where he gets all his.
The cultists we spoke to said that the person casting these magic spells was.
That's my guess.
So as long as her body remains here resting in peace in.
Hold that.
All right, thank you.
They'll be there before dark.
You all set?
We rented a cabin for you.
It's important that you get out of town.
Because he hasn't gotten everything he wants.
Peattie may be on to us.
I found out where he lives only he's cleared out, and he's taken.
Just keep an eye out, Scully.
I'm on my way.
Lynette Peattie's body is on its way back home to Indiola, West Virginia.
Mm-hmm.
It seems pretty clear-cut.
You're wondering if maybe Peattie could've saved her life?
You do keep me guessing.
Yeah.
For a guy who was, uh... in a coffin not too long ago I think I'm.
Uh-oh.
Wow.
Like Austin Powers.
Mmm.
Something looks different.
Ah... that's it.
Missing a molly.
Well, you act like you're surprised.
In more ways than one.
I'm happy for you.
I think I know... how much that means to you.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be cold or ungrateful.
I just... I have no idea.
Kersh wants to put me behind a desk?
That is not what Kersh wants.
And you by putting you in this position.
And Agent Scully, for not giving.
Scully, you're going to give birth in a couple months.
You can talk as tough.
Agent who?
Mission accomplished.
Does he know what he's doing at all, this guy?
I see.
Then maybe the question is not who fired this magic bullet, but.
Well, good.
At least he's manoeuvrable.
I'm going to get dressed.
For the first time I feel like getting back to work.
Hey.
Who says you can't go home again?
What's it look like?
Hey, I am just down here visiting my buds. Where is this Agent Doggett.
Why?
Anything to do with this?
This Absalom abductee class picture?
Because I noticed that the man who was shot on the White House lawn is.
Consider that a freebie.
The next one's going to cost you.
Oh, I don't know anything.
But you know me, I got a real big hunch.
This.
I think they killed him for it.
Once again, I'm a betting man.
I'm betting he had more than that.
Ooh.
There's that word again.
Do you want to hear something really paranoid?
The FBI gets its way.
Really?
When I was dead I was hoping maybe they changed the rules.
Then why don't you shut the door so he doesn't find out.
Neither do I, really.
But maybe it's like Howard Salt's picture.
I'll know it.
You don't get it, do you, Scully?
The man shot at the White House, the.
Since when has an X-File not defied a certain standard of credibility?
At.
Look, Scully, I need to make sense of what happened to me.
So that I can.
Yeah, well, compared to where I just was, prison would be a Princess.
Ho.
Hey.
What the hell is this?
The entire hard drive is taken up with this.
Ten gigabytes of memory.
Mm.
I'm going to book myself on that Princess cruise.
Sir.
Is this John Doggett?
You Agent Doggett?
I hope you're not commending him as a hero for what he did....
... in this thing, 'cause he's not.
The problem? You occupy an office that used to be devoted to finding the.
You got that man killed.
Because of what he knew.
What he was going to expose.
I see you sitting there, Agent Doggett.
That's good enough for me.
Melvin.
I'd be a whole lot happier to see you if you'd just take your hands.
Downloaded from where?
All right, what are you waiting for, boys?
Get cracking.
Well, why do that?
Because I'm right.
Because they would kill to protect what's in those files.
Oh.
I see.
Somebody's been doing a little campaigning for her cause.
Well, just remember, boys, this is America.
Just because you get more.
Scully, what are you doing back?
Did something just happen?
Scully, if you know something that can get us moving forward again, you.
Frohike?
Langly? Byers?
Let's go.
I'm dying out here.
Is the system bypassed?
Great.
Come on, guys.
I'm on autopilot here.
Hey, who's working on the locks, fellas?
Let's do some e-mailing.
Just a fly buzzing around the window.
I think you're trying to keep this information from ever seeing the light of.
Well, you're about to, along with a lot of other people.
There going to learn.
What are you going to do, shoot me?
Why?
You son of a bitch. You set me up.
Hey, get off of me.
Yeah, I'm here.
Except what?!
Yeah, in the time that you worked with... Ms.
Hey, Scully maybe if we get really lucky.
No. That would make way too many people way too happy.
Just you?
Don't.
Hmm?
Being nosy.
Eating my heart out.
That's not what I'm reading.
I'm thinking murder by telekinesis.
So they're splitting us up, huh?
No?
Who told you that?
Obviously, if you do a good job they're not.
Right?
A pleasure to meet you,... Peyton.
How's your X-File coming?
You can't hold him?
What about the stabbing?
I told you I'm nosy.
Why are you letting him go?
But you still think Fellig's a murderer, huh?
As in he, uh, plugs up like a cork when you stab him?
Well, young man Ritter has been sending progress.
Come on. It's, you know... it's what I do now.
I'm.
Hey, Scully, uh, how's that X-File coming?
And before.
What happened?
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's not surprising, given that.
I did a little low-tech.
background check on him. This.
You think? Because this Henry Strand does not exist.
I think that's what he wants you to think.
Now we're.
Mulder.
Hi.
Yeah. Henry Srand and L.H. rice.
Uh, no, but there's a... there's, like, a big gap.
Absolutely, yeah.
Agent Ritter, it's Agent Mulder.
Is Agent Scully there.
Me neither, and D.C. Cellular says her phone is turned.
Well, you can find her for me.
Good, because that's where I think she is. And you were.
1929.
Look, Ritter.
don't sweat the math. It's him. Just get.
You're a lucky man.
Coroner's report came back on Fellig.
Says he died of a single.
No, no, I... I think he would have.
I just think that... that I do. I'm a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Yes, I have. These murders span nearly a century. Nineteen homicides, five I contend that perhaps through genetic mutation, Eugene Tooms A preliminary examination done at the time of Tooms' arrest I must ask that you place the safety of......the people first and foremost... This is a rare and unusual human creature......who should not be released, but should be retained for further If you release Eugene Tooms, he will kill again. It's in his I don't care how it sounded as long as it was the truth. What did he want? I'm not taking my eyes off him. He needs to kill, he'll do it the first chance he can but he No, I'll watch him. If he can't be tied to the most recent evidence, There's no statute of limitation on murder. Look, Scully, if you're resistant because you don't believe, Excuse me. F.B.I. It's not enough. It doesn't tie it to Tooms. Pine-scented. Better? Ha-ha. Article 30, paragraph 8.7? A request for other agents to stake-out Tooms would be denied. They're out to put an end to the X-Files, Scully. I don't know And I... I even made my parents call me Mulder. So... Mulder. If there's an ice tea in that bag, could be love. Here. Take my sandwich, I only had one bite. You're gonna want Yeah. A good forensic scientist would know that there is not only Of course. That's a good idea. Thanks for your concern. Tooms will never voluntarily submit to a dental cast. That makes five. Where he's gone for the last ninety years, 66 Exeter Street. What's there now? Thanks. You can get the next mutant. It's amazing how things change, isn't it? No, a change for us. It's coming. A hunch. Arthur Dales?
I'm a profiler with the I brought the case file here with me. It's, uh... it's an unsolved case. Mr. Dales, most of your report has been censored... as you Yes. last week. Shot to death by a sheriff serving an eviction.
Sir, sir, m-my name is Mulder.
Uh... I'm sorry, sir.
Dad.
Good morning, Edward Skur died saying a name...my name. My father's name. My father and I don't really speak.
Mr. Dales, I want the truth, and I will The man that Edward Skur killed 38 years ago...was my How?
The coroner wasn't able to determine how. You said in your report that uh, Skur was suspected of being.
I can't believe my Skur died saying my father's name. Why?
Well, there was, um... there was one.
Why would anyone do that? Why let a killer go free?
Yes, we should... but not for this.
Now this is, uh, Raybert.
No, I don't think so.
Whoever did it took 40 minutes to do it in.
There's, um... no acid found in his.
Scully...!
Dear Diary.
Today my heart leapt when Agent Scully suggested.
I don't have a theory.
But I know of someone who does.
An inmate.
Rawls was the prisoner who supposedly died in the tornado that.
I disagree.
I think.
I can't argue with that.
But I.
Termites?
Well, it's not in here.
Hey.
Look at this.
Ouch.
I wonder who she is.
Is that the guy?
How'd he get away?
You had him handcuffed...
Here.
Can I.
We have a last known address for Pinker Rawls?
This is Rawls's last known address.
Security guard's car.
Ugh!
Don't recognize him from his driver's license, do you?
Yeah, but Rawls used to live here and he's come back looking for.
I don't think he spent that in prison.
Maybe she knows.
That's this house, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet Rawls is looking for her.
Maybe she changed her name.
Maybe she was afraid she'd end up.
You might warn them not to shoot to kill. He seems to find that.
They are.
It's just that their composition has been changed just.
I think they just went right through him, - whsssht - like his.
Changing their composition fundamentally... making steel brittle.
I don't know how else to explain what happened to that prison.
I'm not saying that it can't be explained.
Okay, we both agree on who he's looking for?
And do we have any idea of how to find June Gurwitch?
Where'd he go?
Bo Merkle's car is parked down the street.
That's how he got.
Why would he leave without getting the information he wanted?
Where to?
June?
Who is Rawls to you?
What does Rawls want?
The money?
$90,000 from the Bay Saint.
And where's the money now?
Give me your keys.
Get her out of here.
I want a guard on her at all times.
Yeah. And we took him right where he wanted to go.
You think he's trying to tell us something?
Scully, look at this.
I'm assuming Rawls wrote this with his.
Or the mirror stopped him.
What makes an object solid, Scully?
Electrons. What if Rawls's ability somehow has to do electricity?
Exactly. Rawls couldn't pass through this.
It's not about the money.
It's never been about.
Pregnancy.
This is seven years ago.
That's just a few months after Rawls was.
Where are they headed?
Yeah, we got to get there first.
I'm going to need some equipment.
Special.
It was a live birth... that's all you can tell me?
Yes. Thank you.
Riot slugs....
Rubber.
No official files.
No adoption records.
no records of foster.
Jackie, this is Agent Mulder....
Get him out of here, Scully.
Don't make me shoot you.
Don't make me shoot you.
Maybe another chance.
Hey... My name's not Jerry. My name's Mulder. Fox Mulder. I got ID in my pocket.
Never heard of it? You never heard of the FBI? Where are you taking me? What are you talking about?
Deutschland Uber Alles? Wait a second. What? I think there's been a mistake. I think the mistake is mine. This is the Queen Anne, isn't it? Hey, just about enough of that. I came looking for this ship. Hold on a second. I think I can explain what's going on. What's our current position? I'll tell you. I'll tell you. We're two degrees above the 30th Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that you haven't been able to.
You can relax. There's no war going on. It's okay. The war's over. Let them take you to Germany.
This is unbelievable.
Mayday, mayday. This is Special Agent Fox Oh, sh.... What the hell is going on? Spender?
Hi. Scully?
Scully.
I had to steal this uniform.
You see, I told you. You're all big men now but wait until you get into Russia. Same to you, Adolf! You... No sprechen. I don't speak Nazi.
Wait a minute. Why are you shooting me?
Skinner? Where are they taking me? I got two words for you, buddy... Pearl Harbor. After Poland, Hitler's on his way to Denmark, Holland and Yeah, you come out on the side of history with no small You speak German. What was that shouting about up there? Are we? But the Captain knew something. He wouldn't give up Hey, this ship can't go to Germany. I got news for you... you're not carrying munitions. Thor's Hammer isn't a weapon. It's a man, a man who will I saw him in the ballroom. Listen to me! Listen to me! You can't take this ship to You can't take the ship to Jamaica, either. The Germans My name's Mulder. No, I want you to take this ship and turn it back around You've got to turn the ship around. The future. Actually, the past. Well, I can explain it to you.
Turn the ship around.
I don't know.
I don't know. None. I'll answer the question. That man is the scientist.
I told you, this man is the scientist. John Brown. Ask me again, and I'll knock you down. Puddintame. Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.
That's great. What'd he say? Uh...I think I know what he said. The engines shut down. Hey! Come with me. 'Cause you're the only one who can save this ship.
Come on. Come on... Come on! I'm going to tell you how to save this ship. I can't stay. I got to get back to history.
And you got to rescue it. Wait. You know Einstein, right? He predicts the theoretical If you don't go back and convince the crew of this ship to In all likelihood, I won't exist. And neither will you. So, in case we never meet again... I was expecting a left.
Where am I?
Ooooo. I feel... Like hell. What happened to me? What did I do? Say that again? You were there. You were there, Scully.
And he was there, too. No, you were there with the Nazis. You saved the world, Scully. No, no, no... The Queen Anne... I found it. You were there No, no, no. You and I were on that ship, Scully. In 1939. I would've never seen you again. But you believed me. Mmm.
Hey, Scully.
I love you. We can't go in too soon. We have to be patient, it'll happen. I've received receipts over the past few weeks for detonation.
I've received two new receipts, one for first and last.
Hold it.
I counted two men. Get out of the truck. Get out of the truck! Let me see your hands! Hands in the air! You son of a bitch! Oh, come on, Krycek! I'm sure you had no trouble adapting. You're full of crap, Krycek. You're an invertebrate scum-sucker Then why don't you put a bullet in his head like you did that.
The only thing that will destroy this man is the truth.
We can't help you Krycek. There it is, Air Lacayo, 6.
Fifteen minutes ago.
Come Show him. Expose it for him, Scully. What did you get for Halloween, Charlie Brown? I need to speak with you, sir. I need your authorization to provide a safe house.
But you have an idea, don't you?
Is it valuable? I think we'd all like to know what's in that rock. Big dead end at the State Department, but U.S. Customs officials Yes, which leads me to believe what's in this rock we intercepted Why all this effort to get it onto U.S. soil? I think what Alex Who wants to expose the same men that we do and will go to any I'm with Scully. We're on our way out to NASA-Goddard. Explain yourself about what? Pull over here. I'm gonna take a cab. I want you to find out about that rock. Call me as soon as you We're going to walk out of here like nothing happened. If anybody Who is he? Yeah? What is it? I think you better find out. I want you to get me an address Fox Mulder. I need your help. FBI database. I'm sorry, it's a matter of extreme urgency. A Krasnoyarsk? That's just north of Tunguska. Yeah. My cell phone. I gotta book myself on a flight to Krasnoyarsk, Find my cell phone? Why? Why are you helping me? How long will it take? Making travel arrangements.
To follow the pouch. Yeah. I'm leaving the window rolled down. If I'm not back in a week, What did you say to me? You called me a bad name. Let's go.
June 30, 1908. Tungus tribesmen and Russian fur traders look It's been speculated that it was a piece of a comet, an asteroid, I think somebody found that evidence. And the explanation is Looks like some kind of mining camp. Oh!
I don't think they're miners. Run! I don't speak Russian. Told me what? I wasn't brought here.
I came here looking for something. What is this place? How do you know? To what? What did you tell them? What are you saying? Who are you? Why are you here? What kind of experiment? NO!
Game.
Hey, Homegirl, word up.
Oh.
Scully, I got game.
No, I'm ready to JOB just not on some jagoff shoeshine tip.
No background checkin' jagoff shoeshine tip.
About what?
You looking for work, Agent Spender?
'Cause if you are, I got a.
They found your mother.
I didn't hear the magic word.
Are you asking me, Agent Spender?
The truth is out there, Agent Spender.
Maybe you should find it.
Where did you expect to find me?
It wasn't exactly an offer.
It is an opportunity made to order for the powers that be.
This is exactly the kind of mistake they've been waiting for to LIKE I SAID.
not exactly.
I know.
I have no doubt that what Cassandra would tell us would expose more.
Shh.
Shhh.
Shhhh.
Don't... don't do that.
Look at you.
Well, I had reasons for doubt when I met you, Cassandra.
Then where is she?
What?
What are they here for?
It's the virus....
the black oil.
And you know who these men are?
They're going to be monitoring any work on our machines, in or out.
Smokey's got a name.
Who?
What's that?
What's it stand for?
Scully, you want to go one-on-one?
We got nothing but time now.
Nothing you could ever find would be accurate or credible.
That's C.G.B. Spender and my father.
That's the same night as my sister.
The project is still going on.
Thanks for coming.
I know it's late and you've been.
Her life's been in danger going on 30 years... just not the way I.
Men who've conducted medical experiments in what began as a secret.
To develop alien human hybrids that will survive the viral.
Files that Agent Scully dug up that make all the right connections.
The Smoking Man.
I know that Agent Scully has her doubts about the purposes of these.
Because I believe Cassandra Spender represents the final stages of.
Because... the men who created her would rather kill her than let.
Assigned by Agent Spender?
Cassandra?
How did you get here?
How did you get out of your room?
Let go!
Stand away, Scully. He's here. I feel him. Don't take your eyes off him, Scully. Not yet.
I got him.
He's got a gun! I can't see him. I can't see him. What if Private Burkholder's telling the truth, that he's You mean there's no procedure outlined for an invisible He passed. Yeah. I found his story compelling, personally, but then Mr. Markham? It's extremely urgent that we talk to you right now, sir. There goes the neighborhood. What's your word on this? I'd like to ask you that. He told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet. He says that's who killed General MacDougal. Left for dead? When was this photo taken? Well, what if he's telling the truth? Maybe the war ain't over, Scully. Well, given the facts of the case and Private Burkholder's.
Well, there is that possibility, too. What if he passes? Yeah, and more copies to distribute. I thought she ID'd Teager? Because his name's on the wall? They have his remains? Why go to all that trouble? You say he just disappeared? Scully? Can we give Mrs. Davenport an eye exam? By all accounts, the man we're looking for - the man she And how did she reach that emotional state? I'm gonna see if we're really chasing a dead man. Yes. This was all that was left of Teager at the crash site? Is there any way to tell how the teeth were extracted?
Can you tell if that was Well then this is presumptive, isn't it? A finding of death Whoever signed off on this death chose to ignore the facts, Is there any other way to tell? General Steffan, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the That the person or persons responsible for the murder of Based on a death certificate that you may have put your Listen, sir, I'm ten minutes away. I gonna have to ask you OK, do you know your driver, sir? Good. I'm gonna put two FBI agents there to escort you.
Mulder. Did you find out what caused her eye to hemorrhage? Scotoma? Well, what would cause that? Well, don't you think it's odd, Scully, that she'd have a Well, that might account for Teager's vanishing. Oh, hold on second, Scully. Where are you? All right. The agents that I assigned to you - are they with I want you to call them into your office right now, General. Listen to me very carefully, OK? I'm on my way over there. General Steffan? General Steffan? Call an ambulance. The general's secretary had been in here organizing his I was on the phone with the man. He was shot at close No scotoma? I think it's beyond all our capabilities, but somebody's got That's him. That's Teager. I did everything I could. I put two agents with him... That's correct, sir. I think that Teager has an ability - the ability to I think he can hide himself from human sight by manipulating You might not be able to see him. Isn't it true that Parade or no parade, those men are gonna be vulnerable. By finding his next victim before he does. Cross-town traffic's all snarled up because of the parade. A man named Teager. Then why did you come here? A POW named Teager may be back home carrying out Generals - Steffan and MacDougal. What is that? Men employed by our government as spies and commandos Are you saying that our government wants these officers.
Well, who's the third man? I need a name. Scully. I heard what happened. They told me you saved They told me you saw somebody on the parade route. You saw him, didn't you? You saw Teager. Yeah, but you drew your gun, Scully. You must have I found out about General Bloch from the same person This case - why do you think it was dumped in your lap, Well, they knew about Teager. They'd known that he'd be And us. Given the nature of the case, they knew that you'd Discrediting us in this case is only secondary. To maintaining their secret policy of denial about POW's, No, no, Denny Markham may be the only man in this case He won't reconsider.
Don't take your eyes off him, Scully. Not yet.
I got him. He's got a gun. I can't see him. Teager's here. I saw him out of the corner of my eye. Where's General Bloch? We've got to stop him. He can only hide himself in somebody's direct line of sight. That's why he killed General MacDougal and Steffan at Get away from the car! He's in the car! Teager's in the Get out of the car with your hands in the air! It's over, The Pentagon is claiming that the man who was killed They must have gotten to him. You heard him! We both did! It's happening all over again. Why not? Don't let them do this. So did Nathaniel Teager. Is that what you believe? Is that what you really believe? What are your thoughts on that, Scully? No, unfortunately. It's going on three days. No, no hair and fiber evidence either. The rain washed it all Don't you see the photo? It was taken by a sixty-five year old druggist moments before That is what you would think. I'm sure you did it just fine.
So which one of us gets to use the stun gun on So you think that would make it look like she posed Oh. I'm not sure I have a theory. Yeah, agents Mulder and Scully. Inspector. Mary LeFante was intercepting them. Yeah, but why would she stab her boyfriend through the ear? What would be the point of that? Here it is.
In the sixties, a bellhop named Ted Serios became kind of Also known as skotographs. The literature on thought Look at that. I think he was here, Scully. Mary LeFante's abductor. I think he stalked her. Meant to conceal what? This isn't about mail fraud, Scully, The fantasy of a killer. The dental anesthetic. Would that account for her condition? What would? What is it? So we're looking for a doctor? Someone with training?
Mary? We better go in there and get her. Charles Selchik, certified public accountant His secretary, Alice Brandt, age 32. Her family confirmed Apparently none, but if the M.O. remains the same... Yeah. I keep thinking about that word that Mary LeFante was That's what I've been thinking. Apparently in German, it means You took German in high school, Scully? Unrest, huh? He wasn't there, Scully. It would have affected the photos. Trott, what did you find? That may be the only evidence we get. What's here for them to find? This guy is obviously very good You may be right, Scully, you should check it out. I'll be back in DC. I want special photo to run this. Well, that's all the more reason to fully investigate the one Can you get rid of the blurriness surrounding her, here? Why do you say that? What about this face, here? Can you bring that up at all? OK, do that. OK, thank you.
NCIC shows no match for that It's the kidnapper's shadow. It's like he's looming over her.
Scully, I may have something for you on the They're unusually long, they're out of proportion. I'm thinking You want to tell us about the first time you were arrested, Gerry? Yeah, Gerald Thomas Schnauz, diagnosed and treated for a Well, how did you feel about that? Says here that you have a sister. Where is your sister, Gerry? Actually, it says here she committed suicide in 1980. Hey, Gerry. This your father? You left it for me. You left it like a fingerprint. Is this what Is that what you see? Gerry... tell me where Alice Brandt is. Gerry... Tell me how I can find her. Hey, Scully, that word unruhe, unrest, is bothering me. Well, then that photo wouldn't be his fantasy. Because I want to know. This wound's in the wrong place. He was shot in the throat. He took the passport camera and all the film in the store. He wants to continue his work. You think you interrupted his stalking? Hold on a second. You bring the car around. I just want to Scully! Scully! Scully! Any sightings? He's switching cars. He's going to do that two or three.
He's got six fingers.
What about What about friends, relatives, co-workers? Does he have a Let me see his wallet.
Recipient of the Bronze Star He was here. Six fingers, right.
Damn it! That's five headstones. And the father makes six. Come on! Fan out. Check the tree line.
Scully! Scully!
Are you hurt?
They're here... They're here... THEY'RE HERE! THEY'RE HERE! No thanks, handsome. So, fellas... You looking for somebody? I don't think it's down here.
Hey, I think we share the same credit union.
What's it to you? Thanks, guys. All right? Yeah, Mulder... Oh hey, Reggie... What's up? Federal agent. Susanne Modeski, you are under arrest for the You three are under arrest also. Ma'am, stay where you are. You three get on the ground now! Ma'am, stop moving. I'm not Federal agent, identify yourself. Step forward and identify yourselves, NOW! They're here. Yeah I am, thank you, I just... mmm... I have these weird Weird ones. I'm not sure yet, I just spoke with my ASAC and he tells me Yeah, I want the truth. What?! Nothing you'd be too terribly interested in Agent Doggett. Looking into the recent death of an oil worker. That's what I'm doing here. Well maybe you missed the fact that this victim's corpse washes ashore in Port Arransis, Texas with massive flash burns on 90% of his body. Then you must also know that this man was not the only man to disappear from the Galpex-Orpheus platform that night, but one of two men. The communications officer is also missing. Burns the M.E. said in his report we not inconsistent to exposure to high levels of radiation. These files include the same kind of radiation phenomenon. Tissue destroyed by exposure to...
And you'd love to help, but you left your lightsaber at home. How'd you get stuck down here, Agent Doggett? Kersh catch you peeing in his cornflakes? Just like old times. Tough crowd. I believe we did speak, yeah. That would have been me as well, Sir, and that was in the best interest of the FBI and Mr. Ortega. I believe. This incident has nothing to do with that whatsoever. It's about the unexplained death of Simon de la Cruz. A criminal investigation isn't doing to clear up anything. I don't think you know exactly what you're dealing with here Sir. This is an X-File. You're talking about an oil rig that's 150 miles out at sea. You can't send a pregnant woman. If you give me a minute, I'm just getting in with details of the investigation. Why don't you pull up a chair and introduce yourself so Mr. Taylor won't have to repeat himself. Communications chief, wasn't he? I guess that's it, in a nutshell. Thank you Mr. Taylor. How are you going to call when the radio's broken? You won't do it. We're both in the same boat, Agent Doggett. We're just paddling in different directions. I don't think Kersh expects you to come back empty handed on this one. Since you have already told me about what you think about this case in so many words, I don't see you coming back with anything that's gonna protect anybody's business interests let alone your own ass. I think he knows that truth about what happened, and he may not be the only one. Really, what stories are those? What church? I got it.
Well I'm sorry, Agent Doggett's gone fishing. Can I take a message please? I was just in the neighbourhood. Kersh doesn't need to know. You need me out here Scully, you know that better than anyone. Who's flouting orders, you found something didn't you, in that victim's body. The virus? Dead? What killed it? That's not possible. We got to quarantine this rig. Scully, if these men are infected the last place we want to is onshore where they can infect other people. You're sitting on the answer right there, Scully. The body, you find the virus, you can find what knocks it out, you can find what kills it.
When he's old enough, tell the kid I went down swinging! Agent Doggett's not here right now. That was Agent Scully. She said it was lucky that I'm out here. Alright, then go ahead and take charge, Only you might not like what it means in this case. What you're going to have to do with that information you're so anxious to have. I've been going over the crew manifest Mr. Sachs, and there appears to be a problem. According to the manifest there's supposed to be eighteen men onboard. I count only seventeen including you.
Diego Garza, where's he? Any idea where he might be?
What do you say we go and find him? I'm hoping to find Diego Garza. Did you see the crew manifest? It listed Diego Garza as mestizo, of mixed Mexican descent, just like his friend who died? Well the crew chief said these mestizo were particularly good workers, but we've got one dead trying to sabotage the rig and another missing. If he's one of their best workers you'd think someone would've noticed him missing. These men are hiding something, but that's not it. I don't know yet. I didn't come out here just to bust your ass. I'm telling you, I've seen this substance. I've seen it can take over a man's body. This crew could be infected and not even know it. They may have no idea they're being controlled. That's not how it works. It body jumps from man to man, and I'm not sure that it's in all oil. The man from Galpex oil lied... No, that new oil field is already in production. It's already being pumped by this rig. That's how this crew got infected. Billions and billions of barrels lying right underneath us, waiting to be produced, waiting to infect that ninety percent of the planet you talked about. Agent Doggett.
what if that's why this man is hiding, this Diego Garza, because he knows what they're up to, and he knows what they're up to because he's the only one who's not infected with this alien virus. It's the radio room! What is it about this room that inspires men to violence? Molotov cocktail anyone? Can I borrow your radio Mr. Sachs?
Agent Doggett, you there?
Agent Doggett. Come in Agent Doggett. Get up, Agent Doggett.
There's more where that came from. You know anything about radio, Agent Doggett?
Let's see what little you know and get that ship-to-shore working. Anybody who can get us off here. Get to work! Agent Doggett! I don't think this door is going to hold much longer. Wagner? I take it back. It's perfect. That's someone knocking on the door. Tell her all the men here are infected. She's got to get the word to the choppers. Not to land on the platform. Well, that problem is rapidly becoming moot! Destroying their ability to transmit just like Diego and Simon de la Cruz. I'm talking about contact. Agent Doggett, listen. No, no, no, listen. I don't know, and I don't want to stick around to find out. Let's go, Agent Doggett. Who? Agent Doggett! Is he coming? Agent Doggett, I think I know why they let us go. They're going to blow the rig. I think he wants us to jump. How about a 20 count? Where's the fire, Agent Doggett? You mean Galpex Oil? That oil should stay right where it is. You should do everything in your power to make sure that it does. That is the Deputy Director calling to tell you there is no need to see you. That the blame has been properly assigned for what happened out on that platform. I'm out. 86'd, Agent Doggett. Kersh could barely contain his happiness. He stuck it to me. For you. For the X-Files. You're all the credibility this office has left. You have Kersh's ear and you have seen it now. Out on that platform. You saw it for yourself. Answer the phone, Agent Doggett. You're in charge here now. Mulder. Oh, my apartment complex was being fumigated so I thought I'd No, just, uh... sitting and thinking. Scully... what are you wearing? Isn't that what, uh, Doctor Zaius said to Charlton Heston at Scully, I got to go. Just sitting, thinking. I heard reports of several UFO sightings in this area last night. Any more calls tonight? No. Oh, I was just knocking off some bugs that landed on my... Maybe, maybe beetles. I dunno, I'm not really good with bugs. What's the matter? I think you better get up here. It appears that cockroaches are mortally attacking people. I'm crouching over a bug exterminator whose recently deceased Miller's Grove. Insect bites? No. Anaphylactic shock? Okay, we'll check that out. No, no, no, I'm sure you're right. Thanks, Scully. My drug dealer. I take it back, Scully, I think you better get up here. Yeah, and this was no allergic reaction. Two witnesses claim We haven't located any yet, but there are wounds all over the Well... the victim did attempt to extract the insects using Uh, well, he did have a homemade lab set up, but I'm not sure Ekbom's Syndrome? No, uh, you're probably right. I'm sorry to bother you. How about some urine? For a drug test. Get me a container. It must have molted. It's just empty exoskeleton. We've got more than that, sheriff. I think that bug's exoskeleton An abrasion caused by a metallic substance? What do you need to tell me? I don't know. I wouldn't know. He's upset that I don't know what's going on here. I see the correlation, but just because I work for the federal Experiments? What are you suggesting? You might want to keep that theory to yourself, sheriff. No I don't see any roaches. Hmm. He doesn't appear odd in any... The medical examiner. His body was found next to a toilet, covered Yeah. Brain aneurysm? Well, how do you explain the roaches, though? Almost. Mulder. Do they attack people? But do they attack people? Well, that all makes perfect sense, Scully. I don't like it It's too late, I'm already inside. I'm a house. It's apparently empty. It's a, uh... typical two-story suburban house. Nice big living Yeah. They're rippling. Cockroaches. They're everywhere. Flashlight went out... Got to go. I'm a federal agent. Agent Mulder, F.B.I. Doctor Berenbaum, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions. What's a woman like you doing in a place like this? Why all the secrecy about your research? You've got some of Yeah... but those, those cockroaches... are they, uh, a normal Have you ever come across, uh, a type of cockroach that, uh, Really. So, you've never seen an instance where a cockroach Nose? What is that supposed to prove? As, uh... as nocturnal insect swarms. That's, uh... that's fascinating. Honest? No. No, actually, I, I find it quite refreshing. I can't sleep. They're conducting legitimate experiments. No. But she did tell me everything else there is to know about Bambi also has this theory I've never come acro... Doctor Berenbaum. Anyway, her theory is... Yeah. Both her parents were naturalists. Her theory is that Scully, can I confess something to you? I hate insects. No, no, I'm not afraid of them. I hate them. One day back when Yeah, I had a praying mantis epiphany and, as a result, I screamed. Oh, I got to go. One of the motel guests died. Scully, I think this man died from simply from a reaction to No, I... I'm saying that I think this mans imply had a heart Maybe not. All your conjectures have proved correct. The exterminator Or the fact that their exoskeletons are made of metal. Whatever. Can you tell what kind of cockroach it is? Is it abnormal? Does it still look unusual? You're implying that this insect is mechanical? He works out of this town? Doctor Ivanov? So this one is just programmed to head towards any object moving Then why is it following me? Your contract is with NASA? I'm just speculating here, but if extraterrestrial lifeforms And assuming that they're more technologically advanced than Can you identify this? Try it under the microscope. Oh, Doctor, I, uh... I appreciate you taking the time to, uh... Greetings from planet Earth. Even the... Mulder. Where are you? Manure? Scully, if an alien civilization were technologically advanced Where's the research facility located? Wait, Bambi. You better wait here until I make sure it's safe. Well, I'm not so much worried about the cockroaches than I am Doctor Eckerle? You're not in any danger, these insects won't harm you. They weren't responsible for those deaths... but they might In Madagascar, they have roaches that hiss by blowing air through I don't. That's why we shouldn't kill these, but capture them No. You've just had a very stressful day that's affected your I assure you, Doctor Eckerle, I'm just as human as you are... Get out, Scully! This whole place could blow! Or anything else, for that matter. Well, they're completely desiccated... just like the molted Well, I've already had a similar sample analyzed, it's nothing You know, I never thought I'd say this to you, Scully... but The development of our cerebral cortex has been the greatest Our blind date's not off to a good start. I've been waiting It's just you, me, and the drug dealers. Especially when Congress is in session. Follow where? What do you mean, that's all you have for me? I get an anonymous Then you're just a messenger boy? Who told you to contact me? How do I know I'm not being played? Well, then you can go ahead and recycle that, then. Multiple homicide, a bizarre one. That's Joseph Patnik. He murdered Well, he claims to have been killing the same man over and over Not that I know, but I only just got this case yesterday. In Patnik's neighborhood two weeks ago, a babysitter attacked Not so far, no. Doctor Stroman, this is my partner, Special Agent Scully. Have you? He seems pretty manageable to me. Who called you down on this case? Could we speak to him? Came from an outside source. I don't know. We've got dead bodies and confessed murderers. If we're being You got a pass to come in here and eat these people's food and Well, maybe you should head back to school. Anything good? Between what he saw and what he recorded and what he did? I just watched thirty-six hours of Bernard Shaw and Bobbie Battista. What's on the tapes? The same guy that started Patnik screaming in the psych ward? So you think that because Patnik saw this war criminal on television, Yeah, but those studies are based on the assumption that Americans They, studies have also shown causal connections between cow How? All I know is television does not make a previously sane man I can't. Not yet. I'm going to get some sleep. Looks like you could use some too. You have fun. Scully? I just got a call. There's been another murder. It happened just less than an hour ago. It seems to match our No. Uh, I went out, and I got a paper this morning. Why? Okay, thanks, Detective. She looked out the window and claims she saw her husband in Yeah, apparently, he was only taking a nap with his dog... This is not even her husband. Her husband's a long-haul trucker. A thing of beauty is a joy forever... what do you think, Scully? As it does in almost every American home, but television does Hang on a second. I'm coming down. I found a cable trapper scrambler running from the pole into Yeah, I'll do it. Stay in touch. What does this one block? Then what does it do? I bet all you guys were officers in the audio-visual club in Looks the same. Still looks the same. So they're different. Yeah, you click it on, you have a picture. What kind of information? Well, can you take it apart? This device is emitting a signal. Mulder. I was just about to call you. I think they may be running some kind of test. Yeah. I didn't take it over to Pendrell. Look, I'd, I'd rather talk about it when we get on the land What was what? Scully, is there something wrong? Scully, look, I'm going to be right there, okay? Don't go anywhere. Here, she's in here. Ready? Wait... Mrs. Scully, hi, it's Fox Mulder. I was hoping that you'd heard from Dana. I'm... I'm not exactly sure. Well, she ran off last night. Um... we, we, we're looking for Look, Mrs. Scully, I hate to do this to you, but I got to hang Hang by the phone. I will call you as soon as I know something. I appreciate that, but these officers should be instructed not Just to keep an eye on her till I can get there. I think I can That's because she's not responsible for her own actions. She's I can't explain the exact mechanism, but it has something to Videotapes that contain an electronic signal that somehow induces I'm working on that. Mulder. What is it? What am I looking at? Bring it home, boys. Mind control? The naked lady in the ice cube. Why wasn't I affected? This, uh... subliminal signal, could color be a factor in it? I'm red-green color blind. Mulder. I'll be right there. Maryland State Police. They think they've found Scully. No, um... they think maybe I should come down and I.D. the body. I can't talk to you right now. That's an interesting choice of words. My partner may be dead. The hell it isn't! We're here because of you! Who are you, who do you work for? Who? Let me do that. She's not answering her phone? Mrs. Scully, is she here? You haven't been answering your phone. I need to see her. Sorry. I'm here to help you, Scully. I'm on your side, you know that. Scully, listen to me very carefully. You don't know it, but Scully, you are the only one I trust. How you feeling? Now you know how I feel most of the time. I'm not surprised. Helen Riddock was scared her husband was going to be unfaithful What do you mean? Ah, maybe not. Well, somebody's behind this, we just don't know who. I don't know. What, uh, course of treatment have you outlined for Agent Scully? That didn't seem to be the case last night. You think that would account for her strange behavior? Doctor Lorenz, uh... Thank you. Yeah, this is Fox Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. You know where I can reach him? Is it 555-0135? Thank you. You want me to go first this time? You charge for local calls? You'd have a record of all calls made... Thanks. Now that you've destroyed all the evidence. I just didn't know I was working for you. Why kill them if you wanted me to expose them? And uncover what? What were they trying to do, manipulate people's Where will they stop? Don't lay this off on me, you sneaky son of a bitch. You pulled You're a coward! You work in the shadows, you feed me scraps Yes, sir. No, sir. He remains an unknown subject.
They're taking abductees.
You're an abductee.
Scully!
Scully!
FBI!
I got I.D. In my back pocket.
Check the I.D.!
Check my I.D. in the back pocket.
Thank you.
Same case you're working on.
Not who, what.
I don't know.
See the claw marks here?
Someone tried to get in.
Deputy?
Deputy, can you describe for me what you saw?
Well, you must have seen something in order to run away from it.
Yeah, maybe, but she's not the only one seeing monsters.
Yeah.
Also, these sightings only occur on nights when there's a.
What you saw was large, right?
Maybe seven, eight feet tall.
Claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door.
And dare I forget teeth.
It bit you, didn't it?
A werewolf.
It's what did that.
It also.
Unfortunately though, Deputy, you've been bitten.
The skin is.
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to be isolated and kept under.
I'm talking about preventing this man from becoming a danger to.
Excuse me.
What is it?
I don't think it's live television, Scully.
She just said bleep.
I'm clear on that, Scully.
This presents an opportunity.
I feel we're very close here.
What career?
Scully, I appreciate it.
You don't.
Okay, fine.
Well, do me a favor.
Will you escort Deputy Wetzel.
Okay.
Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it in detail to the sketch artist.
Look at that.
Excuse me.
Look at this.
It's like five claw.
I'll show you.
This... this is what Hyman Escalara described just.
Ten to one that's what Mrs. Guerrero's going to describe, too.
This is strange.
This is what she was seeing?
Catch him?
How's Deputy Wetzel?
You let him get released?
Oh.
So, what did Skinner say?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, Scully, I'm not entirely.
No, something else.
I'm not sure what.
Some other kind of.
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
That's what I was afraid of, Scully.
Our suspect, apparently.
Slash marks match up pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Nice color.
Hey, uh...
who called 911 on this?
The Steve and Edy?
Did you see anything... that looked like this?
Or this?
Well-well, we should may... we should go.
So, apparently, we're on the lookout for someone whose hair.
I'd have to say that at, uh.
Yeah, which-which in it...
in it... in its own way is a... is a.
Chantara Gomez?
Chantara Gomez.
Chantara Gomez?
Show her your hands.
Fisher and Belmont... that's your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?
All right, look, I believe you.
I think you saw something.
Chantara... if you're afraid that what you tell us we're not going.
Who's Chuco?
I'm s... I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I got that.
Chuco.
He's not our guy.
I don't care how bad his rep is, he can't turn over a squad car.
No, there's something else going on.
Yeah, but how long ago?
Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at.
Excuse me.
Hey, Deputy.
You ready to talk to me now?
You and I both.
Well, describe it for me.
The wasp man?
So you're saying that the, uh, the wasp man attacked you both.
I think maybe it can.
Just... just relax a minute. Excuse me.
We came on this case looking for a werewolf, right?
Hyman Escalara claimed he was attacked by a werewolf and.
And then another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger.
Yeah.
Probably by... by figuring out how it chooses its prey.
Right.
Who?
Well, we're back at the home of Steve and Edy.
Thought we'd.
We're not here to get involved in any kind of personal...
We're not here to get involved in personal problems.
Settle down.
Oh. Uh...
Well, take our word for it.
Because of your proximity to the.
No, no. That's not why.
That's not why.
I think maybe we should stay up for a little while.
Let's just...
Just relax.
How you doing, Edy?
You still upset?
You're scared?
You're not afraid?
Well, I'd say we should station a couple of deputies out here.
For a possible contagion?
Yeah.
No?
All right.
Make it fast.
Fill that tank up with gas.
Uh, Deputy, you're the only person who's seen this twice so I'd.
Thanks.
Yeah, I believe you.
Why do I believe you?
The camera doesn't always tell the whole story.
I don't think she thinks you're lying.
I don't know.
Uh, I guess just do good work.
Tell me about it.
You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died?
Why?
She was afraid.
She was afraid... and her fear killed her in the.
It's the same.
It's the same M.O.
Same as the others.
What.
Yeah, but you weren't afraid.
You weren't afraid for your life.
Neither were Steve.
No, no.
It makes perfect sense.
But I was with him.
I was backing him up.
Wetzel?!
That gun's not going to be any good.
Well, how come they're not in yet?
If you say so.
Where's Wetzel?
Stay where you are.
Look at this, Scully.
Wetzel?
Wetzel?
Wetzel?
Wetzel?!
Wetzel, don't be afraid.
It can't hurt you!
Geez.
Wetzel?
The sun just came up.
Maybe it just went away until the next full moon.
I don't know.
Well, hey, you know, it all depends Robbing a jewelry store is a federal crime. I don't know. I got a call from some guy I used to work with Reggie! Reggie! This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue. You guys turn up anything? Why? Wait, wait a second... What about witness descriptions? Damn it, Reggie, that's Barnett. It was my first case at the bureau. Barnett was doing armed That Barnett had an inside connection. An employee at the armored Yeah, we planted bogus waybills, manifests with the armored Clever, huh? No, we did. We did, but not, uh, not clean. An agent died because He avoided the death penalty on a technicality. But he went No, that's just it. He did die in prison, four years ago. I was paying attention. Yeah, I play golf with him every Sunday. What do you think? You're slipping, Henderson. Yeah... seriously, what do you think? Yeah, does it match Barnett? But you're not sure? Could it have been traced over an old note of Barnett's? Thanks, Henderson, I owe you one. Ninety-five percent sure it's Barnett's handwriting. Federal Bureau of Prisons sent me a copy of his death certificate. The note was written in the last forty-eight hours. No prints. Revenge from the grave? That'd be a neat trick. And he showed you the videotape? Did I? Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids. One of his I'll get you, you son of a bitch! Barnett said he'd get me, you were there. Apparently not. It's Barnett, Reggie. I don't know, I just feel it. And now? I've heard this story. What? Are you saying that somebody from the bureau's behind Killing a sales clerk just to leave me a note? I'd say that's He's older now, he may have put on some weight. Five years. Yes, I felt that he was, uh, daring us to catch him. That he We had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out. Now, we Yes, ma'am. We surrounded Barnett. We ordered him to surrender his hostage I was right behind Barnett. Yes, ma'am. Well, it's against F.B.I. regulations to unnecessarily endanger The suspect, uh, John Barnett, fired his weapon point-blank He gunned him down just for spite. This is a man with a wife and two small children......and you, you shot him without hesitation, without conscience, Which is why you should die like an animal, you son of a bitch! I'll need printouts of every variation. What did they come up with? You knew John Barnett? How well did you know him? Are you aware that Barnett died of cardiac arrest in this facility Why do you say that? Was it Doctor Ridley? I know what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to hang around I didn't know you believe in ghosts, Scully. Mulder. Barnett? Well, you know, shouldn't I be? In some states. What makes you think I'm taping you? What state are you in? I don't think so. How do I know it's really you, Barnett? I don't know, what did you tell me in the courtroom? Listen, by all accounts, John Barnett is a dead man. Fine. I just need confirmation that you are who you say you Barnett? You there? Yeah, he was hip to the trace. John Barnett was from New Hampshire. He had a slight accent. I don't know, but that is... John Barnett. I'm sure of it. Reggie, it's Mulder. IT'S ONLY 10.
45, old man. Listen, Reggie, it doesn't look like Barnett's dead after all. I got an inmate at the prison who swears he saw Barnett alive No, listen, Reggie, there's just one thing that doesn't make That Agent Henderson said that that note that was left at the Well, this inmate at the prison swears he saw Barnett's right His wife died of cancer six years ago. Never liked to talk about I'm just thinking how different things would've been if I would've Would you be able to tell if this note was written by somebody So you think it's the same person that wrote the first note. Yeah. What do you mean? Where does it say that? What kind of research? She looks about ninety. What's the cause of death? Is that Doctor Ridley? Why wasn't he allowed to? What? Ridley's found a way. He wanted human research subjects, right? Prisoners. Prisoners Well, what would you have said twenty years ago about gene splicing, I want to age him backwards now. Let's start with ten years. If you're really Doctor Joseph Ridley, where've you been for What about Barnett? What about you? And what about Barnett? Barnett's not dying. You were able to grow John Barnett a new hand? Until John Barnett. They financed your research? I wish Agent Perdue were around to appreciate the irony. Yes, Ridley was... What does he want? Will he get it? You're aware that this... freak of science you're negotiating I will. What's that? What do you mean? Scully... Mulder. The rest of my friends? You're not that smart. Well, you won't get that chance. What does Barnett know about your phone messages? Where's that? Before the performance and during, we're working at a disadvantage We know that if he shows, he'll be keying on Scully. So wherever Let's make sure it's not the last time. Down! Back off, back off... Just let her go. Shut up! Call an ambulance! How you feeling? That bullet went through eight layers of kevlar, you're lucky Well, they flew in three specialists to try to save his life. Yeah, but he's not talking. Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it? Bastard will take that research with him to the grave. Who knows? If Barnett didn't destroy it, he could have stashed And when they do... maybe he can get his revenge from beyond Oh, you are home. I was trying to reach you. I think your phone's off the hook.
Is that why you're taking the I want some answers. The unexplained death of a postal worker that somebody From his partner. After he finished questioning me about the detective's death. He was killed, shot in the head execution-style. His body Well, I'd like your help on this, sir. Agent Scully is in the hospital. She's undergoing some imaging tests. Her, uh, her.
Want me to, uh, dump this. All right.
Her body's gone, sir. The postal worker in the photos that I gave you. Her I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm playing catch-up here, and I'm I had them run a test. The blood sample in the police No, but I do have a place to start. The gun that killed Sir? I will. Sir? You looking for me? First Nations Bank of Virginia. The bank is adjacent to the police headquarters where I'm gonna hand deliver it to Special Photo right now. Thanks for getting down here so quickly. A break. Maybe even a lead. I wanted you to get a look at this body before somebody Smallpox. The first reported case in over seven years. According to the coroner, an especially virulent strain From these. Bee stingers and venom sacs recovered subcutaneously He was a forensic entomologist. I consulted with him Yeah, but I've never had any hard evidence. Not until now. I can only guess.
