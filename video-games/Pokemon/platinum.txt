Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! Are you catching Pokémon? 
Wow! You’ve already got [VAR(306, 0, 0)] Pokémon with you! At that pace, your Pokédex should be full in no time at all! 
...Um... I think you’d feel a lot safer if you were to catch some more. You know, like when you need to travel to faraway places. 
Oh, I know! Don’t you think it’s better to know more about Pokémon? Sure it is! I know just the place. Come on! Don’t be shy. Follow me! 
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! How many Pokémon have you caught? 
Whoa! You already have [VAR(306, 0, 0)] Pokémon with you! 
Huh? I think you should catch some more. It might be more of a challenge raising a lot of Pokémon... But it’s worth it. The more Pokémon you have, the happier you’ll be. 
Hey, that’s right! Don’t you think it’s better to know more about Pokémon? Sure it is! There’s this great place for that. Come on! It’s all right. Follow me. 
Dawn: That man... What is he doing? 
Dawn: Um...
Lucas: That guy... What’s he doing? 
Lucas: Uh, excuse...
WHAAAT?! 
Mysterious man: ...How did you know? How did you unmask me as a member of the International Police?! 
Dawn: Huh? What? I beg your pardon? I was just making conversation... 
Lucas: Huh? What? Are you kidding? I was just making small talk... 
Shady man: ...Heh. You claim you were only making conversation, do you? But, I know better not to believe that. No, no, no. You recognized right away that I was someone extraordinary. That is why you spoke to me, is it not? Your power of observation is fearsome! Quite admirable, you are! 
Now that my cover has been blown, let me introduce myself. I am a globe-trotting elite of the International Police. My name... Ah, no, I shall inform you only of my code name. My code name, it is Looker. It is what they all call me. Incidentally, is the saying, “Don’t be a thief!” familiar to you?
Looker: Yes, that is correct. Taking what belongs to others is wrong. 
Looker: No? You claim to not know it? How could that be? Perhaps your mama has said it, but you have forgotten it, like usual? Now listen, my friends. It is wrong to take what belongs to others. 
Unfortunately, there are apparently those who do not heed those words. In Sinnoh, in fact, there are criminals stealing the Pokémon of others. I have, therefore, been on the lookout for characters arousing my suspicion. Incidentally, you are Trainers, yes? Perhaps you can make use of this? 
That Vs. Recorder, it is a nifty device for recording a match. I obtained it because it is quite popular these days. But myself, I do not do Pokémon battling very often. It will be in better hands with you. 
Looker: Also, I have a request. If you were to see me again, I ask that you not talk to me, for I am on duty. ...Actually, yes, yes, you may speak to me. You must. Not because I am lonely, no, no! You must inform me of bad guys! You must inform me of any happenings! 
Dawn: ...Working for the International Police must be hard. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], here it is. It’s the Trainers’ School. The name says it all! 
I saw your friend [VAR(259, 1, 0)] go in earlier. He could still be in there studying. OK, bye now! 
Lucas: ...Working for the International Police sounds hard. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], here we are. This is the Trainers’ School. The name says it all! 
Your pal [VAR(259, 1, 0)] went in earlier. He might still be studying in there. OK, see you around! 
Jubilife City’s built on land they carved out of a mountain. The people and Pokémon of Oreburgh City helped out with that undertaking.
Hello! Let me ask you, have you paid a visit to the TV station? If you’ve never been, you owe it to yourself to make the trip. And, if you’ve been there before, it never hurts to visit again. After all, you can be a star! Or at least dream of being one!
Ah, it is you! Have no fear. There are no shady characters about. Incidentally, have you visited the Trainers’ School? Did your friend not guide you there earlier?
Looker: Hello, my friend. Have you visited the Trainers’ School? Did your friend not guide you there earlier? 
Ah, it is you! Have no fear. There are no shady characters about. Incidentally, have you not obtained a Pokétch? I believe a Pokétch is now free in exchange for some Coupons?
Looker: Tell me, have you not obtained a Pokétch? I believe a Pokétch is now free in exchange for some Coupons? 
Ah, it is you! Have no fear. There are no shady characters about. Incidentally, have you not obtained a Gym Badge? I believe you receive one for defeating the Gym Leader at a Pokémon Gym?
Looker: Tell me, have you not obtained a Pal Pad? Is not a Pal Pad free to anyone visiting the Pokémon Center’s basement? 
Ah, yes. I see that you have obtained it, a Pal Pad for yourself. I myself, a member of the International Police, the fighters of crime around the world, have one also. For it is what one must have to trade Pokémon with Trainers around the world. Take that Pal Pad to the Global Terminal for trading on an international level! 
Anyway, there appears to be no one shady in this Jubilife City. I shall therefore take my investigation elsewhere. But, my friend, I suggest you remain vigilant for shady grown-ups! 
Oh, oh, oh? You call yourself a Pokémon Trainer? And yet you have no Pokétch? That is, Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch for short! Oh my, you are a rare case indeed! 
You see, I invented, and now manufacture, Pokétches. Not only that, I’m now conducting the Pokétch promotional campaign! All you have to do is find three clowns in Jubilife City. If you can find them... I will gift you with a Pokétch!
The three clowns will each ask you a skill-testing question. The questions will all have to do with Pokémon. After all, a Pokétch is a tool for Pokémon Trainers. Collect a Coupon from each clown, then come see me, OK?
OK, let me count your Coupons! I’ll use the Pokétch here... One, two, three! Bravo! I say, bravo! In return for these Coupons, I present you this Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch for short! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received a [VAR(65280, 1)]Pokétch[VAR(65280, 0)]![VAR(512, 1)]
You can add apps to your Pokétch to make it even more versatile! Touch the Pokétch screen and find the apps that are right for you! 
Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown! Let’s roll out my question! Does a Pokémon grow by defeating others and gaining Exp. Points?
Ding-ding! You’re absolutely correct! 
Bzzzzt! That’s the wrong answer...
Pokémon grow stronger by defeating other Pokémon in battle. Some Pokémon even grow into an entirely different form in a process known as evolution. 
Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon! 
Pokémon grow stronger through battling. Some Pokémon even grow into an entirely different form in a process known as evolution.
Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown! Let’s roll out my question! Just like Pokémon types, the moves of Pokémon also have types?
Ding-ding! You’re absolutely correct! 
Bzzzzt! That’s the wrong answer...
If the Pokémon’s type matches its move’s type, that move is made much more powerful! 
Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon!

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown! Let’s roll out my question! Can a Pokémon hold an item?
Ding-ding! You’re absolutely correct! 
Bzzzzt! That’s the wrong answer...
A Pokémon may hold a single item. Some items become effective as soon as they are held by a Pokémon. Berries are eaten by Pokémon as necessary during battle. 
Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon! 
Hi, there. You should stick around. We’re doing a Pokétch campaign soon. Before it starts, I think you should brush up at the Trainers’ School.
A Pokémon may hold a single item. Some items become effective as soon as they are held by Pokémon. Berries are eaten by Pokémon as necessary during battle.
Mystery man: Now, now, now, now, now! Professor Rowan, you must comply. Hand over all your research findings. For free, naturally. Failure to comply will result in a painful time for your assistant. 
Rowan: Ah, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Well? How is the Pokédex progressing? Hm! That’s Oreburgh’s Gym Badge, I see. But hadn’t I given you your first Pokémon only recently...? Perhaps being a Trainer is like second nature to you. 
Mystery man: Oh, professor of Pokémon, must you be so difficult? We are speaking to you on business. Because this is work for us. What we’re saying is--we demand you comply with our demands. 
Rowan: Quiet, you lot! Why must you be such a nuisance? Let me list some lessons you still need to learn. #1: Don’t loiter about for no good reason. #2: Don’t interrupt others while they are attempting to converse. #3: If you don’t get your way, don’t raise your voice to be intimidating. #4: Don’t think you’ve grown strong just because you’re in a group. #5: What is with those outlandish outfits you have on? 
My goodness... You call yourselves adults? You kids, don’t grow up to be like these sorry specimens. 
Mystery man: Eeeeeh! You had to make this personal! You have forced our hand into making a show of force! We will make you regret insulting Team Galactic! 
Rowan: You kids, give these thugs a lesson in civility, please. 
Dawn: [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! Let’s battle together! 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! Join me and battle these guys! 
Grunt 1: You leave us no option. We will retreat for now. We shall do so because Team Galactic is benevolent to all. 
Rowan: That lot... They called themselves Team Galactic. When Pokémon evolve, they seem to release some type of energy... However, I believe that it’s a mystic power far beyond our control. But Team Galactic seems to be studying that power’s potential. They want to know if it can be used as energy for something... 
Dawn: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], did you know? The professor studies the evolution of Pokémon, too. According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon are somehow tied to evolution! Well, maybe that’s the reason those people tried to take the professor’s research data by force. That’s really unforgivable! 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], did you know about this? The professor studies the evolution of Pokémon, too. According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon are somehow tied to evolution! Maybe that’s the reason those goons tried to take the professor’s research data. They’re not allowed to do that! 
Rowan: It’s all over, so you can  relax now. Still, thanks to you two, nothing came of that situation. I appreciate that. Incidentally, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Kudos to you for your battling skill. It got me thinking. Why don’t you collect all the Gym Badges of Sinnoh? Doing so, you will be sure to encounter lots of Pokémon. That, of course, means your Pokédex pages will continuously fill up. In other words, it will be of great help to my research. That said, I’ve given you your first Pokémon and Pokédex as yours to keep. You’re free to do with them as you wish. Take care now. 
Oh, that was very good! Nicely done! Truly excellent! Oh, I beg your pardon, I’m from Jubilife TV! I’d like you to have something for letting me see that smashing battle! 
Contained within that Fashion Case... You will find a whole spectrum of chic Accessories and tasteful Backdrops! Dress up your Pokémon and watch their appeal grow! And, right now the TV station is offering its facilities so visitors can dress up their Pokémon! There are also prize giveaways, too! Please do visit our TV station! 
The way you look... You’re obviously a Trainer! Can you tell me what type of Pokémon you like?
The Fire type? You must have a fiery personality. You’d better watch out that fire isn’t doused by water, though.
A person that likes the Water type must be somewhat cool. But beware of being drained dry by thirsty grass.
You chose the Grass type? No wonder you look so calm. I think you need to watch out you don’t get burned by fire.
Did you see me on TV? I was in an interview!
When you walk with your Pokémon, they gradually grow friendlier.
OK, set six Poké Balls in my belt... Yeah, that’ll do it. At most, you can have six Pokémon with you.
Hiya, where’d you come from? ... Twinleaf Town, huh... It’s a nice place. Quiet and all. Jubilife City is a big place, so it might be a bit of a shock to you.
Hello, Trainer! Do you know much about Pokémon?
Ah, I see! You are knowledgeable! I imagine you wouldn’t see the need to visit the Trainers’ School, then. But do visit if you have the time. You may discover something new!
Oh, you’re not knowledgeable... But not to worry! There’s the Trainers’ School. The school will teach you the basics of Pokémon.
Past here is the Global Terminal, your gateway to the world! Oh, I’m sorry, you don’t have any Gym Badges. The Global Terminal is off-limits if you don’t have a Gym Badge. Sorry! 
Past here is the Global Terminal. It lets you trade with the whole world! Trading Pokémon means connecting with friends, both old and new. That’s awesome!
I’m trading Pokémon with my buddy!
I made my Pokémon hold an item before trading it. That will make the other Trainer double happy!

Aww, man. I wasted money on some Poké Balls. I should’ve lowered the HP of wild Pokémon more before throwing them.
The one thing you must remember is to pack some Potions. If all your Pokémon faint, it’ll be lights out for you, too!
Potions are important, but sometimes, it’s better to simply avoid battles. If you want to avoid wild Pokémon for a while, just use a Repel. After all, if you don’t battle, your Pokémon can’t lose HP.

You know how Pokémon have types like Water, Fire, and Grass? Well, all types have strengths and weaknesses against other types.
In the Union Room upstairs, you can chat and trade with other people. And that’s not all you can do. Check it out!
You can still catch a Pokémon if you already have six traveling with you. It automatically gets sent to the PC network in Pokémon Centers. Knowing that, I can keep on catching more and more Pokémon! It’ll make it more fun to check the PC in any Pokémon Center!
Hi, can we feature you in a news piece we’re doing? All you have to do is battle with me. Will you do that?
Reporter Kinsey’s live interview! 
Unbelievable! Press coverage denied! I find you intriguing, too...
To get people to open up, we approach them honestly with no hidden tricks. It’s like the relationship between Pokémon and Trainers, isn’t it?
I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! Is it OK to go for the scoop?
As a professional cameraman, I always go for the best shot! 
That’s a downer... I thought I’d found a Trainer and Pokémon who’d shine on camera.
The lively expressions on you and your Pokémon’s faces... It sure makes for some great TV!
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am! Aren’t you having fun?! Let’s make it fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this? Shall we do something fantastical? 
Oh, how shall I say this...? It makes me all lonely, I say...
A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while laughing. Mwahahah! It defines what we do!

Hi, hi! I’m the president of the Pokétch Company! 
I’m developing a new Pokétch app, but it’s not quite done. My guess is that it will be ready when you get a Gym Badge.
Hi, hi! Your patience is rewarded! I’ve developed a new Pokétch app! 
That’s the Memo Pad! It’s... Well, it is what it is!
I’m developing a new Pokétch app, but it’s not quite done. My guess is that it will be ready when you get three Gym Badges.
Hi, hi! Your patience is rewarded! I’ve developed another new Pokétch app! 
Having a map constantly displayed is convenient, no? You can also mark things, so it’s that much more useful.
I’m developing a new Pokétch app, but it’s not quite done. My guess is that it will be ready when you get five Gym Badges.
Hi, hi! Your patience is rewarded! I’ve developed yet another new Pokétch app! 
I think it will be useful to know how many people are communicating, like in the Union Room.
I’m developing a new Pokétch app, but it’s not quite done. My guess is that it will be ready when you get seven Gym Badges.
Hi, hi! Your patience is rewarded! I’ve developed still yet another new Pokétch app! 
Check type matchups so you can make all your attacks super effective! You’ll become stronger than ever!
Yup, all sorts of people will give you Pokétch apps. Everyone gets super happy that way!
So, yup, what to do? Do you think I should solicit new Pokétch ideas?
Oh, you can be sure I will keep developing Pokétch apps. Just like Pokémon, my Pokétch is something that evolves!
Welcome to the Pokétch Company. We’re actually a family-run business, so we’re not very impressive.
Hey, do you watch TV? “Pokétch Detective” is a great show. Seeing that program compels me to use my Pokétch more!

We’ll try to think like a Trainer and find what Pokétch apps would be good.
Pokémon Watch! That’s Pokétch for short. Say it the long way and... What does Pokémon stand for again? Anyway, I’m the father of the president of the Pokétch Company!

My husband’s the president. We started out in a small workshop where he made what he liked. Now we’re making something that makes the world happy. Imagine that!
People everywhere make Pokétch apps. You’ll be able to get new apps from surprising sources. The PCs here have guides on the various Pokétch apps.

The Digital Watch displays the current time. Don’t be late for meetings with your friends! 
The Analog Watch displays the current time. The short hand indicates the hour, and the long hand shows the minute! 
The Alarm Clock can be set to sound every 24 hours. Set the alarm time with the lower button. The top button turns it on. 
The Stopwatch is used for measuring time precisely. How quickly can you zip through the Cycling Road? 
The Kitchen Timer can count down from up to 99 minutes, but not precisely. Set the time with the center button, then start the countdown. 
Use the monthly Calendar to make a note of important dates. Touch any date to change its color. Touch it again to turn it back. 
The Calculator can handle up to ten digits. It’s perfect for figuring out math questions that might pop up. 
The Pokémon List indicates the statuses of your team’s Pokémon. Touch them to hear their cries. Their HP bar is also displayed. 
The Friendship Checker indicates how friendly your Pokémon are to you. Touch the screen. The Pokémon that like you will come closer. 
The Day-Care Checker shows the Pokémon you have in the Day Care. Check and see how your Pokémon are doing with the Day-Care Couple. 
The Matchup Checker tests the attraction between Pokémon. The greater the number of hearts, the better likelihood of Eggs. 
The Pokémon History keeps track of the Pokémon you have obtained. It shows the last twelve kinds of Pokémon you obtained.

I’m going to get commercials shown on TV. They’ll attract more customers to the department store.
The TV station interviews all sorts of Trainers for its shows. After all, people want to know about good Trainers and what they say. Personally, I’d like to learn more about Gym Leaders. I’d also like to hear about the tough Elite Four of the Pokémon League.

Oh, yeah? That’s interesting. Thanks for answering my questions. I’ll file it away for reference. Keep your channel tuned to Jubilife TV!
Oh, all right. I can understand how busy it must get for you. It’d be cool if you could answer my questions when you’ve got time. See you again!

You have a Fashion Case, don’t you? Ah, oui, wonderful! Just choose the Accessories and put them on your Pokémon. When you’re done, I will snap a photo and put it up beside me! If you mix your records with others, you can get their photos, too! I think it will be much easier if  you will just try!

Pokémon are wonderful, deeply mysterious creatures. But to Trainers, the key thing is to do battle with their Pokémon. That’s what it boils down to.

Oh, your Pokémon is quite adorable! Here, try making it hold this [VAR(264, 0, 0)]. 
A Pokémon holding that Quick Claw can sometimes attack first, even if it is normally a little bit slow. There are other items that are only useful when given to a Pokémon. Try finding other items that you can make your Pokémon hold. ...I sound like I’m a teacher or something.

I like how Pokémon can use attacks. That makes things fun and different. Sometimes, when they get stronger, Pokémon learn new moves. That keeps things fresh and fun when using moves.
Did you buy some Heal Balls at the Poké Mart? A Heal Ball completely heals the Pokémon it captures on the spot. That means you can catch a Pokémon and have it battle-ready right away. Of course, if your team has six Pokémon in it, it won’t do any good.

Welcome! This is the Global Trade Station, or GTS for short. We enable the trading of Pokémon with people worldwide over Nintendo WFC. Would you like to do a global Pokémon trade?
Hello! Welcome to the GTS! Would you like to do a global Pokémon trade over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection?
You may trade Pokémon one of two ways at the GTS. You may offer a Pokémon for trade, or search among offered Pokémon. Should I describe things in greater detail?
You will be asked to put up the Pokémon you are offering to trade. At that time, you will be asked what Pokémon you would like in return. If another player offers your desired Pokémon in return for your offered Pokémon, the trade will go through. Should I explain anything else?
You may search among the Pokémon that are offered by other Trainers. They will all identify what Pokémon their Trainers want back in return. If you find one that you want, you must provide us with the kind of Pokémon wanted in return. Should I explain anything else?
Would you like to make a global Pokémon trade?
Please do visit again.
I hope you enjoy your visit to the GTS! 
...Uh-oh! I’m sorry, but your team and all your PC Boxes are full. If you wish to use the GTS, you must have room on your team or in a PC Box.
...Uh-oh! You only have one Pokémon with you. If you wish to use the GTS, you must have at least two Pokémon with you. Please come back with more Pokémon on your team.
That’s a big globe, eh? Where do I live on it now? Let’s see if I can point it out...
They say if you communicate with someone, their location is recorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon here to trade. Who knows, it might be traded while I’m asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with Pokémon fans around the world. Isn’t that something?
You can register where you live on this giant globe. Once you do, you can show your location to anyone you communicate with.
Is Nintendo WFC something even I can use easily? If it is really that easy, I’d love to trade Pokémon, too!
This week, I’ll do it! I really want to make the Top 8 of the rankings.
The Global Terminal has three floors. You use warp panels for getting from one floor to another. A blue panel takes you to the GTS on the ground floor. Take a green panel to the studios for Box Data and Dress-Up Data on 2F. Take a pink warp panel to the third floor for the Battle Video Gallery.

I visit every day to check on other people’s Dress-Up Data. For me, it’s like the first step to fashion!
Oh, dear me! Gracious! This is almost scandalous!
The combination of that Pokémon with those Accessories... It was so stunningly wonderful, I feel as if I’ve been zapped!

After all, it’s the Trainer’s job to avoid having their precious Pokémon hurt in battle, right? So, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], what brings you? Huh? You’ve got something for me? 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] delivered the Parcel.
[VAR(259, 1, 0)]: So, what is this...? Score! It’s a Town Map! Huh?! Why are there two in here? I like it a lot, but I don’t need two. Here, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you take one! 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)]: Hmm... Well, according to the Town Map, I guess Oreburgh City is where I should be going next. There’s a Gym, so it’d be perfect for raising the Pokémon I just caught. Well, I’m on the road to becoming the greatest Trainer of all time! See you around! 
It’s perfectly fine for Trainers and Pokémon to develop at their own pace. If there is anything you’re not familiar with, you can look it up here.
                             
We learned about Pokémon types today. Umm... Grass is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to Water, and Water is weak to Grass!
Pokémon are smart enough to use items they’re holding. But they won’t know what to do with man-made items like Potions and Antidotes.
I wrote an essay in my notebook on  what makes a true Pokémon Trainer.
Doing it is the best way to learn! Can we get a battle with you?
Go! My Pokémon, go! 
Aww! But battling is the best way to learn about Pokémon!
It’s hard to win if you don’t have some Pokémon to choose from.
Whew! You’re really good! We’ve been studying every day, but we were no match for you at all! You’d be able to use this Potion properly. Here you go! 
When a Potion is used, it restores the HP, the health, of a Pokémon. Being a good Trainer isn’t only about ordering your Pokémon around. A superior Trainer knows how to use items to the full advantage!
I just became friends with my Pokémon. I’m not sure if we can do this properly, but may we battle?
I need to try the things I learned before I forget them! 
Boo! Where’s your sense of adventure? Don’t be shy about talking to people and getting into battles!
I wonder if we could have done better against you? Like if I used Potions right when we needed to.
We were actually confident that we would do pretty good. But I’m completely impressed by how tough you are. If you’d like, talk to my friend and get a nice item from him.
The blackboard lists status changes that may affect Pokémon in battle. 
Which would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP. The effects of poison remain after a battle. A poisoned Pokémon’s HP will drop while it is traveling. Heal a poisoning using an Antidote. 
If a Pokémon becomes paralyzed, its Speed stat drops. In addition, it may not be able to move while it is in battle. Paralysis remains after battle. Cure it using a Parlyz Heal. 
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if a battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. Wake it up using an Awakening. 
A burn reduces the Attack stat and steadily reduces the victim’s HP. A burn lingers after battle. Cure a burn using a Burn Heal. 
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless. The Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if a battle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal. 
It’s a notebook filled with writing. Let’s see... Pokémon are to be caught using Poké Balls. Up to six Pokémon can accompany a Trainer. A Trainer is someone who catches Pokémon, raises them, and battles with them. A Trainer’s mission is to defeat the strong Trainers who await challengers in Pokémon Gyms.

The tremor earlier was no quake. It seems it was a mysterious explosion!
Welcome to Canalave City, the Canal City! In the old days, this port used to be a hub of cargo transportation.
What was that tremor? I thought Mt. Coronet erupted!
There’s a really impatient-looking boy hanging out in front of the library. He’s so jittery, just seeing him makes me feel twitchy.

A Poké Ball that makes it easy to catch the same kinds of Pokémon... Well, that’s the Repeat Ball!
I should take a Revive out to everyone training on Iron Island. I’m sure they’d appreciate it. It can be rough out there, especially since there’s no Pokémon Center.

Ah! That’s Oreburgh’s Gym Badge! I see, I see! You’ve defeated my son. But that’s no surprise. He still has much to learn. In place of my son Roark, I, Byron, will take your challenge! 
You were strong enough to take down my prized team of Pokémon. In recognition of that power, I give you this: the Mine Badge! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Mine Badge from Byron!
Having the Mine Badge enables you to use the hidden move Strength anytime outside of battle. And you now have six Gym Badges. That means all Pokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you without question. Here! Take this, too! 
That [VAR(264, 0, 0)] contains the move [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. If it hits, it may also lower the target’s Special Defense.
Gwahahahaha! The Sinnoh region is vast! Tough Trainers like you and [VAR(259, 1, 0)] crop up constantly to challenge the old guard! With more young Trainers like my son and you two taking charge, the future of Pokémon is bright! But I’m not stepping aside just yet! I merely need to rededicate myself to training on Iron Island.
Hey, there! Champ-to-be! The Gym Leader here uses Steel-type Pokémon. Steel-type Pokémon have high Defense, so you’d have to hit them hard!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve beaten the Gym Leader! Good going! That makes it six Gym Badges! I tell you what, you’re really turning into one fine Trainer. If you were to say you’re going to try to become the Pokémon Champ... No one’d laugh at you now! I’m in your corner, kiddo!

It’s easy to get to Iron Island. It’s one boat trip from here.
I was lucky enough to get a Strength HM from Iron Island. But I can’t use it for moving boulders until I beat Byron, the Gym Leader. I should make a note of that on the Pokétch app Memo Pad.
It’s possible for one kind of Pokémon to have different abilities. That’s news to me!
I heard this cool rumor. If you can get on Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can go to the Wi-Fi Plaza. The access to the Wi-Fi Plaza is through the basement of any Pokémon Center.
Come on, let’s show off our Pokémon! Let’s do battle, kiddo!

H-hello! This is the Canalave Library. Please keep quiet while you’re on the premises. It certainly wasn’t me who screamed, [VAR(65281, 200)]“Gyaaah!!”[VAR(65281, 100)] [VAR(65281, 200)][VAR(65281, 100)]or shouted, [VAR(65281, 200)]“Help meee!!”[VAR(65281, 100)] [VAR(65281, 200)][VAR(65281, 100)]No, really, that wasn’t me screaming!

I’ve been asking people not to disturb me while I’m reading... I shouldn’t even have bothered... I’m all agitated now!
The ceiling-high bookshelves are crammed with books.
The shelves are lined with books worn from being read by many people.
Lucian: ...Ah, hello. You’re here to read, too? Books are wonderful things. The thoughts of people written in books stretch beyond time and space. 
I imagine we’ll see each other again at the Pokémon League. Take care. 
I was just reading a collection of letters written by an artist long ago. More precisely, they were written to the artist’s younger brother. “The stars above tantalize from across infinite space. “Feeling their gaze from so far away, I am charmed again by life.” The artist must have come to a conclusion seeing the night sky... It’s an affirmation of life. It’s very moving. 
I was just reading an analytical tome on humankind. It examines the human species from cultural and social perspectives. This is a thought-provoking quote:  “It all began without humans. The end will also be without humans.” The world we share with Pokémon... Does it exist for us? 
I was just reading a collection of observations on Pokémon in the wild. One article addresses the question why Pokémon would go into a Poké Ball. According to the article, this behavior is based on instinct. A weakened Pokémon will curl up tight in an effort to heal itself. The Poké Ball was invented to take advantage of that protective instinct. 
I was just reading a collection of essays on the science-fiction genre. There was one quote attributed to a novelist I found remarkable. “Though love may lose, kindness wins.” I find that philosophical and, at the same time, compassionate. 
I was just reading a book of philosophy from an ancient, far-off land. Their “universe” was a word that described both space and time. That people even back then understood the basic tenets of the universe... It fills me with a serene sense of inspiration.

That tremor... It was wicked! I scrambled to find the book “Disaster Strikes Survival Guide!”
The ceiling-high bookshelves are crammed with books.

Please refrain from bringing food or beverages into the library.
Well, hello! We meet again! After we parted, I went from Oreburgh to Hearthome, Celestic, then Eterna. Yes, the town and cities surrounding the foot of Mt. Coronet. Why my fascination with Mt. Coronet, you may ask? Well, Mt. Coronet happens to be called “The origin of Sinnoh.” I learned many things on my journey. Would you like to hear about them?
Whoa, now let’s not be hasty! I really want to share this with you!
The way I see it, our world began when the spirit within people was born. When that spirit came to be, there followed awareness about the world. Within that newborn spirit, time and space were intertwined as one. People and Pokémon, too, were but the same presence. As I understand it, people and Pokémon shared the spirit and awareness. They should have understood and accepted each other then. 
Because they shared the same spirit, people and Pokémon intermingled. People took the place of Pokémon, and the opposite also held true. That interpretation could give us an idea about how our world came to be. A Pokémon is said to have shaped this world... Could that Pokémon be the physical form of the original spirit? Hmm... The spirit came to be, and from it, time and space were born... That seems to point to legendary DIALGA, the Pokémon of time, and PALKIA, the Pokémon of space... And they lead back to ARCEUS, the Pokémon that made them arise. Isn’t this interesting? Would you like to hear some more?
Whoa, please don’t tease me! I really want to share this with you!
Oh, there were also Plates, weren’t there? One Plate read, “Three beings were born to bind time and space.” Those three beings I read to mean the three Pokémon of the lakes. It’s about UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF. The myth describes how they gave spirit to the world, shaping it. But it all starts with ARCEUS, the first. It is known as the Original One. 
Oh, by the way, I wrote down the words engraved on those Plates. I summarized them in a book and donated it to this library. There it is in that bookshelf. I’d be pleased if you’d read it. 
I have to say I’m glad I came out to Sinnoh. I suppose I’d better be off in search of new myths in faraway lands. It would be nice if our paths were to cross again. 
”Sinnoh’s Beginning as Told on Plates.” This is a collection of engravings from ancient Plates found in Sinnoh. “The Original One breathed alone before the universe came.” “When the universe was created, its shards became this Plate.” “The power of defeated giants infuses this Plate.” “Two beings of time and space set free from the Original One.” “Three beings were born to bind time and space.” “Two make matter, and three make spirit, shaping the world.” “The powers of Plates are shared among Pokémon.” “The rightful bearer of a Plate draws from the Plate it holds.” [VAR(259, 0, 0)] returned the book to its place.

But the more I study, the more mysteries appear and multiply. Pokémon that evolve, and those that don’t... What makes them different from each other? Do those that are immature as living beings evolve to ones more mature? If so, what do we make of the legendary Pokémon that don’t evolve? Are we to assume that the legendary Pokémon are complete as creatures? 
This is where you three come in. In the three lakes of Sinnoh, there are said to be mirage Pokémon. If we can obtain data on them, it may shed some light on how the process of Pokémon evolution works. I need help from each one of you on this grand undertaking.

“Sinnoh Region’s Mythology” Long ago, when Sinnoh had just been made, Pokémon and humans led separate lives. That is not to say they did not help each other. No, indeed they did. They supplied each other with goods, and supported each other. A Pokémon proposed to the others to always be ready to help humans. It asked that Pokémon be ready to appear before humans always. Thus, to this day, Pokémon appear to us if we venture into tall grass.

The young man, seeking the missing Pokémon, journeyed afar. Long did he search. And far and wide, too, until one he did find. Asked he, “Why do you hide?” To which the Pokémon replied... “If you bear your sword to bring harm upon us, with claws and fangs, we will exact a toll. “From your kind we will take our toll, for it must be done. “Done it must be to guard ourselves and for it, I apologize.” ...Would you like to keep reading?
To the skies, the young man shouted his dismay. “In having found the sword, I have lost so much. “Gorged with power, I grew blind to Pokémon being alive. “I will never fall savage again. This sword I denounce and forsake. “I plead for forgiveness, for I was but a fool.” So saying, the young man hurled the sword to the ground, snapping it.

“Sinnoh Folk Story 2” There lived a Pokémon in a forest. In the forest, the Pokémon shed its hide to sleep as a human. Awakened, the human dons the Pokémon hide to roam villages.
“Sinnoh Folk Story 3” There once were Pokémon that became very close to humans. There once were humans and Pokémon that ate together at the same table. It was a time when there existed no differences to distinguish the two.

Welcome! This is the Oreburgh Pokémon Gym! I’m Roark, the Gym Leader! I’m but one Trainer who decided to walk proudly with Rock-type Pokémon! As the Gym Leader, I need to see your potential as a Trainer. And, I’ll need to see the toughness of the Pokémon that battle with you! 
This is embarrassing... I went and lost to a Trainer who didn’t have a single Gym Badge... But that’s tough. You were strong, and I was weak. That’s all there is. According to Pokémon League rules, I have to give you our Gym Badge since you’ve beaten me, the Leader. Here’s your official Pokémon League Coal Badge. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Coal Badge from Roark!
Having that Coal Badge means your Pokémon can now use the hidden move Rock Smash outside of battle. You should also take this, too. 
That [VAR(264, 0, 0)] contains the move Stealth Rock. It’s a move that inflicts damage on foes that switch into battle. Incidentally, a TM will teach its move to a Pokémon instantly. But a TM will break when you use it, so make certain you want a Pokémon to learn that move.
In this region of Sinnoh, there are seven other Gym Leaders. I should warn you--they’re a lot tougher than I am!
Howdy! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? That’s what I said to a really impatient boy earlier, too. The Gym Leader is a user of Rock-type Pokémon. Well, listen. Rock-type Pokémon really hate water, all right? They’re also weak to Grass-type moves. Gee, they sure have weaknesses! But don’t think it will be easy. You don’t get to be a Gym Leader without covering for weaknesses. Going after a Rock-type Pokémon with a Fire-type Pokémon won’t be easy, either. That’s all the advice I can give. Thanks for listening!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve taken care of the Gym Leader! So, did my advice come in handy or what? If my advice was useful, it’d be great if you’d become my fan!

Listen, listen. Do you have a Pokémon called MACHOP? Would you be willing to trade your MACHOP for my ABRA?
Be nice to my ABRA! I’ll be sure to look after your MACHOP in return!
What I asked for was a MACHOP...
Oh, OK... Well, I can’t make you trade me. But if you change your mind, I’ll be right here waiting!
Thanks to Pokémon, I got to be friends with you!
A Pokémon obtained in a trade grows quickly. But if a Pokémon grows too much, it may ignore the Trainer. Of course, it won’t matter if you have lots of Gym Badges.
When you trade a Pokémon, the item it’s holding is traded as well. That’s pretty cool, huh? It means you can send an item as a gift along with your Pokémon in a trade!

All Pokémon have a special power called an ability.
My favorite Pokémon ability is my PACHIRISU’s Pickup. My darling picks up a lot of dropped items without me noticing!
The view is good from the second floor, but it’s a pain going outside. If you don’t mind, how about showing me a Pokémon called GEODUDE?

Hello! Welcome to the Oreburgh Mining Museum!
Hello, hello! How are you? I study Pokémon Fossils! Me! Right here and now! 
You have a Fossil for me, yes? Shall I turn it into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I turn back into a Pokémon? Choose! Now!
OK, I will do that! Turn that Fossil back into a Pokémon, surely I will!
You don’t wish that I extract any Pokémon from a Fossil. Fine, then!
I am in the process of extracting your Pokémon from a Fossil. You go outside, yes, please. Now! Time alone is what I now need. NOW!!!
You were gone too long! You kept us waiting! Unacceptable! This is your [VAR(256, 0, 0)]! You be good to it, OK! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the [VAR(256, 1, 0)]! 
Give a nickname to the [VAR(256, 1, 0)] you received?
But, no, I cannot do this! You have too many Pokémon with you! I must hold it for you, so come back, you, and take it away, please.
If it is a Fossil that you obtain, bring it to me if you must.
On the verge of a breakthrough, I am, to achieve extraction from Fossils. From Fossils I can extract Pokémon, but not yet, not yet.
Whoa! So this is coal? I never expected something this big! And that color! It really is as black as they say!
Wow! The Pokémon that carried this must be terribly strong!
Well, how about that! The Oreburgh Mine extends under the seafloor!
It’s a little far from here, but there is a city called Eterna City. I’ve heard a curious person named the Underground Man lives there. With a name like that, he must be an authority on the Underground.
Mining must take a strong mind, not just a tough body. Think about it. You’re in darkness, digging desperately through rock.
The history of Oreburgh Mine... You could call it a history of effort and friendship between people and Pokémon.
How Coal Is Made   1 “In a time long before history, vegetative matter was swept along by rain and rivers. It came to be buried under the ground.”
How Coal Is Made   2 “The buried plant matter was forced ever deeper under the ground due to tremors and fissures caused by the shifting landmasses.”
How Coal Is Made   3 “Deep under the ground, the plant matter was subjected to heavy pressure and the heat of magma. It gradually turned into coal.”
Samples of coal from different regions are displayed.
The box contains categorized samples of coal.
Different kinds of lamps are displayed. They appear to have been worn on someone’s head while underground.
Badly scarred wooden tools are displayed. They apparently dug out coal using these tools in the olden days.
The everyday items and tools of past mine workers are displayed.

Have you ever seen or heard about differently colored Pokémon? For instance, a regular PIKACHU has a yellow body, correct? Well, the different-colored PIKACHU has a sort of orange body.
You know how Pokémon have different natures like we have personalities? I don’t think it’s surprising to see Pokémon in different colors.
PIKACHU: Pikaaah!

Hiya! Your Pokémon could use some toughening up. Why not try training in the Oreburgh Mine?
I always have a rotten time trying to decide which moves my Pokémon should learn.
You remind me so much of the time I got my first Pokémon.

===============================
The Oreburgh Mine is operated with the utmost care. We avoid causing any damage to the natural habitats of Pokémon.
Wow... Your Pokémon’s eyes are twinkling brightly! Seeing that makes me happy! Here, I want you to have this! 
You know how Pokémon stay inside their Poké Balls? I try to think about what would be the best Poké Balls for them.
Coal is carried out of Oreburgh Mine on a fully automated system. Machines do all the work automatically. So, it’s all very easy.

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: What the... 
Cyrus: ...So, this is Eterna’s Pokémon statue... Shaping our world are time and space in an intertwining spiral. Revered in Sinnoh are the Pokémon of time and space... Sinnoh’s myth... Its truth needs investigation... 
...Pardon me. Stand aside. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Oh, hey! When we smacked together, a brilliant flash of inspiration came to me! An easy way to become a great Trainer! Yeah, that! All right. Listen close... Make certain all your attacks hit! Avoid enemy attacks for sure! You do that, you’d never lose! You’d be the invincible Trainer! Anyway, go check out the Pokémon statue. See you around! 
Oh, that device you have... It is a Pokédex? Wow, it brings back some memories. Pardon me, but what’s your name? ... OK, hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I’ll be sure to remember that name! My name is Cynthia. I’m a Trainer just like you. I’ve been studying Pokémon mythology lately, just out of curiosity. 
Here in Eterna City, there is a statue of an ancient Pokémon. Have you seen it already? According to myth, it was an extremely powerful Pokémon. Who knows? You may encounter something like it while you’re traveling with your Pokédex. Oh, I know! Try using this. It should be helpful. 
Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move Cut can be used in the field. It will let you go places that were previously inaccessible to you. That’s important for filling up your Pokédex, right? Then luck be with you, young Trainer! Oh, there’s one last thing! Please give my regards to Prof. Rowan. 
Cynthia: Oh, there you are! I was looking for you. I’ve got something nice. I wanted you to have this Pokémon Egg. Will you accept it?
Cynthia: That’s wonderful! The Pokémon inside the Egg is happy, too. I’m sure of it! 
Cynthia: Oh? You have six Pokémon with you already. You don’t have room for this Egg. You’ll have to store a Pokémon in a PC Box at the Pokémon Center first. I’ll give you this Egg when you’ve made room for it. I’ll be waiting right here.
Cynthia: Oh...? You don’t need to feel obligated. It’s hard filling the pages of the Pokédex, isn’t it? I only want to lend you a little hand, that’s all.
Cynthia: Oh, wait! Don’t leave without this Pokémon Egg. Please? I want you to have it. 
Cynthia: Well? Will you accept this Pokémon Egg?
                               
Cynthia: Keep that Egg with you in your party of Pokémon. A Pokémon will hatch from it while you are traveling. I would be happy to know that it will help fill another page of your Pokédex. See you again! 
Hi! I’m Gardenia! I’m this town’s Gym Leader! My last challenger was this awfully speedy young guy. ...Actually, his name was [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. He told me about you.

The challenger has to beat all the other Gym Trainers first. I’ll be waiting for you in the back, Trainer. Don’t disappoint me! 
Hey! You there, kid! Stay away from that Pokémon statue! Team Galactic is conducting an official investigation here!
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer! Errr... It’s OK. Never mind. You look tough. I won’t take... Um, I’ll just let you keep your Pokémon. Carry on!
Have you seen our building? Team Galactic is so stinking rich that we can have one built instantly!
Since that Team Galactic building went up, the city’s atmosphere has gotten all creepy and tense. I don’t know what those people are doing up in that place...
With Team Galactic gone, what’s going to happen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his favorite Pokémon away. I don’t think he’s telling the truth. Team Galactic looks so cool. They don’t look like common thugs.
Do you use your Bike’s kickstand? It looks cool to hop off your Bike and then snap it into place in one motion!
If you’re visiting Eterna, you need to get yourself a Bicycle and take a ride down the Cycling Road.
Oh, your Pokémon are rather fetching. Why, they look ready for Contests in Hearthome City!
They say this is an old city. It doesn’t look it, though. Not with all these tall buildings.
Eterna City’s not anything like it was before, way back in the day.
They say this is an awesome Pokémon that people saw long ago.
Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have an Explorer Kit? You should have a word with the man next door to the Pokémon Center.

I might’ve said it before, but you’re really tough! Wasn’t it hard for you to raise your Pokémon to be so good? I guess that’s a measure of how much you love your Pokémon. In recognition of that, I proudly grant you this! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Forest Badge from Gardenia!
With the Forest Badge, your Pokémon can use the hidden move Cut outside of battle. Now that you have two Gym Badges, all Pokémon you received in trades will obey you up to Lv. 30. I’ve also got something else. It’s a gift from me! 
That [VAR(264, 0, 0)] contains the move [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. It’s one of my favorite moves. The heavier the foe, the more damage this move will cause.
Yup! If there’s one thing I can tell about you, it’s this! You and your Pokémon are gonna get even tougher, and I mean seriously!
Welcome! Without further ado, let’s go! 
This gym’s floral clock... You can walk on its hands. That’s how you get to the next Trainer.
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some serious special attacks... I won’t let you win...easily! 
Every time you beat a Trainer, the floral clock moves. The fountain also stops if I lose. It’s so you can go to the Pokémon Center during your challenge.
You can’t win when you’re distracted by the lovely aromas of Pokémon! 
The floral clock moves, and time flows... There’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on, don’t be afraid!
The fountain’s water level dropped! It’s possible to walk across the fountain now!
Hey, there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? Actually, that’s what I said to some boy who zipped in here earlier, too! The Gym Leader, Gardenia, is a user of Grass-type Pokémon. It should be obvious, but Grass-type Pokémon really hate fire. They’re also at a huge disadvantage against the Flying type, too. Oh, wait a second. I should tell you about the Gym itself first. You can’t challenge the Gym Leader until you beat all the Gym’s Trainers. It’s a bit challenging, but just think of it as good training and go for it!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve beaten the Gym Leader! Your Pokémon look much tougher than when they went in, too! At least that’s how I see it!

Long ago, there was a Pokémon that merged with a toy robot. Should that Pokémon be recognized as a new species or not... Debates over the issue were about to start when they were rendered moot. The very topic of discussion--the Pokémon-infused robot--disappeared... 
Anyway, this ROTOM... What an interesting Pokémon. So, you say it enters an appliance and essentially merges with the device. In the process, it may also learn new moves.

“The Pokémon hovered in the air, held aloft by a power unseen. “As if curious and unafraid of my presence, it floated toward me. “Crackling sounds accompanied it, as  if from static electricity in the air. “Remarkably, it seemed the Pokémon was the source of this power! “In alarm, I flinched, certain that my face would be subjected to a shock. “Much to my surprise, the Pokémon seemed to favor me with a smile.” ...Would you like to keep reading?
“Finally, I came to realize that the Pokémon only wished to be friends. “I have decided to name this most wondrous Pokémon ’ROTOM.’ “Simple though it may be, ROTOM emerged to me from the motor of a lawn mower. “Motor and ROTOM... Surely the link is obvious?” ...Would you like to keep reading?
“ROTOM is a Pokémon that is simply sensational. “The fact that it can turn invisible is simply the beginning. “What makes ROTOM unique is its ability to enter and operate machinery!” ...This is about halfway through. Would you like to keep reading?
“ROTOM and I became fast friends. We were perpetual companions. “The electricity from its body forbade contact, however. “We could not touch, let alone hug or hold hands, but we cared not. “For we were bonded on a much deeper, incorporeal level.” ...Would you like to keep reading?
“A feeling of mischief got the better of me one day. “Seeing ROTOM hovering, I decided to startle it--normally I would not. “Perhaps frightened, ROTOM discharged power beyond its usual range. “I fell, stunned, into the arms of unconsciousness...” ...Would you like to keep reading?
“When I came to, to my horror I realized that ROTOM had disappeared. “I searched high and low for my friend in dismay and desperation. “’Don’t chastise yourself.’ “’The fault is mine. No harm done.’ “’Let us play as we always have.’ “Though my words poured out, my friend could not be found to hear them...” ...Would you like to keep reading?
“My search for ROTOM carried me far from home. “It was in the town’s rubbish heap that I again found my old toy robot. “Curiously, our eyes met, then the robot waved a hand as if in greeting. “I knew then that I had found my lost friend. “I ran to it and hugged ROTOM tight, talking on and on.” ...Would you like to keep reading?
“The robot’s eyes lit up happily as I held it. “I’m certain that, within it, ROTOM was  emitting lots of electricity. “Somehow, I felt I could understand ROTOM’s thoughts better than before. “Also, I realized that we would remain friends throughout our lives...” ...The notebook ends with this page...

Hello, hello! I am the official Name Rater! Want me to rate the nicknames of your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon’s nickname should I critique?
[VAR(257, 0, 0)], is it? That’s a decent nickname! But would you like to give it an even better name? How about it?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new nickname be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as [VAR(257, 0, 0)]! It is a better name than before! How fortunate for you!
I see. Please come visit again.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as [VAR(257, 0, 0)]! It looks no different from before, and yet, this is vastly superior! How fortunate for you!
[VAR(257, 0, 0)], is it? That is a truly impeccable name! Take good care of [VAR(257, 0, 0)]!
Now, now. That is merely an Egg! An Egg can go by no other name! 
Excuse me, but do you got that Pokémon named BUIZEL? Wanna trade it for my CHATOT?
Yes! So awesome! A BUIZEL! I so promise I’ll be good to it! Oh yeah, CHATOT can learn some human speech pretty quickly. Try out its move Chatter. You’ll totally see what I mean.
What I totally want is a BUIZEL...
Oh, OK. Totally got it. It’s all right if you don’t want to. But if you change your mind, let’s totally trade some Pokémon.
Did that CHATOT I traded you totally learn that Chatter move? It will mimic your speech if you use that move outside of battle. It’ll forget any speech you taught it if you stick it in a PC Box, though.

I’ve had this TM Recycle for such a long time now. It’s not anything that I have much use for these days. I do hope you’ll put it to good use, young Trainer. 
Folks like me have a long history we can look back on. Young people like you have only the future to look forward to.
Gardenia, our Gym Leader, goes out to Eterna Forest every so often. I always wonder what she does there.
The move Recycle is to be used during battle. When you use Recycle, a Pokémon can use its item once again.

Oh, my! You’ve met [VAR(308, 1, 0)] Pokémon! Wonderful! Yes, bravo! Professor Rowan should be delighted! Here is something for you! 
A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share will get some of the Exp. Points from battle. It will get Exp. Points even if it didn’t actually battle. Therefore, it should be held by a Pokémon you want to raise quickly. Also, a Pokémon you get in a trade may disobey you if it is too high in level. Don’t worry, though. It will obey if you have enough Gym Badges.
You’ve met only [VAR(308, 1, 0)] Pokémon? Hmm... You’ve got to find at least 35. If you can’t, it will be tough to complete the Sinnoh Pokédex.

Oak: Ah, it’s you! Good to see you! How is your Pokédex coming along? Capturing every kind of Pokémon is no easy feat, I’ll grant you that. But I’m sure you can accomplish it! 
Oak: Ah, yes! An acquaintance from Kanto has sent me something quite interesting. I think you’d make better use of it than I ever could. 
I understand there is a Pokémon that evolves when it is traded while holding that Up-Grade. 
Incidentally, and this is an entirely different topic... I’ve heard that there have been sightings of very rare Pokémon. The legendary bird Pokémon: ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES! They’ve been spotted at various locations here in Sinnoh, no less! Why, you may be lucky enough to see them yourself in your journeys!
Oak: ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES are extremely rare even in Kanto. There have been precious few sightings as it is. So why would they be spotted here in Sinnoh of all places? There are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon, it seems!
Oak: Ah, it’s you! How goes it? What’s that? You’ve caught ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES?! Now that is incredible! Well, then, allow me to examine your Pokédex.

Eterna came to be long ago in honor of ancient Pokémon. Though many things have changed, what is important has not. I hope it remains that way forever more...
Have you seen the Pokémon statue? When I was a wee child, it used to be the centerpiece of many festivals...
Sheesh!  What’s the world coming to?! Someone ripped off the descriptive plate from the Pokémon statue! Now no one can read the inscription! Why would someone do that? Actually, want to know what it said?
The first inscription went like this, sort of. “...creation of DIA... ...giver of time... “In laughter, there is tears... And, likewise... “The same time flows... ...the blessing of DIA...” Yikes... I’ve forgotten big chunks of it. Want to hear about the other inscription?
The second inscription went sort of like this. “...birth of PAL... ...creator of parallel dimensions... “Alive, yet not alive... ...rifts in space... “To arrive in the same univer... ...the blessing of PAL...” I’ve heard some people talk about there once being a third inscription. I’m kind of skeptical, though. I mean, think about it. A third Pokémon alongside those that control time and space? There couldn’t possibly be a Pokémon that mighty.
Well, if you’re not interested, don’t feel obligated or anything.

I am! I am the first to have gone underground and dug some tunnels. You can call me the Underground Man. Everyone else does. I’ll make a gift of this to you. You hold up your end of the deal and put it to good use! 
My gift to you, the Explorer Kit, will instantly take you underground! You need only to use it, and you will be down in the tunnels! The Underground is a different world where you can do this, that, and the other thing, too! Let me mentor you into becoming a full-fledged spelunker! Will you take on that challenge?
Let me mentor you as you become a full-fledged spelunker! Will you take on that challenge?
I had hoped to teach a youngster like you about the many charms of the underground tunnels... But I can’t force you to accept my proposal if you’re not inclined. Sigh... I get so lonely sometimes...
Hm! Well said, my young friend! I will teach you by assigning missions. First, go underground! Going underground is quite easy. Simply use your Explorer Kit. If you accomplish that, I will give you your next test.
You’ve not gone underground yet? To get down to the underground tunnels, you need only to use your Explorer Kit. But you need to be outside. It can’t be used indoors or in a cave. Now, off you go!
Hm! I see that you’ve gone down to the underground tunnels! Well done! Take these as rewards! 
Those are called Traps. They’re triggered when stepped on. The Underground is a place where you can go with your friends. You might try setting those Traps when you’re down there with others. Now, what should I assign you next...
How was it in the underground tunnels? Big and empty, I would think. But that’s only because you are a novice spelunker! There are many hidden things down there that are not visible to the eye. For my next test, I want you to dig up some Treasure or Spheres for me. While underground, check the Radar for yellow spots. Go to such a location and search for Treasure using the Touch Screen.
You’ve not located any Treasure  or Spheres yet? Listen. Check the Radar and go to any yellow spot that’s shown. Next, use the Touch Screen to identify places to dig. Try to get right on top of a yellow spot on the Radar, OK? Once you are right in front of it, press the A Button! Now, off you go on your search!
Ah! You dug up what I was looking for! Good job on finding it! Well done, indeed! Take these as your reward! 
Dig in the walls of the underground tunnels to unearth hidden stuff. Fossils and Stones can be dug up and brought out from down under. Spheres, which are gems, cannot be brought out, but they can be exchanged for goods down there. Now, what should I assign you next...?
My tests aren’t over yet! Next, let’s use some Spheres! The Spheres one can find underground are very peculiar. When buried in the ground, they grow daily, a little bit at a time. I want you to go bury these strange Spheres in the Underground. That is my latest test!
You’ve not buried the Spheres yet? You’re afraid of losing them? Have no fear! Spheres are easily buried and just as easily dug up. Don’t be afraid. Go bury those Spheres like I’ve said. Just don’t forget where you’ve buried them--the Underground is huge!
Good, good! You’ve buried your Spheres! The next time you go underground, they should have grown bigger! Just don’t forget where you’ve buried your Spheres! Anyway, well done! This is your reward! 
You may have seen them already, but there are Sphere collectors. They wander about in the underground tunnels seeking Spheres. They’ll happily trade you items for big Spheres. Now, what shall I assign you next...?
Have you grown weary of repeatedly going back to the Underground? Well, it’s not over yet! Next up is your Secret Base! That’s right, I will teach you how to make your own Secret Base! All you need is the Digger Drill I gave you earlier. Simply go underground and use the Digger Drill wherever you like. That will instantly make you your very own Secret Base! So, your next assignment is: go make your own Secret Base!
Hm? You don’t know how to use the Digger Drill? OK, I’ll admit this test may have been a little tricky for you. All you need to do is find the Digger Drill among your Traps. Then, face a wall and use the Digger Drill. That’s all it takes. Do that and you’ll have your Secret Base before you can say... [VAR(65281, 200)]Boo![VAR(65281, 100)] No, seriously though!
Ah, you’ve made your Secret Base! Excellent! I thought I might have been asking too much of you, but you did it! Well done! Take these as your reward! 
Incidentally, a Digger Drill can be used only once. If you wish to move your Secret Base, you will need to obtain another Digger Drill. You can trade a Sphere for one underground. What should I make you do next...
Hm! You’ve stuck it out to the end! This is my final test. You’ve made yourself a Secret Base, but it’s totally empty, is it not? Not to worry! You can decorate your own Secret Base as you see fit! So! For my final test, I want you to decorate your Secret Base. Use furniture and interior goods to give your Secret Base character!
Ah, have I finally managed to stump you? Perhaps you’ve left your Secret Base’s door open? You see, the underground tunnels are visited by many Trainers. It wouldn’t do to have someone barge in on you while you’re working on your Secret Base. Don’t forget to close the door while you’re redecorating!
Ah! You’ve even managed to decorate your Secret Base! I knew I recognized a spelunker in you! Don’t forget to close the door when you’re decorating! We don’t want any visitors getting hurt by walking in on you! Also, if you want to place goods you’ve received, store them in the PC first. Anyway, well done! This is your reward! 
There are ways of collecting more decoration goods. You can grow Spheres you’ve found and trade them for goods. It’s also possible to obtain goods from friends.
I’ve taught you all I know, but if you insist, there is one more thing I should tell you. The Secret Base you’ve made has Big Boulders that get in the way, yes? There is actually a way of moving those boulders aside... However, the task may be dangerous for you now. I suppose I could tell you how when you get better as a spelunker... 
...Hm! However, you are someone I’d recognized as a born spelunker... Fine! I will tell you, but only because you’re exceptional! You know that you may go underground with your friends, correct? That means your friends are certain to have Secret Bases of their own. Now, this is what you must do: First, find a friend’s Secret Base. Next, go to the PC and steal your friend’s Flag. Then, run back to your Secret Base and take the Flag to your PC! If you can do that, I will permit you to move boulders.
Ah! My spelunker! Are you spelunking with your friends? It’s a hundred times more fun to play with friends underground! If you manage to steal a Flag from a friend’s Secret Base, you be sure to come show me!
Wait! Don’t tell me! You’ve captured a Flag? Excellent! You should already be capable of moving Big Boulders inside your Secret Base! You can shunt aside a boulder by storing it like furniture. Anyway, well done! This is your reward! 
There really is nothing else that I can teach you. If you wish to put away more Big Boulders or put out more goods, keep capturing more Flags. Become the spelunking master for me!
So, my spelunker, are you going underground with your friends? The underground tunnels are vast. They can be a place where you meet many others like you.
Ah, you’ve captured three Flags! Well done! Take this as your reward! 
Ah, you’ve captured ten Flags! Well done! Take this as your reward! 
Oh! Oh! My goodness! You’ve captured fifty Flags! Fantastic! Take this as your reward! 
You have been outstanding! There really is nothing left to teach you. From now on, you are the spelunking master!
Oh? Your underground PC appears to be full. Discard a decorative item or two, then come see me again.
Hm! This belongs to you! 
The underground tunnels go everywhere! Grab your friends and let’s play together using DS Wireless Communications!
All I ever unearth are Armor Fossils. My buddy only digs up Skull Fossils. I wonder why that happens? It doesn’t matter though. I can just swap them with my buddy. I simply let a Pokémon hold an Armor Fossil and trade it to him.
Let’s dig up some Treasure! I’m from Oreburgh. I work at the mining museum there. I got advice from the Underground Man on digging up Treasure and Spheres. Before I get digging, let me share his advice with you. While you’re digging, you may uncover dark rocks. They are very hard! If you keep hitting them, the wall will collapse. Don’t forget that, and you’ll be digging up Treasure in no time!
Oh, you’d like more advice on digging up Treasure and Spheres? Well, your Explorer Kit contains a sledgehammer and a pickax. Choose either of these tools and touch the lower screen to dig. You get to keep the stuff you fully uncover before the wall collapses. Don’t forget, the dark rocks are impossible to break. If you hit them too often, the wall will collapse. Don’t forget that, and you’ll be digging up Treasure in no time!
New and on sale! Underground Radar! The upper radar screen indicates possible Treasure locations. The lower Touch Radar indicates precise locations!
“Shortcut to the Underground” is on the screen. 
Which heading would you like to read?
Flags: A Flag can be found in every Secret Base. Capture a friend’s Flag and take it to your own Secret Base to make improvements to it! Find your friends’ Secret Bases and capture their Flags! 
Spheres: In the underground tunnels, you can dig up pretty stones that are called Spheres. There are people underground that treat Spheres like money. Trade them your Spheres in exchange for decoration goods and other items. These Spheres also have the strange property of growing if they are buried in the ground. 
Traps: There are Traps that can be put down in the underground tunnels. There are many kinds of Traps for unwary Trainers under the ground. Some Traps need to be blown away. Some need to be removed by touch. 
Goods: These are furniture and decorative items for Secret Bases. Collect goods by exchanging Spheres for them, or by getting gifts from friends! 
Treasure: These are rare items that appear while digging underground. They can be taken out of the Underground if placed in your Bag while in the tunnels. Dig around all over and find Treasure!

Oh, thank goodness that you happened to be there! If it weren’t for you, who knows how far away my BUNEARY could have run... 
Baby BUNEARY, back into the Poké Ball you go! 
I’m Keira! I’m a Pokémon Contest Judge. Be sure to drop by the Contest Hall so I can thank you properly! 
Hey, there! How’s it going, Trainer? You being here tells me you’re going to challenge the Gym Leader. Well... I hate to break it to you, but that’s impossible. You’re questioning why, and the answer is: she’s not here. Not to worry, though. We know she’s at the Contest Hall. Come back another time, OK? I’ll be waiting right here.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Ta-daah! Kept me waiting again, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! Let’s see how much tougher you and I have gotten, right here and now! Hey, you’re a Trainer now. You’re expected to be ready for a battle. No whining! No waiting! Let’s get the show started! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Waaah! What are you saying? I lost again?! It goes to show my surefire winning strategy doesn’t work. Say, hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. Remember what I told you before? Make sure all your attacks hit! Avoid every enemy attack! I thought that was a wicked strategy, but it doesn’t work worth beans. I guess I have to grind it out and toughen up the team a bit at a time. Anyway! Where to next? The closest place is Solaceon Town, I think? That’ll do! I’m off to Solaceon Town! See ya, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! You’ll be shocked by my growth the next time we meet! 
Did you know? They found an Egg at the Day Care in Solaceon Town past here.
Did you know? They find Eggs in the far-off Johto region, too.
You’re a Trainer, are you? You’ve got two choices of challenges, either the Gym or a Contest, right?
At the Lost Tower, people unburden themselves of unbearable sorrow... You’ll understand what I mean if you visit the Lost Tower on Route 209.
This place is beautiful. Perhaps even too much so. Pokémon, people, and nature are in perfect harmony here.
I can’t decide what Accessories I should dress up Pokémon with. There are just so many kinds.
I get to see Pokémon all day long, but there sure are many kinds. How many are there now?
I used a Fire Stone on my Pokémon, and it evolved!
I’m visiting here all the way from the Hoenn region. I had been hoping to find the Contest Hall, but being new, I lost my way. Fortunately, the local people very kindly led me to my destination. I was impressed by their kindness and generosity to a complete stranger. Now, may I offer you the courtesy of showing you to the Contest Hall?
Ah. Please follow me. 
This is the Contest Hall. Please, do go inside.
It makes me happy knowing I’ve helped another person.
Oh, I do apologize. I should mind my own business.
When I take my baby out in his stroller, I see the town in a different way. I notice things like stairs and bumps in the sidewalk.
Apapapu!
I went for a stroll in Amity Square with my PACHIRISU today. We came across a Pokémon feather while we walked. Do you think it’d make my PACHIRISU look any cuter?
PACHIRISU: Kyukyuuh!
I have a professor friend, and this is what he told me. If you leave a pair of Pokémon with the Day Care, sometimes Eggs are found. Or things that are like Eggs, anyway. I wonder how my pal Prof. Elm is doing these days? He was always a quiet sort and didn’t really stand out.
They call me Mr. Goods. No one knows my real name. No, not even I do... I dedicate myself to seeking rarities. It’s what I live for. 
Hm! Hmhmhmhm?! 
                   
I was going to give you something, but I just gave a rare thing away. I’ll find something else for you, so just talk to me some other time.
             
                       
Oh? Your underground PC appears to be full. I’ll hold your gift until you make room for it. Tell me when, OK?
                                             
I’ll find something rare for you, so talk to me some other time.

If you feed your Pokémon Poffins routinely, you’ll be able to enter Contests whenever you like.

Why Trainers choose certain kinds of Pokémon and their feelings about it... That’s what we’re investigating.
I felt a flash of inspiration when I laid eyes on you. I’d really love to capture you on camera while you’re battling.
For close-ups, I need to get in tight. You don’t mind, do you?

Hello, hello! How, I say, do you do? I am the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman! Indeed, yes I am! When you wish to treat your Pokémon to a treat, what, I say, do you do? If I may say so, and I will, I feed Poffins to my Pokémon! And why, I say, would I do that? Because the giving of Poffins is a way of expressing your love! For example! If I were to give a Sweet Poffin, the Pokémon eating it would become more cute! For example! A Spicy Poffin will add to the coolness of a Pokémon! In such ways I say that Poffins have nothing but goodness for Pokémon! Therefore! I declare this Poffin Case to be a gift from me to you! 
I urge you to fill it with Poffins and be generous in dispensing them to your Pokémon!
Nationwide, there are other fan clubs, but we are number one! And why are we number one? Because I brag more than anyone! But now I can’t brag as much... People started complaining, so I’ve had to curtail my bragging...

When I get bigger, I’m going to be a Trainer, too!
When I grow up, I want to become a Pokémon coordinator.

Oh, wow, you’re a Pokémon Trainer. Having lots of Pokémon around is a lot of responsibility. But that also comes with a lot of fun!

Bebe: Oh, OK... Guess I’ll have to raise it myself.
Bebe: My buddy Bill developed the basic Pokémon Box storage system. I tinkered with it here and there to make it easier to use.
Bebe: Oh? Now that’s a National Pokédex I’m seeing. Good for you! You’ll be using my Pokémon Boxes a whole lot more if you’ve got that. Well, I always thought a good Trainer ought to juggle Boxes smartly, though. I shouldn’t be the one to say so.

Hi! Let’s get cooking! Here’s my advice on cooking tasty Poffins for your Pokémon crew! In the beginning, while it’s still a batter, swirl it gently and avoid spillage. When it starts to harden, churn it fast in big circles! At the end, make a wish for it to turn scrumptious and whirl it!
Have you got some Berries? To make delicious Poffins, the key ingredient is a rare Berry. And, the more cooks you have, the more delicious the Poffin!
Eating good food makes people and Pokémon more energetic and happy. In that sense, we’re exactly alike.
At the Wi-Fi Club, I can cook up Poffins with my friends!

She is, how do you say, très fantastique! Fantina being myself, of course! Mmm, let me see... You also seem to be très strong. Enfin, so it shall be. I wait for you at the Gym! 
You’re going to enter Contests? But I don’t see a Poffin Case. It could be tough for you to win Contests without it. But if you’re determined to enter, don’t let me stop you. It wouldn’t hurt to get in some practice at the counter on the right.

For the Visual judging, you want to dress up your Pokémon nicely with Accessories matched to the theme. That means you’ll be at an advantage if you have lots of Accessories.
For the Dance competition, your Pokémon needs to perfectly mimic the dance steps of the lead dancer.
For the performance aspect of Contests, Pokémon need the right kinds of moves. But what’s even more important is your choice of the Judge. If everyone performs for the same Judge, your Pokémon leaves less of an impression on that Judge.
At the Cool Contest you gotta pull off a cool move! Gets the Judges all excited! If the Judge’s excitement peaks, you score massive bonus points! So hot!

And there do I see my father. My son. My life. And there do I see nature. Pokémon. The world.
The art of crafting things fatigues one’s spirit. When the spirit is healed, the desire to make something returns. It is such a wondrous cycle.
When people and Pokémon join hands, everyone’s happy. It makes everyone come together. It could even make the world one!
That people are lonely is only natural. It gives me compassion for others. It’s what makes me look forward to a better tomorrow. But there are still moments of fondness for the past. Though, time can heal some sadness...
There are still words that not everyone can describe... The words are “love” and “joy.”
Pokémon... People... It’s only natural that we are all so very different. Make sure that you never judge a Pokémon on if it’s weak or strong. You must always look for the good inside of them. That’s what counts!
If the strong and able do too much, they limit the contributions of others. The strong must show restraint. This enables everyone to live together and share responsibility.
We cannot read the minds of others, which causes us to feel fear and doubt. But to control the aspects of the world beyond our senses is an impossibility. 
Mind and matter. It’s no good if one is stronger than the other. Balance is what’s needed. That’s the key.

Well, let’s see! Which town will we go to next?
Come on, let’s show off our Pokémon! Let’s do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit’s vibes... You’ve got rock in your veins! 
My guitar... It lies broken and weeping...
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit, too! That’s why a battle is rock!

Welcome to the Great Marsh, the home of Pastoria’s Safari Game! All you can catch for just $500! Would you like to play a Safari Game?
That will be $500, please. 
Here are your Safari Balls. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received 30 Safari Balls. 
We’ll let you know when your game is over. Until then, enjoy yourself, please! Off you go on your wild excursion! 
OK. Please come again! 
You don’t have enough money. Sorry. 
I’m sorry, you don’t have enough room to catch any more Pokémon. 
Welcome to the Great Marsh, the home of Pastoria’s Safari Game! Recently, there have been sightings of Pokémon that are new to the area. Which brings us to... All you can catch for just $500! Would you like to play a Safari Game?
You still have time left. Are you sure you want to exit the Great Marsh?
OK. I’ll relieve you of your remaining Safari Balls. Thank you for playing. We hope to see you again. 
Please enjoy the rest of your wild Safari Game adventure! 
Welcome to the Great Marsh! Is this your first Safari Game?
When you enter the Great Marsh, you start with 30 Safari Balls. That’s the only kind of Ball you’re allowed to use in the Safari Game. The game is over when you run out of Safari Balls, or when you’ve walked 500 steps. Please do enjoy the untamed nature of the Great Marsh!
I see. Enjoy your Safari Game!
Howdy. You’re playing the Safari Game? How would you like to try my game out at the same time? The rule--yep, there’s only one--is real simple. All you have to do is capture five or more Pokémon in one Safari Game. If you can do that, I’ll give you the Pokétch app Matchup Checker.
                                                               
                                                                                                                     
So, how many Pokémon did you catch in your Safari Game? At least five? Ayup! You’ve done that all right! Isn’t that something! Well, here you are, then. The Pokétch app Matchup Checker. 
The Matchup Checker app figures out how Pokémon types match up. It won’t help tell us how we match up as friends, though.

It’s a pair of binoculars... Put $100 in it?
Not enough money...
Tell me I’m not imagining this... The Great Marsh’s Pokémon seem to be different from the ones yesterday...
Use a pair of binoculars to look out over the Great Marsh. You can see what kinds of Pokémon can be caught, and where they are.
There are shuttle trains in the marsh called Quick Trams. You should take those if you’re going to a deeper area in the marsh.
When you’re walking on the bog, you sometimes sink right in... There’s something pretty cool about it, though. If you turn while you’re stuck, sometimes Pokémon may pop out.

The Pokémon COMBEE is quite interesting. Only the female evolves and grows strong. The male does not. Come to think of it, my wife was awfully strong, too. She evolved from my bride to the mother of our kids.
Hey, have you caught both the female and male forms of COMBEE? If you have, I want to see both of them together. I’ll give you a Macho Brace if you do that for me. Deal?
Aww, you don’t even have a single COMBEE? It’s so cute how they’re attracted by the aroma of Honey. Let me see a male and female COMBEE together, OK? I’ll give you a Macho Brace if you do that for me.
That’s it! A COMBEE! It’s sooooo cute! It’d be even cooler if you had the other gender COMBEE as well, though. By the way, a female COMBEE’s kind of rare, so they’re popular. Still, it’d be great to see a male and female at the same time. I’ll give you a Macho Brace if you do that for me.
Cool! A female and a male COMBEE. I feel giddy! Here’s your reward like I promised. Go ahead, take it! 
Whoops, your Bag is crammed full! I’ll give this to you later.
You’re good! You’d make an awesome Bug Maniac!

Everyone calls me the Pokémon Move Maniac. I prefer Move Tutor. I know every move that Pokémon learn while they’re leveling up, and I can teach Pokémon those moves. I can teach a move to a Pokémon of yours if you’d like. I’ll do it if you’ll trade me a Heart Scale. 
Oh! That’s it! That’s an honest-to- goodness Heart Scale! Let me guess, you want me to teach one of your Pokémon a move? 
If any of your Pokémon needs to learn a move, come back with a Heart Scale.
Which Pokémon needs tutoring? 
Which move should I teach? 
Sorry... There isn’t any move I can teach that Pokémon.
Hunh? Don’t you think it’d be tough for an Egg to learn a move?

Hmhm... I see... 
This isn’t what I had hoped to see... I can’t lie to you, so I’ll just have to tell it to you straight. This Pokémon’s not bad, but it’s not good, either. It’s just so-so. If you want to improve this one’s condition, feed it some more Poffins!
Your Pokémon is growing up really well. My hat’s off to you. I was going to give you a scarf, but your Bag’s full.

The Green Scarf represents the spring breeze! Let a Pokémon hold it to give it an edge in Smart Contests.

Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Please, can you help me? Some Team Galactic goons took my Pokédex away from me. I need your help to get it back. I’ll be waiting in front of the warehouses. Please come! 
Lucas: Hey! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Listen, I need your help... Some Team Galactic goons grabbed my Pokédex and won’t give it back. I sure could use your help. I’ll be waiting in front of the warehouses. Please come! 
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], are you going to take the Gym challenge? Gee, you keep getting tougher and tougher, don’t you? Me? Well, I went shopping at the department store, and... I mean, well, of course I’ve been working on my Pokédex, but... 
Lucas: Hey! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], are you going to take on the Gym Leader? Wow, you just keep getting tougher and tougher. Me? Well, I took a look in the Game Corner, and... I mean, yeah, of course I’ve been working on my Pokédex, but... Anyway, keep it up! 
The ring is my roiling sea. ♫ The towering waves shaped me. Crash! Crash! Crasher Wake! Crash! Crash! Crasher Wake! I’m the tidal wave of power to wash you away! Put out the fire, Crasher Wake! Run from electricity, Crasher Wake! Ah, ah, aaaah! The ring is my sea. ♫ 
Hello, dude and young lady! You’re challenging the Gym Leader, are you? Let me tell you now, she’s young, but she’s a born genius. I tried training with her, and I was stunned by how tough she was! 
Whoops! I’d better tell you who I am! I’m the triple-threat Gym Leader in Pokémon, wrestling, and song. I’m Crasher Wake of Pastoria Gym! We’ll meet again! 
Dawn: ... 
So, uh, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Good luck on your Gym challenge. 
Lucas: ... 
So, uh, yeah, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Good luck with the Pokémon Gym. 
Grunt 1: Hey, you! Yeah, you! This is Team Galactic’s warehouse! It ain’t no playground for kids! 
Grunt 1: Hey, you! Yeah, you! This is Team Galactic’s warehouse! It ain’t no playground for kids!
Grunt 2: This is the awesome Team Galactic’s awesome warehouse! A little kid like you should be playing at the Pokémon Gym. After all, the Gym Leader happens to be a kid just like you!
Grunt 1: What? Now you’ve brought your buddy along so you can get your Pokédex back? We’ll be just as happy to send both of you crying home to your mommies!
Grunt 2: You’re trying to get the Pokédex back from us? Not when we, Team Galactic, can make so much better use of it! But, OK, guarding the warehouse does get boring! We’ll take you on two-on-two!
Grunt 1: Aww, that stinks! Our Pokémon are chumps! We should get new ones from headquarters. Humph! Who cares about some Pokédex anyway? Team Galactic’s going to own all the Pokémon in the world... No, in the universe! 
There! Take it! Take your Pokédex! 
Grunt 2: Those things we had in the warehouse’ve already been moved to Pastoria City anyway... So, we’ll say “You’ll get yours!” And run like the grunts we are. 
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Please, can you help me? Do you remember Team Galactic? Those horrible people? They tried to steal Prof. Rowan’s research results in Jubilife, remember? I ran into them, and they took away my Pokédex. Please, I need your help. Team up and battle with me!
Dawn: You and your Pokémon together with me and my Pokémon... United like this, our dream team has no chance of losing! I’m not letting those bad people get away with their dirty deeds! 
Dawn: I’ll be waiting. Please get ready and come quickly.
Dawn: What’s going on? Why is Team Galactic out in the streets like they own the place? 
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], thank you, sincerely. I would’ve been lost without my Pokédex. It’s indispensable for helping Prof. Rowan with his studies. So, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], what are you going to do now? I’m thinking of going to the Pokémon Mansion on Route 212. I hear they show rare Pokémon to visitors there. 
Lucas: Hey! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Listen, I need your help... Remember those Team Galactic goons? The guys who tried to take Prof. Rowan’s research results in Jubilife? I ran into them, and they ripped off my Pokédex! Will you team up with me to take them on?

Lucas: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], thanks, honestly. I’m useless without my Pokédex. I have to have it for helping Prof. Rowan with his studies. So, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], what are your plans now? I think I’m off to the Pokémon Mansion on Route 212. They say they show off rare Pokémon to visitors. 
Looker: Have no fear, I have come running. I heard of children feuding with the Team Galactic. It turns out, of course, to be you. 
Dawn: Oh... It’s that funny man from Jubilife... 
Lucas: Hey... It’s that weirdo from Jubilife. 
Looker: You insult me to my face? How very uncouth of you. 
Dawn: I’m terribly sorry. Team Galactic took my Pokédex, so I was very irritated... I just blurted it out... ...I should be going now. Be wary of Team Galactic. 
Lucas: Oh, sorry. Honestly. I was upset from having my Pokédex ripped off by Team Galactic. I didn’t even think when I spoke up. I’ll be going now. Uh... Watch out for Team Galactic. 
Looker: It is of no matter. Of more interest is the criminal behavior of the Team Galactic. They attempt to steal the belongings of a child? The scale of their criminality, it seems rather minuscule. The triviality of their action makes them more sinister, perhaps. Their warehouse needs investigation. Come with me, and we’ll take a look! 
There! Would you look at those antennae? I don’t know what they do, but those are some mighty impressive antennae! 
Hey! It’s you! I bet you don’t remember me, but I sure remember you! Because of you, they took my CLEFAIRY away... My partner called it quits and went back to his old country... Waah! I know nothing! I don’t know anything about any Storage Key! 
Ah-hah! You leave this to me! The Storage Key for entering the Team Galactic hideout, I have right here. A frontal assault, it is not possible. But we can enter their hideout. Well? Will you enter the hideout? You have your reasons, yes?
Very well. Inside the Team Galactic warehouse. We will meet there. Prepare the best you can. I shall join you shortly. 
Looker: ...Yes, I see your point. Sneaking into the hideout of the Team Galactic...it is daunting.

I bought a new parasol. But I don’t want it to get rained on, so I watch the TV weather reports.

Veilstone is the city of stone. We even have meteorites! This has nothing to do with anything, but take this Technical Machine! 
If someone uses Embargo on your Pokémon, it becomes impossible to use any items on it. Anyway, enjoy your visit to Veilstone, the city of...well, stone.

Did you want some game Coins? It’s $1000 for 50 Coins. Would you like some?
Thank you very much! Here are your Coins!
Um... You don’t appear to have enough money...
Oh? Your Coin Case is full.
Oh... You don’t need Coins, then? Please come again!
Ten straight bonus rounds on the slots! That’s amazing! I would say you had an explosion of good luck! So, please take this Technical Machine as a memento! 
Please keep playing the slots for another explosion of good luck!
Oh, your Bag is full... We will hold the TM for you.
We’re still amazed by your ten straight bonus rounds on the slots before. I would say you had an explosion of good luck! So, please take this Technical Machine as a memento! 
You can’t play if you don’t have a Coin Case.
I’ll explain how the slot machines work at this Game Corner. During regular play, you should stop the reels from the left. During the bonus round, watch where CLEFAIRY points and stop the reels in that order.
Hey, kid, if you want to play here, you need a Coin Case. I think the young man next door had one.
I’ve been winning a ton today. Here, take some Coins! [VAR(259, 0, 0)] received 20 Coins from the man. [VAR(259, 0, 0)] put the Coins away in the Coin Case.

Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look! Yeahah! It’s a carnival! Let me share some of my joy with you! [VAR(259, 0, 0)] received 50 Coins from the man. [VAR(259, 0, 0)] put the Coins away in the Coin Case.
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! It’s adorable! Just seeing it gets my pulse racing! Oh, let me impart a piece of advice to you! If the moon turns red, you don’t want to get a replay because it makes CLEFAIRY tired!
I want Coins, of course, but setting records is hot, too!
When a Poké Ball appears, it’s a chance to line up slot marks. Replays and PIKACHU line up even if you don’t make an effort. But you need to aim for better marks, like Poké Balls and Moon Stones.
A friend in my group scored a ton of Coins here. Why mess with a good thing? I’ll try the same spot, too!
Sigh... Nothing’s going my way today... Are you a Trainer? Did you battle the Gym Leader? She happens to be my daughter. She’s some kind of tough!
Looker: Ah, it is you, yes. Examine, if you will, the reels. The Team Galactic logo, it is here. Further investigation is needed, and I am just the man to do it. Also, where the masses gather, so too does information. ...Ack. My streak is broken.
Looker: Ah, it is you, yes. I have decided to use the opportunity of being here in Sinnoh. I am therefore trying to teach moves to Pokémon that I have captured. Also, if I have nothing to do, it means the world, it is at peace. ...Ack. My streak is broken.
Shoot for 10! Line up those bonus rounds! If you accomplish the feat of completing 10 uninterrupted bonus rounds, please go to the counter. You will be presented with a fabulous prize! The current record sits at [VAR(308, 0, 0)] straight bonus rounds!

Prof. Rowan: Hmm... Rage Candy Bars are too popular, it seems. 
Ah, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], it’s you. Does life continue to thrill you? It does for me. For example, I recently discovered some Pokémon evolve only in certain locations. When I learned that, I felt thrilled!
I didn’t expect to find paradise in the department store’s basement. I got carried away and bought up all the Rage Candy Bars!
I’m hopeless at cooking Poffins, so I buy them here. I wish I could feed my babies Poffins that I made myself, though.
Pay attention, please. The flavors of Poffins affect the condition of Pokémon. Spicy Poffins enhance coolness. Dry Poffins enhance beauty. Sweet Poffins enhance cuteness. Bitter Poffins enhance smartness. And Sour Poffins enhance toughness. Sigh... Poffins are wonderful, aren’t they?
Welcome to the basement--the food and produce section. We offer a fine and pleasing selection of Pokémon food and treats.
Have you ever planted Berries, then promptly forgotten about them? If that’s you, we have Berries on sale, too.
Hello! Rage Candy Bars... I’m all sold out. I’m terribly sorry.
Hello, there. Would you like some Lava Cookies? They’re $200 each.
Here you go, one Lava Cookie. Thank you.
Here you go, ten Lava Cookies. Thank you very much.

I’m sorry, but you don’t have enough money.

Hello! I sell Poffins. The ones I sell go for $6,400 each. Would you like one?

Thank you very much. Please do shop with us again.
I’m so sorry, but you don’t have enough money.
Oh... Your Poffin Case is already full.

I’ll tell you what type your Pokémon’s Hidden Power will be. My own hidden power lets me do that.

You’re a Trainer, aren’t you? You see, there’s this Pokémon I’d like someone to look after. It’s a Pokémon called PORYGON. Can you take it off my hands?
Excellent! Thanks! That’ll make the PORYGON happy, too. I suspect it ran away from those Team Galactic goons.

Thanks! ...But, oops, you already have a whole team of Pokémon with you. If you want this PORYGON, you’d better put one in a PC Box first.
Is that so... I’ll look after it for a while. Please come see me if you change your mind.
Team Galactic’s building bugs me so much, I can’t sleep well. It’s so bizarre, like a robot that’s about to start moving.
Those thorny things on the building... The way it moves meaninglessly... I don’t understand their idea of  “awesomely fashionable” at all. Still, Team Galactic does seem to have a huge supply of energy.

Yo! Fellow Trainer! Your Pokémon are secure inside their Poké Balls, but there’s no masking that aura of serious toughness! Oops, sorry, I should introduce myself. The name’s Flint! I’m one of the Pokémon League’s Elite Four! 
I just had this idea. Maybe you can pull it off. It’s about this town’s Gym Leader. He’s really lost his enthusiasm lately because there’ve been so few good challengers worth his time. He’s been so bored, he spends all his time renovating the Gym. And then the blackout happened... That sure didn’t help lift his mood. You know where I’m going with this, don’t you? I need you to give him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his passion for battling. I’m counting on you, hotshot! 
Flint: Yo! Hiya! He hasn’t come back yet. When he does, you know what you’ve gotta do. Give him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his passion for battling! I’m counting on you, hotshot!
Flint: Yo! Hiya! He’s finally come back! He seemed to be feeling upbeat, too. I have a hunch that he recognized your toughness right away. I bet he’s getting excited over the thought of battling you. Remember what you have to do, hotshot. Give him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his passion for battling! All right, hotshot! I’ll be waiting at the Pokémon League! 
...Er...um... M-my name is Jasmine, and I’m a Gym Leader. Oh, I’m sorry, not the Gym Leader of this town... I’m a Gym Leader in the Johto region... ...Er...um... It would be nice if you knew about the Johto region... 
Oh, if you don’t have the Gym Badge, you’ll be forced to turn back.
This isn’t much, but... 
...That Hidden Machine... It contains Waterfall. If you use it, you can get to the Pokémon League. ...Um... I... I don’t know how I should say this, but good luck. 
Jasmine: ...This city makes me feel at home somehow. It’s next to the sea, and there’s a lighthouse... 
Jasmine: ...I came from very far away because I wanted to get stronger. On the way, I met all sorts of  people with their Pokémon... They all looked like they were having fun. I felt happy seeing it.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Hey! [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! What the... You went and got all eight Gym Badges of Sinnoh! Aww, you... That’s wicked! I envy you! But don’t think you’ve won! 
Because I’m going to be the toughest Trainer ever! You watch me! Before I was dreaming. I just wanted to be like my dad. Now, things are different. I thought about what being a Trainer involves. I thought about what Pokémon are. We’re going to get tougher one step at a time! 
I’m not going to challenge you to a battle now. I hate to say it, but I know you’re tougher than me. But not a whole lot tougher. Just a little. Our difference is about a yard? Nah, not even an inch. ...What I’m trying to say is that I will catch up to you in no time. If you don’t hurry to the Pokémon League, I’ll leave you in my wake! 
Jasmine: ...Was that your friend? Seeing how you two got along made me happy somehow. It must be wonderful having a friend like that. A person that you can share anything and everything with. A person you can compete with without fighting. ...Um, it made me feel sort of warm seeing you two. It may seem odd, but I’d like you to have this as my thanks.

Hey, there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? Let me check out your Trainer Case. Let’s see how many Badges you have. One, two, three... Whoa! Wow! You’ve already got seven! That means if you can beat this Gym Leader, you’re on your way to the Pokémon League next. That also means this is the last time I get to give you advice. This is it, kiddo! Listen carefully...one last time! The Gym Leader here is a master of Electric-type Pokémon! That’s all I have to say. The rest is up to you!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Did you beat the Gym Leader? Well, of course you did! But, you know what? You haven’t made it in my mind yet! Do you know why? Because you and your Pokémon are capable of achieving so much more! But, I am proud of you! Eight Sinnoh Badges! Way to go, kiddo!

...All right, challenger. It’s not often, but some Trainers manage to come and challenge me. But they’ve all been boring battles. I didn’t break a sweat beating them. ...Sigh... I’m Volkner, the Gym Leader. They say I’m the top Gym Leader in Sinnoh, but... Anyway, I guess we’d better get this done. I hope you’re the Trainer who’ll make me remember how fun it is to battle! 
...Hehehe. Hahahah! ...That was the most fun I’ve had in a battle since...I don’t know when! It’s also made me excited to know you and your team will keep battling to greater heights! This is your eighth Gym Badge. You’ve earned this! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Beacon Badge from Volkner.
That Beacon Badge lets you use the hidden move Waterfall even when you’re not in a battle. Waterfall happens to be key if you’re going to the Pokémon League. Also, because you’ve collected all eight Badges, any Pokémon at any level will now obey you without fail. I want you to take this, too. 
What’s inside that [VAR(264, 0, 0)] is the move [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. It may raise Special Attack if it lands. It’s electrifying!
Your next step is the Pokémon League challenge. It’s time for you to cross the sea and win your way through the gauntlet that is Victory Road. Demonstrate to the Pokémon League your mastery of your team. Against you, even the Elite Four will be pushed to fend off your challenge!

Wow! You’re awesomely cool! You have all eight Gym Badges! Now, you have to challenge the Pokémon League!
To make up for the lack of space, the city built roads out of solar panels. Those solar panels provide us with clean energy, and they’re good roads. It’s a symbol of Sunyshore’s will to survive, I think.

I’m going to go that far away with my Pokémon one day!

That glaringly bright and cool thing you have! It’s undoubtedly a Pokétch! They’re awesome, yeah? I got OK’d by the Pokétch Company to develop original Pokétch apps. Hey, you’re a Trainer, right? Can you do me a favor? You’ve got Pokémon with different natures, right? May I see them?
What am I in the mood to see now... I’d like to see a Pokémon with a Serious nature.
What am I in the mood to see now... I’d like to see a Pokémon with a Naive nature.
What am I in the mood to see now... I’d like to see a Pokémon with a Quirky nature.

Only the chosen may enter the Snowpoint Temple. I’m sorry, but you will have to leave. 
Only the chosen may enter the Snowpoint Temple. I’m sorry, but you will have to leave.
The temple is said to have been built in ancient times. It pays homage to the Pokémon of rock, ice, and steel that shape the land. So it is told.
Candice: It’s OK! You can let that person in. 
I heard from Cynthia. You’re working on a Pokédex, aren’t you? There should be many rare Pokémon in the temple. Enjoy your exploring!
Brrr... This snowbound town is always freezing cold. But the spirits of the Trainers and their Pokémon burn hot and bright. Especially the Gym Leader.
Your scarf looks nice and warm. I wish I had one like it.
I want to take a look around in the Snowpoint Temple. But only really tough Trainers are allowed inside.
Pokémon are said to have dragged Snowpoint City here. The Snowpoint Temple is their resting place, they say.
Candice is teaching me about Pokémon. She says I have to start by making friends with Pokémon.
What is it? Do you want to sail to the Battle Zone?
Aye, aye, then! Let’s set sail! 
What is it? The Battle Zone’s rough to get to. The sea around it is always roiling with choppy waves. You can’t go there using Surf, that’s for sure.
A great Trainer recognized by the Pokémon League... I look forward to carrying someone like that on this ship!
There is nothing exceptional here. That makes Snowpoint unique. There’s nothing exceptional about me. That’s what makes me stand out!
Cynthia: I thought you would come. I’m glad I waited for you! 
Cynthia: I think it’s good that our world is constantly changing. Of course, I don’t want it to become what only one person wants. A world like Cyrus envisions... No one would want that. The kind of world I want to see is where everyone can share their joy. Where Pokémon and the people around them can be happy for each other. I want the world to become a place where everyone is smiling. The world could be so much better if we all tried to make it that way. 
I want you to keep traveling to many far-off places. I want you to keep meeting all kinds of people and Pokémon. I came all the way here just so I could say that to you. Your horizons will expand again if you visit the Fight Area as well. I hope our paths cross again!

I’m using Technical Machines to teach moves to my Pokémon. I’m trying for different mixes of moves in different types. It’s for when I go up against the Elite Four of the Pokémon League. They say the Elite Four are tougher than any Gym Leader by far.
If your Pokémon gets frozen, it will thaw out after a while. But if I were you, I’d keep some Ice Heals around.

You want to challenge Candice? Sure thing! I was waiting for someone tough! But I should tell you, I’m tough because I know how to focus. Pokémon, fashion, romance... It’s all about focus! I’ll show you just what I mean. Get ready to lose! 
Wow! You’re great! You’ve earned my respect! I think your focus and will bowled us over totally. Oh, that’s right! I’m supposed to give you this! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Icicle Badge from Candice.
That Icicle Badge I just gave you? Because you have it, you can use the hidden move Rock Climb anytime, even when you’re not in a battle. Oh, and take this, too. 
[VAR(264, 0, 0)] contains the move [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. If the user takes damage, the move’s power is doubled! Can you imagine what sort of focus you’d need to pull it off?
Do you think I should try to act more like an Ice-type Gym Leader? Like, do you think I should be more cool and distant? That sort of thing I have trouble with.
Hey, there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? Do you see the big snowballs placed here and there? You need to slide on the ice with enough momentum to crush them. The Gym Leader is a user of Ice-type Pokémon. Melt her defenses with scorching- hot Fire-type moves! It’s all about focus with this Gym. Bear down and focus!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve beaten the Gym Leader! You were more focused than her, and your Pokémon picked up on it!

Maylene: Brrr... Oh, hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Are you taking the Gym challenge now? I’m hoping to see Candice soon, but I’m staying put until I warm up again first. Oh, you should know that Candice is a user of Ice-type Pokémon. I really admire Candice. She’s so studious. She wanted to practice against me to learn about the Fighting type. It’s because the Ice type matches up badly against the Fighting type. 
Maylene: Oh! That’s the Icicle Badge! You must have beaten Candice. With that Badge, aren’t you allowed to use the hidden move Rock Climb? Rock Climb can be learned by Rock-type or Fighting-type Pokémon, I think.
You know how there are many Ice-type Pokémon around Snowpoint City? I wonder if they also live in the temple?
Sound gets swallowed up by the snow. That’s why it’s very quiet here.
PSYDUCK: Gaga guwawa!
Thank you for coming to Grace’s live show in Snowpoint! I’m so happy you came to see me! I’ll battle you as my thank-you!
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me! 
But my song! It’s nicer than that Crasher Wake’s!
My dream is to be the top Idol! To win everyone’s heart, I’ll sing my heart out in snowy Snowpoint! ...To a crowd of none. ...This is Grace. Thanks for listening...

I love how my girl has so much vivacity and charm.
Thanks to you, my girl’s been in a really happy mood.
By any chance, do you have a Pokémon called MEDICHAM? If you do, would you like to trade your MEDICHAM for my HAUNTER?
Haha! Did my HAUNTER turn into something else? Just kidding! I made it hold something that prevents it from evolving. Please treat my HAUNTER nicely! I’ll be good to your MEDICHAM, too!
What I asked for was a MEDICHAM...?
It’s OK if you don’t want to. But if you change your mind, let’s trade Pokémon.
Thanks to Pokémon, we got to be friends, didn’t we?

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Hold it! Don’t go off without me! You’re challenging the Pokémon League, aren’t you? That’s why I’m here, too. Let’s see who’s more worthy of making the challenge with a battle! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: I guess I’m not ready for the Pokémon League if I’m losing to you! Darn it! You watch, though! I’ll get tougher and win my way through the Pokémon League! Because I’m going to become the Champion, the toughest Trainer! [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! You’d better not lose to anyone before me! 
Let me confirm that you are qualified to challenge the Pokémon League. So! Let us examine the Gym Badges you gathered from Sinnoh. Oreburgh City’s Coal Badge! Eterna City’s Forest Badge! Hearthome City’s Relic Badge! Veilstone City’s Cobble Badge! Pastoria City’s Fen Badge! Canalave City’s Mine Badge! Snowpoint City’s Icicle Badge! And... Sunyshore City’s Beacon Badge! 
Very well! Trainer, you’ve indeed collected all the Gym Badges of Sinnoh! Demonstrate the power that brought you here and go for glory!
You will be facing the Elite Four of the Pokémon League. If you can’t beat all four of them in a row, you have to start from the first one again.
It doesn’t matter if the going is slow. Nor does it matter how many challenges it takes. I’m never giving up! Not until I beat the Elite Four!
What is the Pokémon League? Don’t take my word for it. Take the challenge and experience it for yourself!

Hello! Welcome to the Pokémon League! I’m Aaron of the Elite Four. It’s good to meet you. Oh, I should explain, I’m a huge fan of bug Pokémon. Bug Pokémon are nasty-mean, and yet they’re beautiful, too... Would you like to know why I take on challengers here? It’s because I want to become perfect, just like my bug Pokémon! OK! Let me take you on! 
I lost with the most beautiful and toughest of the bug Pokémon... We lost because I wasn’t good enough... That’s it! Back to training camp! Let’s hear it for me! No... That was wrong... Anyway... Go on to the next room! Three Trainers are waiting for you. They’re all tougher than me.
Go on, go to the next room. I’m going to become a top-level Trainer who can’t be outclassed with my beautiful and tough bug Pokémon!

Well, well. You’re quite the adorable Trainer, but you’ve also got a spine. Ahaha! I’m Bertha. I have a preference for Ground-type Pokémon. Well, would you show this old lady how much you’ve learned? 
You’re quite something, youngster. I like how you and your Pokémon earned the win by working as one. That’s what makes you so strong. Ahahaha! I think that you can go as far as you want.
The Trainer in the next room is a much more formidable opponent. You really must have your wits about you. However, I think you can go as far as you desire. Ahahaha!

Yo, Trainer! You had me counting the days on my fingers waiting for you to come. I heard from Volkner what you  did in Sunyshore. You managed to light a fire in that guy’s heart again. How could you not expect me to look forward to seeing you in battle? 
You’re facing a Fire-type Pokémon user with me. Let Flint see how hot your spirit burns! 
... ... ... ... ... ... ...Whew... ...Burnt right down to cinders...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...Keep going...
I was waiting for you, challenger! Flint, the master of the Fire type, is up next! Battles are clashes of the burning spirit of Pokémon. Battles aren’t about appearances or what’s weak or strong. It all comes down to whether the combatants can burn hot or not. 
... ... ...Whew... ...Burnt right down to cinders...
... ... ...Keep going... I know your spirit burns hot. Your whole team does.

Ah, you timed your arrival well. I’ve just finished reading a book, you see. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lucian. I am a user of the Psychic type. I must say, you’ve already proven yourself to be outstanding by coming this far. They say I am the toughest of the Elite Four. I’m afraid I will have to go all out against you to live up to that reputation. 
Congratulations. You’ve now beaten the Elite Four. However, that doesn’t mean you’re done with the Pokémon League. There remains the Champion. I should warn you--the Champion is far stronger than the Elite Four. Now, go on. Step through the doorway to your final battle.
I’ll be reading books until the next challenger arrives. That will calm my nerves, so that I may deal with all situations without panicking.

Together, you and your Pokémon overcame all the challenges you faced, however difficult. It means that you’ve triumphed over any personal weaknesses, too. The power you learned... I can feel it emanating from you. But that’s enough talk. Let’s get on with why you’re here. As the Pokémon League Champion, I accept your challenge! 
Cynthia: That was excellent. Truly, an outstanding battle. You gave the support your Pokémon needed to maximize their power. And you guided them with certainty to secure victory. You have both passion and calculating coolness. Together, you and your Pokémon  can overcome any challenge that may come your way. Those are the impressions I got from our battle. I’m glad I got to take part in the crowning of Sinnoh’s new Champion!

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], I tried to get into the Battle Frontier, which happens to be right here. Then these guys came along and got in my face about it. Like, they’re saying they want to test me if I’m good enough and all that. Like, as if I need to prove anything. So, let’s team up. Like we did at the Spear Pillar. Let’s show those guys how good we are!

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Come on, let’s show them how tough we really are!
Flint: Yo, Trainer! It’s been too long, amigo! Now I don’t know what your pal speedy there’s been spouting... But we’re not doing this out of spite or anything bad natured like that. The Battle Frontier behind us is where the best Trainers gather. We’re being kind enough to let you see if you’re up to the challenge! You really ought to be grateful!
Volkner: You only want to go into the Frontier, don’t you? I’m sorry about my friend. He’s off on his own thing...
Flint: This situation just cooks! The drama and tension sizzles! Flint, the fiery master of fire Pokémon, is going to put you to the test! Let Flint see how hot your spirit burns! 
Volkner: I don’t know how I managed to get myself into this, but... Show me the skills that got you through the Pokémon League! 
Flint: ... ... ... ... ... ... 
Volkner: Hey! Don’t burn out on us! Now you’re just getting in the way. 
Volkner: Hahaha! That was a blast! Our combination came up short, but you’re also a lot tougher as well. Promise me we’ll do this again. I’ll see to taking this husk home.

Palmer: Huh? Ah! If it isn’t [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve grown all sturdy! And [VAR(259, 1, 0)], too! I haven’t seen you in a long time, either! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], your mother told me you’d gone off to the Battle Zone. So I had to come running looking for you. So, are you two going to take the Battle Frontier challenge? The Frontier has five facilities that are all dedicated to battling. Each one has a unique set of rules, so they’re all different. Of course, you have to be good to win at any of them. Anyway, I’m satisfied to see that you’re both doing well. I’ll go back to my usual place in the Battle Tower. I’ll be looking forward to your challenge. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: My dad is cool, huh? I mean, when it gets right down to it. You think so too, right? He’s a Frontier Brain, after all. He’s the Tower Tycoon! I want to be cool like my dad! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], that’s the one reason I decided to become a Trainer! 
Ooh, what am I going to do? Should I make the challenge now? Or do I train some more? 
OK! I’ve decided! I’m going to get tougher! By a lot! I finally made it here! There’s no need for haste now. 
Who are you guys? What makes an Elite Four and a Gym Leader want to take you on?
Hey, hey. I just watched you two battle. You’re something special, aren’t you? Beating an Elite Four like that. Oh, right, howdy. The name’s Buck. I’m usually training at the Survival Area or Stark Mountain. You should come up there. You’ll get toughened up for sure! 
Anyways, howdy, I’m Buck. Sheesh, that punk can’t beat me. So, do you know that zippity-doodah of a Trainer? You should chase after that guy and tell him not to underestimate the volcano. Oh, but you know what? You’d better shape up at the Battle Tower first, too. I don’t like your chances of getting to the volcano, otherwise. Be seeing you! 
You can learn a lot by watching other Trainers battle. I can’t wait to cast my eyes on a battle with an Elite Four and a Gym Leader!
I can’t believe I’m going to see a battle involving the best Trainers! That’s what I get for living right in front of the Frontier. I must be lucky!
There’s a lot to think about in any two-on-two battle. It puts the focus on the Trainer’s knowledge and skills.
Are Volkner and Flint really good friends? I’ve heard all they ever do is argue and bicker.
An Elite Four and a Gym Leader... That combination’s intriguing!
Howdy, Trainer! You have a Pokédex, do you? The person who gave you that must be waiting for you to fill it completely.
Howdy, Trainer! Have you been to the Battle Frontier? It’s a good place to learn about the intricacies of battling. Like how certain Pokémon can battle with certain moves and so on.
The way the Battle Tower looms... It really is a wall that stands before every Trainer.
                                             
I’ve battled many Trainers over the years. I’ve gained some confidence in my skill levels, too. But the world is still a huge place. It’s not easy to win in life!
Because of the volcano, the land around here is craggy. The rough terrain and all the ups and downs make it hard to hike.
The Pokémon League’s Elite Four come here sometimes!
Your Pokémon are from Sinnoh, aren’t they? They’re not what we’re used to seeing around here.
There’s no end to becoming tough! I just made that up, but it sounds kind of cool, huh?
What’s up? Do you want to sail to Snowpoint City?
Aye, right! It’s anchors aweigh, then! 
Oh, right. You’d rather just fly everywhere in some big hurry.
Whenever I go to a new place, I get excited over what I might discover. But places I’ve visited before... Even those places thrill me with new discoveries!
Hmm! A Super Rod is really good! Wouldn’t you agree?
Hmm! We’re of identical minds! Hmm! Take this [VAR(264, 0, 0)]!

What items should Pokémon hold? It’s an important question. Here’s something else to think about.

To the north is the Survival Area and then Stark Mountain. The road there is too tough for me to travel, though.
Are you stocked up on Poké Balls? In the tall grass past here, you’ll find interesting Pokémon. Like, Pokémon you never see anywhere else in Sinnoh!

Even from here, we could see the peak of Mt. Coronet. Most people didn’t notice what happened up there, but I did. But I don’t know what took place exactly, or anything like that.
Everyone’s fanatical about battling here.
People are people, and I’m me. I don’t like to be compared. But comparing with other people reveals things about yourself sometimes, too. That’s why you should check out the Global Terminal in Jubilife City.

The Battle Zone used to attract only the hardiest of the Trainers. They were considered eccentric for gathering at a place like this. It’s hard to believe how much it’s changed since then. Places like the Fight Area and the Survival Area just seemed to spring up overnight.
He was one of those early eccentrics who were around during the early days of the Battle Zone. Well, I was too.
TORCHIC: Chiic chic!
I am the Item Expert! I have mastery in the way of items! Your Pokémon... Do they hold items? The better the item they hold, the  stronger they become. There are items that are worthy of my recommendation. Care to know? 
Which item would you like me to describe?
There’s a great variety of other items, of course. The kinds of items to be held will also depend on your battle strategy. All I can say in conclusion is that you’ll never know until you try!
Lum Berry! When held by a Pokémon, it instantly heals status problems. Like sleep, paralysis, confusion, that sort of thing. It’s a berry, though, so it’s gone if it’s used. 
Focus Sash! This hold item will prevent a Pokémon with full HP from a one-hit KO. The holding Pokémon will survive an attack like that leaving just one HP. Being able to get one turn in has huge implications for battle strategists! 
Expert Belt! This hold item boosts the power of a super-effective move to 120%. It’d be useful for a Pokémon that knows different types of moves. 
Life Orb! This hold item boosts the power of all the Pokémon’s moves to 130%! However! It also takes 10% of the holder’s HP every time a move is used. 
Choice Scarf! This hold item boosts the Speed of the Pokémon to 150%! However, and beware of this, it will only allow one move to be used. 
Choice Band! This hold item boosts the Attack stat of the Pokémon to 150%. Beware, it has no effect on the Special Attack stat. Make no mistake of it. 
Choice Specs! This hold item boosts the Special Attack stat of the Pokémon to 150%. Beware, it has no effect on the Attack stat. Make no mistake of it. 
Leftovers! At the end of a turn, after both sides have made their moves, this hold item restores HP by about 6%. The recovered HP could well be the difference in a tight battle.

Darach: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], congratulations! You are to be commended on your mastery for keeping the streak alive. Our owner, recognizing your worth, demands you battle the Castle Valet. You are prepared, yes? 
Darach: Welcome. I am Darach, as you know, and I am the Castle Valet. Lady Caitlin, my employer, is not one to accept defeat willingly. However, for a reason I’m not at liberty to disclose, she cannot battle. Consequently, I will do battle in her ladyship’s place. ...Let me assure you that you won’t be shortchanged by facing me. En garde! 
Darach: Your mastery of Pokémon is as breathtaking as ever. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you certainly are to be commended. ...However, if I may say so, I noticed something about the way you battle. After all, I have had the opportunity to watch you closely firsthand. So, what is it that I noticed? As a Trainer myself, it is but proper etiquette to show you in a battle. Let us begin! En garde! 
Darach: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you are truly in possession of a superlative talent! I drew on every reserve of experience and etiquette handed down through our heritage of glorious servitude. But even then, I failed to fend off your inspired and inspiring challenge. I shall see to appeasing Lady Caitlin’s displeasure at my loss. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], please do return to our Battle Castle. We will be delighted and honored to have you back! 
Darach: I am humbled... What I’d perceived to be a weakness was only illusory... Or, perhaps you corrected it in the course of our battle. Regardless, your performance was stunning again. Though she cannot say it, Lady Caitlin appears quite taken by your style. For her sake at the very least, please do return to our Battle Castle!

Hi, can we feature you in a news piece we’re doing? All you have to do is battle with me. Will you do that?
Reporter Kinsey’s live interview! 
Unbelievable! Press coverage denied! I find you intriguing, too...
To get people to open up, we approach them honestly with no hidden tricks. It’s like the relationship between Pokémon and Trainers, isn’t it?
I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! Is it OK to go for the scoop?
As a professional cameraman, I always go for the best shot! 
That’s a downer... I thought I’d found a Trainer and Pokémon who’d shine on camera.
The lively expressions on you and your Pokémon’s faces... It sure makes for some great TV!
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am! Aren’t you having fun?! Let’s make it fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this? Shall we do something fantastical? 
Oh, how shall I say this...? It makes me all lonely, I say...
A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while laughing. Mwahahah! It defines what we do!
Come on, let’s show off our Pokémon! Let’s do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit’s vibes... You’ve got rock in your veins! 
My guitar... It lies broken and weeping...
Pokémon and rock and roll are all anyone needs to survive this world!
Hi, I’m Grace, the Idol! I’m just back from a show in Oreburgh Mine! So, shall we battle?
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me! 
You won’t accept my challenge?! But I’m an Idol...
Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! I hope you’ll support us! Just so you know, our latest single is titled “Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”!
Two Pokémon! That’s what we need. We’re looking for a Trainer who’s traveling with at least two Pokémon.
Oh! Would you like to battle against the both of us?
You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK? 
OK, that’s how it is, huh. Can’t do anything about that.
Whee! Wasn’t that battle smoking hot? You should make a Battle Video of it and share it with the world!
Oh, dear! You only have one Pokémon with you? That’s very commendable, but we can’t battle with you that way.
Giggle! Could you win against both of us?
We’ll thoroughly check out your abilities as a Trainer! 
Oh? You haven’t healed your Pokémon, maybe?
That was a good match. It adds flair and drama when many eager Pokémon get involved.
We’re doing a news piece on Trainers. Can we get you to participate? If we can, we’d like to see how strong you are in a battle!
Jubilife TV! On-the-spot live report! 
...Are you one of those contrary people who reply “No” first thing?
Why Trainers choose certain kinds of Pokémon and their feelings about it... That’s what we’re investigating.
I felt a flash of inspiration when I laid eyes on you. I’d really love to capture you on camera while you’re battling.
For close-ups, I need to get in tight. You don’t mind, do you? 
That’s a downer... I thought I’d found a Trainer and Pokémon who’d shine on camera.
So, did you come to Hearthome to compete in Contests?
Would you like to battle with me? As a memento of your visit to Pastoria?
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me! 
You’re not interested in Idols? ...I think I’m going to cry.
Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! I hope you’ll support us! Just so you know, our latest single is titled “Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”!
Are we all ready to have some fun? Our battle will be fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this? Shall we do something fantastical? 
Oh, how shall I say this...? It makes me all lonely, I say...
Well, let’s see! Which town will we go to next?
Come on, let’s show off our Pokémon! Let’s do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit’s vibes... You’ve got rock in your veins! 
My guitar... It lies broken and weeping...
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit, too! That’s why a battle is rock!
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d get a great shot here.
Oh! You’re ready for a battle with us?
You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK? 
OK, that’s how it is, huh. Can’t do anything about that.
I’d like to take that footage and broadcast it worldwide.
Oh, no. What we really want to see is you battling using two Pokémon!
Giggle! Will you have a battle with us?
We’ll thoroughly check out your abilities as a Trainer! 
Oh, too bad! I wanted to check out your Pokémon!
I lost but I’m totally thrilled! We made a wonderful spectacle!
Do you want to hear me play my guitar? Or do we battle?
Your spirit’s vibes... You’ve got rock in your veins! 
My guitar... It lies broken and weeping...
For Trainers, Pokémon! For my girl, sweet kisses! That’s the perfect world for this guitarist!
Thank you for coming to Grace’s live show in Snowpoint! I’m so happy you came to see me! I’ll battle you as my thank-you!
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me! 
But my song! It’s nicer than that Crasher Wake’s!
My dream is to be the top Idol! To win everyone’s heart, I’ll sing my heart out in snowy Snowpoint! ...To a crowd of none. ...This is Grace. Thanks for listening...
We’re doing a feature on tough Trainers in the Battle Zone. That’s where you come in. We need you to battle us!
Reporter Kinsey’s live interview! 
You don’t have to be shy. We can obscure your face if we have to.
I go after interviews like my favorite Pokémon move--I tackle them! Of course, I don’t use Tackle in battles, though.
Expert Trainer spotted! Will you let us battle with you?
Great! Great! You guys are great! 
Want to see how good you are before you go off to the Battle Frontier?
The combination of you and your Pokémon will tear up the Battle Tower!
Po-Po-Pokémon! I want to become more like a PIKACHU! Will you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu! 
Pi-Pikachu!
I can make static electricity, but I’m not very much like a Pokémon yet. Don’t give up, me! Become a Pokémon, me!
Pikachu! I want to become more like a PIKACHU! Will you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu! 
Pi-Pikachu!
I need to find a way to get more into the character of a Pokémon... Maybe I should get the Day Care to raise me?
As a clown, I like to show off Pokémon that are a little out of the ordinary. Want to battle and see for yourself?
OK, how shall we do this? Shall we do something fantastical? 
Oh, how shall I say this...? It makes me all lonely, I say...
Here’s a piece of useless trivia. Fear of clowns is also known as coulrophobia!
Po-Po-Pokémon! I want to become more like a PIKACHU! Will you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu! 
Pi-Pikachu!
But I just had my team pampered at the Ribbon Syndicate! I have to get more into the character of a Pokémon...

Mom: Oh, good! You and your Pokémon are looking great. Oh, yes, I heard from Professor Rowan. He said that a Pokémon’s energy is measured in HP (Hit Points). If your Pokémon lose their HP, you can restore it at any Pokémon Center. If you’re going to travel far away, the smart Trainer stocks up on Potions at the Pokémon Mart. Make me proud, honey! Take care!
Mom: Oh, good! You and your Pokémon are looking great. Oh yes, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your Pokémon will faint if it runs out of HP. If your Pokémon loses its HP, come home before it faints. It will be healed to full health by taking a rest. Well, honey, make me proud! Take care!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Your Pokémon have been healed to perfect health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center when your Pokémon’s HP goes down. If you’re planning to travel any distance, you should stock up on Potions at a Pokémon Mart. Good luck, Trainer!

Welcome to the Contest Hall. I can help you with registering for a Super Contest. 
Would you like to enter a Pokémon in a Contest?

Welcome to the Contest Hall! This is the reception counter for linked Super Contests. You may join a group of friends to enter your Pokémon in the same Super Contest over a link.

We look forward to your participation another time!
Would you like to enter a link Contest?
Two to four players may compete using wireless communications. First, choose the Contest you wish to enter. Next, make sure the other people in your group choose the same Contest. Then, the players each choose a Pokémon to enter the Contest, and that’s it for registration! After that, the Contest starts in the usual way. We hope you’ll try it out. 
A Pokémon Super Contest involves four Trainers. Each one enters a Pokémon to compete against the others. Judging is conducted in three categories: Visual, Dance, and Acting. The Pokémon scoring the highest in the three categories is the winner. If this is your first time, it is recommended you try some practice sessions before entering a Contest. The registration counter for practice sessions is at the far right. 
In the Visual Competition, Pokémon are rated on their appearance. Scoring is based on votes cast by the audience. For details, please inquire at the practice counter on the right. 
In the Dance Competition, the Pokémon will get to show off their footwork. Try to put on coordinated dance performances with everyone! For details, please inquire at the practice counter on the right. 
In the Acting Competition, the Pokémon will perform their moves in front of Judges. Try to get your Pokémon to put on performances that stand out from the rest of the pack! For details, please inquire at the practice counter on the right. 
There are five Contests in all: Cool, Beauty, Cute, Smart, and Tough. Be sure to choose the Contest that best suits the Pokémon you want to enter with. 
There are four different ranks to the Pokémon Super Contests. The four ranks are Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master. The Normal Rank is open for entry by any Pokémon. A Pokémon winning a Normal Rank Contest may move up to the Great Rank in the same category. Likewise, win a Great Contest and become eligible for the Ultra Rank. An Ultra Rank winner may move up to the Master Rank in the same way. A Master Rank winner may enter Master Rank Contests as often as the Trainer wishes. 
Which Pokémon would you like to enter? 
Please choose a Pokémon. 
OK! Your Pokémon has been accepted for entry! Your entry number is [VAR(306, 0, 0)]! 
We look forward to your participation another time!

DRESS-UP POINTS
    
CANCEL
Judging here is based on the visual appeal of Pokémon. Scoring is based on voting by the audience. The more popular the Pokémon, the higher its score! The Pokémon are scored in two categories: Condition Points and Dress-Up Points. 
Condition Points are scored on the Pokémon’s condition in one of five categories. The five conditions are: Cool, Beauty, Cute, Smart, and Tough. These conditions can be enhanced by feeding Poffins to your Pokémon. If the audience likes what they see, [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks will appear. Obviously, the more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks there are, the more popular the Pokémon. 
Dress-Up Points are awarded for fashionably dressing up your Pokémon with Accessories. Before you begin, you will be given a fashion theme. Your dressed-up Pokémon will be scored on how well it matches the assigned theme. The audience’s approval will appear as pink [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks. Be sure to position the Accessories properly and attach them firmly. They won’t stay on otherwise. There is a time limit of 60 seconds. Get your Pokémon dressed up within that time.

BACKUP DANCER
MAIN DANCER

CANCEL
In a Dance Competition, the four contestants take on different parts. One becomes the main dancer, and the remaining three are backup dancers. The main dancer scores points by performing inspired dance steps that the others can’t copy. The backup dancers earn high scores by duplicating the dance steps laid down by the main dancer. 
Your Pokémon will first appear as a backup dancer. Make it dance using the same timing as the main dancer. Use the castanets to show your Pokémon which direction the main dancer turned. 
The main dancer rotates with a backup dancer so everyone gets a turn. When your Pokémon is the main dancer, show it how to dance! 
The melody will be shown playing on the red and blue panels. The panel colors show who should be dancing. The main dancer can dance while the melody is in the blue panels. Backup dancers must dance only during the red panels. The dancers must perform the required number of dance steps during their time slots. 
We look forward to your next visit!

JUDGES

In the Acting Competition, four Pokémon will perform their moves for our panel of Judges. The more a Pokémon stands out, the higher it scores. Each Pokémon will get the chance to perform four times. 
Every move has one or more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks that indicate the acting score. The more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks obtained, the higher the Pokémon scores. However, Pokémon are not permitted to perform the same move two turns in a row. 
There are three Judges in all. You get to choose which one you want to judge your Pokémon. Try not to have your Pokémon scored by the same Judge as other Pokémon so it can stand out more. If your Pokémon leaves a strong impression, it will be rated highly, earning it more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks. 
Voltage shows the excitement level of the Judges. In a Cool Contest, if a Pokémon uses a Cool move, Voltage goes up. However, if a Cute or Smart move is performed, the Voltage goes down. If the Voltage reaches 5 points, the Pokémon earns bonus points. If the Special Judge in the center was chosen, 8 bonus points are awarded when the Voltage peaks. For the other Judges, 5 bonus points are awarded.

Everyone that works in the coal mine keeps their own Pokémon with them. You may be challenged to battles! Hahaha!
I found what I thought were some rocks, then they started moving! They were Pokémon that looked just like rocks!
Hello! How do you do! I’m a student of philosophy. If I had to explain very simply, I study how people came to be. That could explain why I happen to be in Sinnoh. In Sinnoh, there is a myth on how the world came into existence. Investigating that myth may give me insight on the emergence of people. I found something very interesting soon after arrival. You may have it, if you’d like. 
Oh? You have an overabundance of things! I’ll wait for you with this.
Well, hello! About that very interesting thing I found... You may have it, if you’d like. 
I’m told that Plate was created at the same time as Sinnoh. That Plate I found bears this inscription. “The rightful bearer of a Plate draws from the Plate it holds.” The rightful bearer, I think, may point to the shaper of this world. Oh, by the way, I’m only interested in the words and thoughts left behind. Physical artifacts like that Plate don’t interest me once I’ve read them. I hope we meet again somewhere.

OK, stand back and watch this. Using the hidden move Rock Smash, a boulder blocking your way... 
Fallen boulders need to be smashed so they’re out of the way. If you could get the Badge from the Gym in town, you’d be able to do this too. Of course, you’d have to beat the Gym Leader first. That’d be me!

Don’t you dare go into the Valley Windworks. I got ordered to keep everyone out if they’re not part of Team Galactic. You’re giving me a look that makes me think you’re gonna try to get in. OK, then. You’ll have to battle me for it! 
Isn’t that just great. Getting owned by some kid. But you can’t do a thing if I lock myself in with my Works Key! That’s right, the other Works Key’s not here! My cohorts in the flower patch have the only other one! Hahaha! In that sense, I’m no longer the loser! 
Looker: Ah, yes. It is you, yes. I have heard that the Team Galactic appeared at this power plant. I have, therefore, come running. So, the Team Galactic. Where are they? ... You have run them off, you say? You are a Trainer, but...? Very well! I shall go investigate inside! 
Looker: Magnificent! Yes, it is! What you have said, it is all true! Superb! Though you are young, you are a Trainer through and through! Very well! I shall pursue the culprits! I have received tips that the Team Galactic hideout is in Eterna City. To there, I must be off! 
Ker-chunk! 
It’s locked from inside!
It’s locked from inside! Use the Works Key?
Ker-chunk! The door to Valley Windworks opened!

What?! No way! You have the key? Locking the door was meaningless! I am the loser in this after all! This is no time for self-pity! I’ve got to alert the Commander! 
My Pokémon can’t battle anymore. They’re gonna take away my Pokémon for messing this one up... Humph! Just you wait! Our Commander will smoosh you!
I’m one of Team Galactic’s three Commanders. ...No, wait. That’s one of four Commanders. My name is Mars! We’ve been trying to create a new world that’s better than this one... But people have shown little understanding about what we do. You don’t understand either, do you? It’s a little saddening... So, let’s have a battle to decide what we should do next. If I win, you leave. If you win, we, Team Galactic, will leave! 
Mars: Oops! I messed that one up! That’s all right, though. I quite enjoyed our battle. 
Charon: My, my. Lose to a child, will you? But, no matter. We’ve collected plenty of electricity. With the power we obtained, we can do something quite spectacular. It seems quite obvious to me, Charon, the genius even the boss recognizes. Now, Mars, we should be going. 
Mars: Will you shut it! The boss is the only person in the world who’s allowed to order me around! You can keep quiet around me! You only joined us recently. Don’t think you’re important! 
I guess it’s time to say good-bye and leave for the time being! 
Team Galactic... They were saying they had to gather Pokémon and energy no matter what. It was for creating a new universe, or so they claimed. Nothing they said made any sort of sense to me. I can’t tell you how grateful I am for you saving me. I can finally see my little daughter again! 
Little girl: Papa! Yuck! Papa, you’re stinky! Go shower now, stinky! 
Papa: Oh, sorry! Ahaha! They had me working nonstop! 
Little girl: Thank you, Trainer! You made those bad people go away! I think the balloon Pokémon will come visiting again!
Papa: Oh, yes, a balloon Pokémon appears in front of the windworks. It’s always a certain day of the week, but I’m not sure which day. Could its appearance have something to do with this windworks using wind-generated energy?
The Valley Windworks uses turbines to capture energy from winds driven from the mountains in this canyon. We produce energy from the power of nature itself. It’s quite wonderful.
If the balloon Pokémon came, the wind would blow it away!
The bringer of wars... Your target is the energy of the power plant. The bringer of contentment... Your target is the Pokémon statue of Eterna City. The bringer of aging... Your target is the Pokémon that sleeps on today. The dream energy.            Team Galactic

Hello, my name’s Cheryl. And you are...? OK, so your name is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I’m sincerely glad to meet you. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], may I ask a big favor of you? I want to get through this forest, but I’m afraid of doing it alone. I’ve heard that there is a sinister group of people called Team Galactic about. I think there’d be safety in numbers. Please, may I go through with you? 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] decided to go with Cheryl!

Cheryl: Oh! There’s the exit! I’m so relieved... We finally got here. I would’ve never been able to get through this by myself. Thank you so much, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! 
This is my token of appreciation. Please accept it! 
I’m sure we’ll meet again somewhere! Bye for now! 
Cheryl: There is an Old Chateau ahead. No one lives there now. They say it’s haunted.
I’m searching for bug Pokémon so I can win at the Eterna Gym. Bug Pokémon are great, you know? They grow really fast!
The rock is covered in moss. It feels pleasantly cool.
Gardenia: Hiya! Were you intrigued by the rumors going around, too? 
You know, people’ve been talking about the ghost Pokémon of the Old Chateau. I’ve been hearing rumors about sinister shadows, too. 
I should check it out myself, but going in there is... ...Well, you know, being that I’m a Gym Leader, I’m always busy. So, since I’m so busy, I can’t go in. It’s not because I’m s-scared! S-so, good luck with your investigation!

Mr. Fuego: Well, hello! It’s not often I get a visitor here. I tried to make the ironworks run better with the moving floor tiles. But no one was happy about it! They said the moving floor made them dizzy! But you don’t want to listen to me whine. Here’s a souvenir! 
Mr. Fuego: My ironworks makes iron by removing impurities from iron ore. In the process, we find a variety of colored Shards. If you’d like, we can trade Star Pieces for these Shards.

Mr. Fuego: Are you interested? Want to trade Star Pieces for Shards?
Mr. Fuego: I see you’ve got many Star Pieces. Would you like to trade ten of them?
Mr. Fuego: There you are-- red, blue, yellow, and green. Shards in different colors! 
Mr. Fuego: You’re not trading?!
Mr. Fuego: My ironworks would be nothing if there were no iron. That’s why I’m always thankful for nature supplying me with iron.

According to one theory, Mt. Coronet is where the Sinnoh region began. 
...In a newly created world... A world where only time flowed and space expanded... There should have been no strife. 
But what became of that world? Because the human spirit is weak and incomplete, strife has spread... This world is being ruined by it... I find this state of affairs to be deplorable...

Looker: Observe, if you will, that hole. There was once a cave painting that had blocked the way to the summit. But the wall, it is no longer there. It lies in pieces. Do you see? Ever since the three Pokémon of the lakes have been captured... Something terrible is happening, but what exactly, I do not know. 
There is but one cause! Team Galactic’s Cyrus! And now, we are all caught up. Now, to the next step. Are you Trainer enough to advance? Show me, if you will! 
... ... Hahaha! You can relax now. You see, I understand. You are far superior to me. As are the Commanders. Cyrus, too, naturally. Team Galactic is beyond my reach... Please, you must stop them! For only you are able! All I can do now is give you this. It is a little something I obtained in an investigation long ago. 
Looker: Please! You must stop Team Galactic!
Your Bag, it is full? Are you prepared for every occasion?
Looker: Please, stop Team Galactic! For only you are able! All I can do now is give you this. It is a little something I obtained in an investigation long ago.

Grunt 1: The fog is so thick ahead I can’t even see my own hand! Can you use Defog so we can see? 
Grunt 2: Hah? The Pokémon they gave me can’t use Defog, either. I think we’re stuck. Let’s wait till the others get here.

Cyrus: ... ... Everything is ready for the creation of a new world. Now, all will end. And everything will begin. With this, the Red Chain made from the crystals of the three lake Pokémon... And this, the Red Chain I replicated with technological means... With these Red Chains I will pry open the portal to another dimension. I command that you unleash your power for me... 
DIALGA, the mythical Pokémon, and the master of time! 
                 
...And the other. PALKIA, the mythical Pokémon, and the master of space and dimensions! 
              
Cyrus: I’ve waited so long for this moment, DIALGA and PALKIA. Shaping this world is a double spiral of time and space. Yes, the very things that you have the ability to control! You will do my bidding! I will have your abilities as mine! With the power I wield, I will create an entirely new world! 
The incomplete and ugly world we have now can disappear. I am resetting everything to zero. Nothing can remain. It is all for making the ultimate world. A world of complete perfection. Nothing so vague and incomplete as spirit can remain. 
Cyrus: ...I should have expected as much. UXIE, “The Being of Knowledge.” AZELF, “The Being of Willpower.” And MESPRIT, “The Being of Emotion”... 
The Pokémon have come to protect Sinnoh? Pathetic and worthless. It takes the three of them, the three lake Pokémon that symbolize spirit, to balance either the Pokémon of time or space. But they can’t maintain balance against the two. Not when both DIALGA and PALKIA are here. Their coming here is in vain. So much meaningless drama. 
Now, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. You’ve constantly interfered with my plans, but you will be forgiven. After all, there will remain no spirit for all time when I am done. All spirit will disappear. It will be ripped away... From you! From your Pokémon! From those precious to you...! It is time! My dream will be my reality! 
What is this pressure I feel...? Something...is enraged? 
Cyrus: Interesting. So, there is a Pokémon that can only appear as a shadow. 
Regardless, the effort is rash and foolish. I have harnessed the powers of DIALGA and PALKIA...

Cynthia: I’m sorry I took so long. I think I finally found the answer from studying the myths. When this world was made, DIALGA and PALKIA appeared. Apparently, there was one more Pokémon that appeared at the same time. A Pokémon with as much power as DIALGA and PALKIA... But also one whose name was never to be spoken--GIRATINA! It’s said to lurk in another world... A world on the opposite side of ours... That’s what the shadow was. It must have been GIRATINA. 
The pillars are distorting... It’s because of that portal. It’s joined us to the other world. If it’s not closed, the distortion will spread to Sinnoh and beyond... Our world will be destroyed... 
Cynthia: Are you ready? We have to chase Cyrus!
Cynthia: We have to hurry!

That Hidden Machine, or HM for short, contains the hidden move Rock Smash. A Pokémon learning Rock Smash can smash small boulders in the field.

Ultimately, he destroys his own creation for his ludicrous vision. It’s no thanks to him that I have to struggle with the pieces. 
...But that’s fine. The young can live with their dreams. I prefer to remain firmly in reality. And for that, money is paramount. You there, child. I’m not dealing with you.

Charon: Eh? What’s this, then? Chased me here, have you? I like seeing children try their best, but too bad for you--you’re too late. With this Magma Stone I will let awaken the legendary HEATRAN! I will control the volcano’s eruptions to extort money by the millions! Fear me! For I am Charon! The boss of the reborn Team Galactic! 
???: Go, go, go! 
Charon: No! The Magma Stone! What?! What is going on?! 
???: Excellent work, CROAGUNK! 
Looker: Pah! Disguising myself as a boulder for stakeout was not easy! 
Now, old-timer, the International Police cordially requests your cooperation. I am sure you have much to tell us about the new Team Galactic. With Cyrus, Mars, and Jupiter gone, you are all that is left.

Charon: Gah... What a mess... ...Uh, International Police? What are you saying? I know nothing! A new Team Galactic? Extorting with HEATRAN? Merely the blathering of this harmless old man! All said in jest! Besides, among Team Galactic’s Commanders, I was the most junior... 
Looker: You can tell us all about it. We have plenty of time. Oh, no, no. No resisting arrest. You can’t win three-on-one, no? OK, Officers, over here, if you will.

Riley: This used to be a fairly thriving ore mine once upon a time. I guess the steel ore’s played out. There’s only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron? The Leader of Canalave Gym? He’s asked me to become a Gym Leader, but there’s his son Roark to consider.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like for a Steel-type Pokémon user to battle a Steel type. Would that be like battling yourself, I wonder? I mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat one’s self than anyone else.

Saturn: So, it’s you... I’ve heard about you and what took place at the Spear Pillar. Our leader, Master Cyrus, hated the very idea of spirit. He hated spirit for being incomplete. And yet, using fiery exhortations, he rallied the spirit of others. What he hated most, he used to control others. Isn’t that ironic? That fascinated me. I wanted to see what he would do. And I did. At his side. But it’s over. A world without spirit... Who would want such a thing?! So, what now...? What to do with Team Galactic? But I’ve learned that extremism is never the solution... Perhaps we should really be searching for new sources of energy. Instead of lying about it through our commercials.

Cyrus: ...So, you’ve come. You heard my speech, I take it. Snicker... A big lie, of course. It’s true insofar as my intention is to create a new world. But that world isn’t for the likes of Team Galactic. I seek an entirely new world solely for myself. If not, it could never be the complete and perfect world. You’ve seen my minions of Team Galactic. You yourself must know that they are uniformly useless and incomplete. 
I know why you’re here. I can sense it in you. It’s about UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF, correct? You want to save them... I no longer have any need for them. I am finished with them. If your heart aches to save them, go right ahead. I couldn’t care less. It will save me the trouble of disposing of them. But, I must say... You are a remarkable specimen. Those Pokémon have nothing to do with you, do they? But still you came to rescue them out of pity? Such pitifully useless emotions... It’s illogical and irrational. Pity and compassion are products of the weak and faulty human heart. You were compelled to come here by such vacuous sentimentality! I will make you regret paying heed to your heart! 
Cyrus: I see. You are indeed strong. And the basis of your power is your compassion toward Pokémon. ...How wasteful... Such emotions are but mere illusions. And, like all illusions, they fade over time until death banishes them forever. That is why I have abandoned all emotions as useless sentimentality. ...But that doesn’t matter. I doubt you will ever understand my position. That said, I recognize that you are strong and courageous to come alone. This is your reward. 
Cyrus: The Master Ball is the ultimate Poké Ball. It will unfailingly catch any Pokémon in the wild. But it is not anything that I require. Unlike you Trainers, I do not make Pokémon my friends or partners. Unlike other Team Galactic members, I don’t use Pokémon as tools. Instead, I make the power of Pokémon my own. 
If you wish to save the Pokémon from the lakes, take the warp panel ahead. I am off to Mt. Coronet. I will ascend the mountain to its peak where destiny awaits me. It is there that I will create my new world...

Team Galactic Report 
Which report would you like to read?
Some say the universe originated from a massive explosion. Similarly, Sinnoh is thought to have been formed by an explosion in ancient times. Needless to say, the explosion came from the power of a Pokémon. The Pokémon must have been the mythical creature considered a deity by the ancients. Our aim is not to capture the mythical Pokémon, but to obtain its power... The PC entry ends there... 
The mythical Pokémon... According to myths, the Pokémon created Sinnoh with its power. However, capturing the Pokémon with a Poké Ball prevents it from using its full power... But with the Red Chain, the Pokémon can be shackled, and its power can be used without restraint... The PC entry ends there... 
The Red Chain... The Pokémon of the three lakes and Mt. Coronet are somehow connected. Capturing the Pokémon of the lakes will free the Pokémon of Mt. Coronet. From the Pokémon of the lakes, crystals can be extracted to create a Red Chain. Using that Red Chain, the mythical Pokémon can be summoned and shackled to do as we command... The PC entry ends there...

Press the button and set them free. Isn’t that why you came?
Our boss crafted a Red Chain from crystals he took from the three Pokémon. That Red Chain is what he needed to shackle something on Mt. Coronet. It’s also apparently needed for creating something. But that’s all I know. Who knows what he’s planning to do up there.

A chance to enjoy its sweets. I surely hope that our visionary Cyrus realizes his dream. I look forward to whatever our beloved leader has planned atop Mt. Coronet. 
Saturn: Gramps. Our boss can do without your kind of moral support.
Charon: Humph. Saturn and even Cyrus fall to a mere child... Team Galactic’s state of affairs is worrying... That plan of Cyrus’s atop Mt. Coronet, too... Who knows if it will work. ...Hmm. Perhaps another option needs to be considered. One befitting the genius of Charon!

Cyrus: Fellow members of Team Galactic! Hear me! My name, as I appear to you today, is Cyrus. This world of ours is a crude one. In a word, it is incomplete. It has been, and always will be, a struggle to survive in this world. We humans and Pokémon are likewise incomplete. Because we are all so lacking, we fight, we maim... It is ugly. I hate the incompleteness. That we are all incomplete, I hate it with my entire body and being. The world should be complete. The world must change. 
Then, who will change it? Me, Cyrus. And Team Galactic. Yes, all of you. Together we pored over myths and exposed their secrets. Together we captured legendary Pokémon. And now, Team Galactic has obtained the energy to change the world! The power of dreams is within our grasp! 
Understand it, fellow members! My long-held dreamworld is on the verge of becoming reality. All those headed to Mt. Coronet, and those who remain here... Though our missions may differ, our hearts beat as one. Let there be glory for Team Galactic! 
Grunts: WROOOAR!! 
Grunt: Master Cyrus is the greatest! 
Looker: ...Whew. So, that was Cyrus, the boss of the Team Galactic. Quite the performance, no? Mesmerizing for one only 27 years old. ...But to make a world for Team Galactic and none other? It is preposterous. So much so that it makes my head spin. A new world? What is that? And what is this incomplete world? Very well. To investigate such matters is the job of the International Police. Of which I am a member in good stead. And it is my job, therefore. We shall part ways here. Take extra care, my friend!

Dawn: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! It’s T-Team Galactic! They’re taking the Pokémon of the lake... I... I couldn’t beat this person...
Lucas: It’s Team Galactic! They took the Pokémon of the lake... This woman... I lost to her, but just barely!
Mars: That face...! It brings back bad memories! I’m talking about the windworks! I caught a whole lot of trouble for that little incident. What’s with that look on your face? You do remember me, don’t you? Fine, whatever. I’ll tell you who I am again! I’m Mars, one of Team Galactic’s Commanders. So, what is it? Are you some lovey-dovey couple to the rescue? Not a chance! Not even a teeny one! You’re all going down! 
I lost again... So, first the windworks, and now Lake Verity that I owe you for! This shouldn’t be happening to Team Galactic’s Commander... ...Calm down, Mars... I’ve done my part in all of this... My mission was to transport the lake’s Pokémon to our HQ... ...That’s right! I accomplished my mission without a problem! 
Team! We’re pulling out! The boss is waiting at the HQ! 
The Pokémon of the three lakes are connected somehow. Thanks to Saturn’s grandstanding at Lake Valor, a cavern appeared here. It was the cavern where the Pokémon MESPRIT slept. MESPRIT appeared, too, probably to go help its friends. That worked out well for us. It was super easy to catch. So, now we’ve got them all: MESPRIT, “The Being of Emotion.” AZELF, “The Being of Willpower.” UXIE, “The Being of Intelligence.” Now that we have them all... You can look forward to what plans Team Galactic has for them! 
Rowan: I see... This also occurred at Lake Valor... Another legendary Pokémon was taken away by Team Galactic... Both of you went up against full-fledged criminals... The fact that you’re unharmed is reason enough to celebrate. ...But what about [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? What is happening at Lake Acuity? Is [VAR(259, 0, 0)] safe?
Rowan: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I need you to go to Lake Acuity right away. I’m worried about [VAR(259, 1, 0)].
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], what is Team Galactic up to? Are the abducted Pokémon of the lakes going to be OK?
Lucas: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], what’s Team Galactic up to? They’d better not harm the Pokémon they took from the lakes...

Kyauun. 
MESPRIT flew off somewhere... 
Rowan: ... ... [VAR(259, 0, 0)], that was MESPRIT, wasn’t it? You’ve accomplished what I’d asked you to do at the Canalave Library... I asked you to get data on the Pokémon of the lake, and you did. But it didn’t provide any answers about the mysteries of evolution. I still don’t know why some Pokémon evolve and others don’t. Ultimately, it only deepened the mystery. But having mysteries to solve... That adds to my enjoyment! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], why don’t you chase after MESPRIT? To me, it seemed as if it wanted to play with you. If you were to use the Pokétch app Marking Map, you’d be able to track the movements of Pokémon. 
What? You don’t have the Marking Map? ...You should occasionally pay visits to the Pokétch Company, you know. 
Go on, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I’m sure that you will keep meeting countless Pokémon and people. Those encounters will keep thrilling you in their own special ways. I hope you’ll enjoy that experience! Take care, [VAR(259, 0, 0)].

Gah! Even I, a Commander, only managed to buy us time? But that’s fine. A child like you will never be able to stem the flow of time! Team Galactic will get the three legendary Pokémon of the lakes! With their power, we will create an entirely new universe! You will bear witness, as you are helpless to stop us!

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: What’d I say? I told you I’ll be OK by myself. If you haven’t gone yet, go challenge the Sunyshore Gym. I have a feeling things are going to keep getting tougher. It could be rough if you don’t collect up some Gym Badges.

Oh? Don’t I know you? We met in Eterna City. Listen. Team Galactic is going to do something huge for everyone’s sake. That’s why you should keep out of Team Galactic’s way. Don’t come whining about poor Pokémon and other trivial junk like that. Don’t waste your time coming to our HQ in Veilstone. Now, if you’ll excuse me. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: ... ... Yeah, that’s right! I couldn’t do anything against Team Galactic! 
That Pokémon called UXIE... It was suffering... 
I’m going to get tougher... It’s not about winning or losing... That’s not good enough... I have to be stronger... It’s not enough to just want to be the most powerful Trainer ever... It takes honest effort... And a determined heart.

How’s it going? If things aren’t going well, why not grab some prizes here? It might toughen up your Pokémon just enough to do better.
Gramma, Gramma! I went and traded! You can have this, Gramma! 
Oh, what is it, dear? Oh, a Sludge Bomb... Why, thank you so much, dear. You’re such a cute, tough, and kind girl... I feel blessed to have a grandchild like you...

Welcome to the Battle Tower! I am your guide to the Single and Double Battle Rooms. 
Would you like to take the Battle Room challenge?
We hope to see you again!
The Battle Tower is a facility for Single or Double Battle challenges. Once entered, your challenge lasts until you lose. In Single Battle format, you enter with three Pokémon. In Double Battle format, you enter with four Pokémon. The battles are held in Battle Rooms, of which there are many in the Tower. In each of the Battle Rooms, seven Trainers await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that!

Would you like to take the Multi Battle Room challenge?
                          
The Battle Tower’s Multi Battle Rooms are for Multi Battles with a partner. To enter, join another Trainer and compete with two Pokémon each. Inside the tower is a room named the Battle Salon where you can meet other Trainers. There, you can find a Trainer to act as your partner in the Multi Battles. You can also partner up with a friend over wireless communications. Once you have partnered up, you will be shown to a Multi Battle Room. In the Multi Battle Room, seven tag teams await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven teams, you will earn Battle Points. If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Also, if you are on a tag team with a friend, you may not interrupt your challenge.

Welcome to the Battle Tower! I am your guide to the Wi-Fi Battle Rooms. 
Would you like to take the Wi-Fi Battle Room challenge?
The Battle Tower’s Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are places to conduct battles over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. As a result, you will be battling Trainers from around the world. Inside the Battle Tower, there are many Battle Rooms. In each of the Battle Rooms, seven Trainers await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven, you will earn Battle Points. Depending on how you do, you may even become the room’s leader! Also, the Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are operated on a ranking system. Trainers will go up in rank if they keep winning Wi-Fi Battles. Contrarily, their rankings could go down if they lose consistently. To raise your rank, keep winning, especially against tougher Trainers. If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. 
We hope to see you again!

You can call me the Judge. Heheh, it’s actually not my real name, but that’s what everyone calls me. It’s because of this weird power I have. It’s a gift, really. I can discern, judge you can say, the overall potential of individual Pokémon. If you’d like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon. 
If you’d like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon. 
...Oh. You don’t need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?! That’s a tall order even for me. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon’s potential is decent all around. That’s my judgment, and it’s final. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon’s potential is above average overall. That’s my judgment, and it’s final. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon has relatively superior potential overall. That’s my judgment, and it’s final. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon has outstanding potential overall. That’s my judgment, and it’s final. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its HP. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Attack stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Defense stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Atk stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Def stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Speed stat. 
It’s rather decent in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
It’s very good in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
It’s fantastic in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
It can’t be better in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
A Ribbon will be awarded to the participating Pokémon!

Congratulations on your winning streak, challenger! The Frontier Brain has sent word that he is impressed with you. He recognizes your skill, and he’d like to challenge you to a battle! Are you ready to battle the Tower Tycoon?
Hi! My name’s Palmer. I remember you from when you were in Twinleaf, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. You were always playing with my son [VAR(259, 1, 0)], right? You’ve grown up since then, and most impressively, too! So, I’d like you to show me. Show me the bond you’ve built with your Pokémon. Show me the skill you’ve acquired as a Trainer! 
Palmer: So, you’ve come this far! As the Tower Tycoon, I’ll have to give you my best effort. That’s how the best Trainers show respect to each other. By battling all out as dedicated students of Pokémon! 
Bravo! I imagine many great Trainers will come to challenge me as you have just done. That’s something I look forward to a great deal. You will become even more skilled, the very same way your father did. Keep battling Trainers from around the world and keep growing greater in stature! 
Bravo! I feel inspired in my heart! It brings back a memory of that day long ago as a child... I went out to the lake with your father that day... We were attacked by a wild Pokémon. We fended it off, but I don’t recall  how. It was that desperate. That was my first step as a Trainer. I wonder if the professor is doing well? ...That’s enough reminiscing. My young friend, the world and your future hold infinite promise. Go on, you can be all that you desire! There is no limit to where you can go! 
You have cleared your seventh match! Congratulations! In honor of your talent, we present you BP!

Please find a partner from the Trainers that are gathered here. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], you have not found a partner for your tag team. Would you like to quit looking and return to the reception counter?
Thank you for choosing a partner. I will now show you to your Multi Battle Room. 
Riley: The partners I have now? Well, my [VAR(256, 0, 0)]’s nasty with its [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. And there’s my [VAR(256, 2, 0)], which is a sure hand with [VAR(262, 3, 0)]. Would you like to team up with me?
Riley: ...Oh, is that so? That’s too bad.
Riley: Ahaha, thanks. I’ll be waiting for you. 
Cheryl: I have [VAR(256, 0, 0)] that is very good with [VAR(262, 1, 0)], and [VAR(256, 2, 0)] that likes to show off its [VAR(262, 3, 0)]. Will you team up with me again?
Cheryl: Oh... Too bad...
Cheryl: I’ll go on ahead, then. 
Buck: Yo, are you looking to team up? Let me tell you what I’ve got. My [VAR(256, 0, 0)]’s first-rate with [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. And my [VAR(256, 2, 0)] is the best when it comes to using [VAR(262, 3, 0)]. You want to go with me, don’t you?
Buck: Huh? What? That’s pretty cold of you!
Buck: Hehehe! Good choice! There’s no problem when I’m around!

Battle Tower... Its height is a symbol of its challenge to Trainers.
All the places in the Battle Frontier let you team up with a friend!
I don’t think it’s good enough for an Idol to just be cute, sing, and dance. I should learn more about Pokémon so I can attract the Poké maniacs.
I get to battle with the world’s best in do-or-die situations here.
The most important person in the Battle Castle is a lady. Lady, like a princess, I mean.
What makes me the most happy being a Trainer? The fact that Pokémon will always be with me!
Behind every Pokémon, there is a story. Isn’t that right, dear?
Like a Pokémon and Trainer, we have been together for a long time. Eventually, we will be parted... Until then, I will cherish the time we have, dearest.
People expect so much from a maid. Cooking, cleaning, and laundry... Not to mention being good at training Pokémon!
To be strong is to be weak. To be weak is to be strong. I was told that a long time ago. Not that I have any clue what it means.
There are those who love battling from deep in the cockles of their hearts. The people that gather here? That would be them.
I wonder how many years it’s been since I first met a Pokémon? How much time has passed for you and your Pokémon?
Trainers can command Pokémon to use moves in battle with confidence. They can do that because Trainers believe in their Pokémon. In turn, Pokémon repay that trust by using moves the best they can. This may seem obvious, but it’s actually incredibly amazing!
I treat every battle as if it were my last. Going into battle willing to accept a loss? Unforgivable! But losing is also inevitable. A good Trainer learns from it.
The Pokémon’s type! The moves to be learned! The items to be held! If your aim is to be no. 1 here, you can’t overlook a single detail.
You know, when I lose, the first thing I do is look for who to blame. Like, the opponent cheated, or I was unlucky, or it’s my Pokémon’s fault... But I know I shouldn’t do that. I won’t get better unless I change.
There are five facilities in the Battle Frontier. At every one, you can win your way through to challenge the boss. I think they’re called Brains, and they’re out-of-this-world tough!
I know it’s no revelation now, but... The way of Pokémon is deep.
At the Battle Factory, you have to keep winning with rental Pokémon. It’s a real test of your knowledge. It’s perfect for a student like me!
The Battle Hall is where I want to be. Even the MAGIKARP I caught fishing has a shot at no. 1!
My inflatable tube lets me ride out the ebbs and flows of life.
Welcome to the Exchange Service Corner! Would you like to trade in your BP for some prizes?

Welcome to the Battle Frontier! This is your first visit? Right this way, please! 
Oh! You have a Vs. Recorder! How nice! We upgrade Vs. Recorders for first-time visitors for Battle Frontier use. I’ll borrow yours for a moment. Let’s see... Slide open this part here, and ticka-tacka-kachunk there! All done! Here you go. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s Vs. Recorder was upgraded.
Our other staff will be pleased to explain how the individual facilities of the Battle Frontier operate. I can go over general topics. Do you have any questions?
Which topic should I explain?
The Battle Frontier has five facilities dedicated to battling. At the Battle Tower, the objective is to beat seven Trainers in a row. At the Battle Hall, you may keep battle records of individual Pokémon. At the Battle Factory, you must win consecutive battles with rentals. The Battle Castle forces Trainers to manage Castle Points to advance. And finally, the Battle Arcade is where random luck triggers events. 
The battles at the five Battle Frontier facilities are held under special rules. First and foremost, no Exp. Points can be earned. Consequently, the Pokémon battling here will not level up. If the Level 50 rule is chosen, Pokémon of higher levels will be temporarily reduced to Lv. 50. Pokémon under Lv. 50 will be entered without an upward level adjustment. 
Battle Points are usually referred to as BP. BP are points that are used only in the Battle Frontier. BP are awarded for meeting certain performance goals at the various Battle Frontier facilities. BP can be exchanged for prizes at the Exchange Service Corner. 
The Exchange Service Corner is the tent straight ahead past here. There, you may exchange your BP for a wide variety of prizes. Please do visit it! 
The Performance Monitor shows Trainer data, such as the previous record and the best record to date. You will find one near the reception counter in each facility. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!

Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Tower works?
The Battle Tower is the building at the back of the Battle Frontier. The object is to enter a team of different Pokémon and battle on until you lose. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Factory works?
The Battle Factory is at the upper- right corner of the Battle Frontier. There, you engage in a knockout tournament with rented Pokémon. The goal is to keep winning for as long as possible. Every time you win a match, you may trade one of your Pokémon for one of the opponent’s Pokémon. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Hall works?
The Battle Hall is at the upper-left corner of the Battle Frontier. Here, you enter one Pokémon of your choosing for one-on-one battles. The objective is to keep your winning streak going as long as possible. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Castle works?
The Battle Castle is at the lower-left corner of the Battle Frontier. Here, you are provided with Castle Points, CP, that you must manage. The CP are used for healing Pokémon, renting items or Berries, and so on. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive while managing your CP. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Arcade works?
The Battle Arcade is at the lower-right corner of the Battle Frontier. Here, a game board is activated before every match. Depending on what comes up on the game board, an event takes place. Some events will be good to the challenger, while others won’t be. The challenger may even avoid having to battle at all. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive as long as possible. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
The Battle Frontier is up ahead! What kinds of Trainers will I see? What battles will I experience? It’s a whole new adventure for me!
The five facilities of the Battle Frontier are... Tower. Hall. Castle. Factory. And Arcade. How do you make an acronym out of that? THCFA? Rearrange those letters, maybe? FATCH! CHAFT! ...Nope! Nothing works! Didn’t anyone think of this?!
The Vs. Recorder is sure nifty! Touching the screen shows you how much BP you have.
My dream is to battle Palmer of the Battle Tower. I want to record it for posterity on my Vs. Recorder. But I’m not good enough to battle my way to see Palmer... I’m heartbroken!

Welcome to the Battle Factory! I am your guide to the Single and Double Battle challenges. Please be aware that these challenges are designed for a single Trainer. 
Which challenge would you like to take?
At the Battle Factory, you may take Single or Double Battle challenges using rental Pokémon. Once entered, your challenge lasts until you lose. After each win, you may trade a rented Pokémon for one of the opponent’s. The Level 50 option starts you off with Pokémon that only know weak moves. The Open Level option gives you access to Lv. 100 Pokémon with powerful moves from the start. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that! 
Welcome to the Battle Factory! I am your guide to the Multi Battle challenge. Please be aware that this challenge requires two Trainers. 
Would you like to take the Battle Factory Multi Battle challenge?
You may team up with a friend for a Multi Battle challenge using rental Pokémon. Both partners will be provided with two rental Pokémon each. Once entered, you and your partner conduct Multi Battles until you lose. After each win, you or your partner may trade a single rented Pokémon. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). The Level 50 option starts with rental Pokémon that only know weak moves. The Open Level option lets you rent Lv. 100 Pokémon with powerful moves from the start. Please note: a Battle Factory Multi Battle challenge can’t be interrupted. 
We hope to see you again!
Which challenge level would you like to play? Level 50 or Open Level?
You must save the game before I show you in. Is that OK?
Right this way, please!
We look forward to your next visit. 
We’ve missed you! You must save the game before you resume your challenge. Please wait.
Excuse me! You didn’t save before you quit your challenge last time. Because of that, you have been disqualified from your challenge!

They’re very helpful here. The staff tell you about the next Trainer you’ll face.
Want to hear my trick to choosing Pokémon? Get your opponent’s lineup and choose accordingly. That’s rock-solid basic!
Memorize what moves the opponent’s Pokémon used. That way, you’ll know what to expect when you’re choosing one for trade.
I’ll teach you my style. My way of doing things. Basically, I choose Pokémon that I’ve never raised before. Doing that, I get more knowledgeable. Better Pokémon intelligence. That knowledge is power. It makes me a better Trainer.
Howdy-do! Do you raise Pokémon? You sure do. Of course you do. But do you raise every kind of Pokémon? No, no, no. Not likely you do. This is a wonderful place. You can challenge with nothing. Of course, all you can challenge with are rental Pokémon. Remember this, my favorite place to be. Its name: the Battle Factory!
Oh, my goodness, what am I to do? I didn’t expect this to happen! The Pokémon I battled with became my favorites. But I already have six favorites!
There were some Pokémon I hated because they were so tough to battle. But when I had them on my side, they won me over with their power.

Welcome to the Battle Hall! I am your guide to the Single and Double Battle challenges. Please be aware that these challenges are designed for a single Trainer. 
Which challenge would you like to take?
At the Battle Hall, you may take Single or Double Battle challenges alone. For the Single Battle challenge, you enter one Pokémon of at least Lv. 30. The Double Battle Challenge requires you to enter two of the same kind of Pokémon that are at least Lv. 30 each. Winning-streak records are kept for individual kinds of Pokémon. That makes it possible for any kind of Pokémon to aim for no. 1. When you enter the Hall, you will be asked to choose the type and rank of the Pokémon you want to battle. If you manage to win ten matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that! 
Welcome to the Battle Hall! I am your guide to the Multi Battle challenge. Please be aware that this challenge requires two Trainers. 
Would you like to take the Battle Hall Multi Battle challenge?
You may team up with a friend for a Multi Battle challenge using the same kind of Pokémon that are at least Lv. 30 each. When you enter the Hall, you will be asked to choose the type and rank of the Pokémon you want to battle. If you manage to win ten matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP).

Please come see me when you are ready. 
The Battle Hall Multi Battle challenge requires both partners to enter the same kind of Pokémon. Please confer with your friend and choose the same kind of Pokémon. 
       
When it comes to food, this Hiker chows down on the favorites first. But here, I start with types that my Pokémon doesn’t like. Why? Because the opposition goes up in level as you progress.
That opulent stage! Every Pokémon can get up there. Yes! You can try for a record with your one favorite Pokémon. Even a Pokémon that’s not considered a good battler can make a challenge.
Pachipachi... My PACHIRISU is a cutie, but he’s even battled the Brain here. The Brain will take your Pokémon on at the same level, to be fair.
PACHIRISU: Pachipachi pacchipachii!
You should try the Battle Hall with different kinds of Pokémon, too. Doing that, you’ll be building your overall record as well.
There’s a key point to keep in mind here. If it’s the same kind of Pokémon, you can enter different ones. That means you can have different ones knowing different types of moves. That could make it easier to win against certain types.
You know how CROAGUNK has two types: Poison and Fighting? That means it can appear as a Poison type and as a Fighting type.
Ohoho! Ohohohoho! I’m the mysterious maid! And what is mysterious about me is the mysterious part! And now, a piece of advice. At the Battle Hall, the opposing Pokémon are matched in level to yours. That way, you can make challenges without worrying about levels.
There’s this game that I’m totally into right now. My friend and I started challenges with identical conditions. We’re competing over who can stretch their win streak the longest. It’s fun!
I keep track of the total number of wins from your longest Single Battle win streaks at the Battle Hall. To explain, I add only the longest win streaks of each kind of Pokémon.
When your total win-streak record hits certain figures, you will earn BP as rewards. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your total win-streak record is presently [VAR(311, 1, 0)]. 
Your total win-streak record has reached [VAR(311, 2, 0)]. Here is your BP reward. 
When your total win-streak record reaches [VAR(311, 3, 0)], you will earn BP.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received [VAR(309, 4, 0)] BP!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], your total win-streak record stands at [VAR(311, 1, 0)]. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], your total win-streak record stands at [VAR(311, 1, 0)]. ...My goodness! That’s a fantastic record!
Winston: The Battle Hall’s been kind of boring lately. There haven’t been any dazzling challengers who can electrify crowds. The kind of challenger who can beat the Brain... Aren’t there any around?
Winston: Let me take a wild guess. Are you getting into the Battle Hall? It’s addictively fun, huh? The more you win, the more kinds of Pokémon you get to see, too.
Winston: ... ...Oh, sorry for staring! I saw you on stage the last time. You’ve got some star quality. I think I’m going to keep an eye on you. There’s real charisma there.
Winston: I check you out every time you get up on stage. You’re fun to watch, let me tell you. Now I’m always looking forward to seeing the combo of you and your Pokémon on stage.
Winston: Hey, there! What are you going to do this time? Which Pokémon are you going for a record with next? When I get to thinking about that, I get too wound up to sleep at night. That’s why I’ve been sleeping in lately!
Winston: Awesome! Seriously awesome! You’re beyond awesome, even! The love you show so many Pokémon... It’s no easy feat, I can tell ya!
Winston: I’ve never seen Pokémon battle as enjoyably as yours do. You’re the first of a kind for me as Trainers go. You know, I brag about you to everyone who’s willing to listen. I was saying that you’re going to be a star before you even got a record!
Winston: Go, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], go! Go, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], go! I’m thinking up some dance steps and cheers I can do to support you. If you want to see them, you’ll need to keep working on your records!
Winston: You’re phenomenal. All the battles you waged on stage... All those moments of glory... Your star burns so bright and huge! I can barely open my eyes around you!
Winston: The love for Pokémon you exhibited at the Battle Hall is as infinitely deep as it is wide... You can count on me, Winston, to be your lifelong fan. Just as you love Pokémon, I love you as the Pokémon superstar!
Serena: It’s about the Battle Hall... It hasn’t excited me lately. There’s been no gorgeous sort of challenger who can dazzle me. The kind of challenger who can make me a fan... Aren’t there any around?
Serena: Um... Excuse me? If you don’t mind me asking, are you getting into the Battle Hall? It’s fun in an engrossing way, isn’t it? Did you know? The more you win, the more kinds of Pokémon appear.
Serena: Um... Excuse me? I watched you when you were on stage. It made me feel all tingly seeing you. Um... You won’t mind if I cheer for you from now on, will you? Please, may I?
Serena: Um... Excuse me? I cheer for you the best I can. I can’t get up on stage with you, but I want to lend my support to your Pokémon and you for trying so hard.
Serena: Um... Excuse me? Can you tell me what kind of Pokémon you’re going for a record with next? When I start thinking about that, I get sort of all choked up. I have trouble sleeping at night when I get that way.
Serena: Um... Excuse me? Fantastic! It’s fantastic! You’re fabulously fantastic! The love you show so many Pokémon... It must take extraordinary effort.
Serena: I’ve never seen Pokémon battle as enjoyably as yours do. You’re the first Trainer ever who’s done that. I... I brag about you to all my friends. I hope you don’t mind. I tell them I wish I could be as wonderful a Trainer as you!
Serena: Hurray, hurray, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Go, Pokémon, go! ...Oh! Um... Excuse me. I was working on cheers and a dance routine for you. B-but, I’m sorry for being so silly and giddy and...
Serena: You’re so inspiring to me. All the glory you earned while battling so often on that shining stage... Just seeing you makes me feel all happy inside. ♫
Serena: Your Pokémon love that you’ve shown at the Battle Hall is as infinitely deep as it is wide... It’s amazing, but you love every kind of Pokémon there is. I love you for being so amazing and dedicated!
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Do you know what I’ve been doing? I go looking for the Pokémon that take the stage with you. I catch them, too! My Pokédex is filling up from it. I guess I can thank you for that, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. So, thank you!
Lucas: These stage battles are lots of fun just to watch! You get to see so many different kinds of Pokémon. It’s cool.
Mom: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! When I come here, I cheer for everyone on stage. I can’t help myself. But when I see you win, it does feel different. It’s not just about feeling happy. It evokes something in me.
Oak: You keep amazing me over and over. What a Trainer you turned out to be! It’s not enough that you caught Pokémon in numbers beyond belief. That alone is fantastic enough, but you’ve battled with them as well. You’re what all Trainers should aspire to be!
Jasmine: I love showy events like Battle Hall challenges and Contests. They show me aspects of Pokémon that I didn’t know about.

Welcome to the Battle Castle! I am your guide to the Single and Double Battle challenges. Please be aware that these challenges are designed for a single Trainer. 
Which challenge would you like to take?
At the Battle Castle, you may take a Single or Double Battle challenge. Here, you are provided with Castle Points (CP) that you must manage. The CP are used for healing Pokémon, renting items or Berries, and so on. CP are earned by winning matches. The amount varies by how you win. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive while managing your CP. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that! 
Welcome to the Battle Castle! I am your guide to the Multi Battle challenge. Please be aware that this challenge requires two Trainers. 
Would you like to take the Battle Castle Multi Battle challenge?
You may team up with a friend for a Multi Battle challenge. Both Trainers are provided with Castle Points (CP) that must be managed. The CP is used for healing Pokémon, renting items or Berries, and so on. Trainers can use their CP on not only their own Pokémon, but also their partner’s. Both Trainers earn CP by winning matches. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive while managing your CP. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). Please note: a Battle Castle Multi Battle challenge can’t be interrupted. 
We hope to see you again!

One Trainer should select “BECOME LEADER.” The other Trainer must select “JOIN GROUP.”
We need to launch DS Wireless Communications.
You must save the game before I show you in. Please wait.
If your Pokémon win without taking damage, you earn more CP.
You can earn more CP by facing higher- level opponents. It’s meaningless if you don’t win, of course.
Before every battle, you should check the opponent’s lineup. Don’t be cheap with your CP. It’s like that old saying goes about knowing your enemy. “If you know yourself but not your enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.” In other words, it all goes up in smoke if you lose!
Mr. Darach... Oh, how I pine for thee...
At first, you can only use CP for restoring HP. You can spend CP to rank up, though. Doing that, you can even restore PP.
I have a matter of grave importance to share with you. I can’t stress just how important this is for me to say. If you lose, your entire stock of CP is cleaned out to zero! How tragic!
Like every man’s dream, I want to live in a castle!

Welcome to the Battle Arcade! I am your guide to the Single and Double Battle challenges. Please be aware that these challenges are designed for a single Trainer. 
Which challenge would you like to take?
At the Battle Arcade, you may take a Single or Double Battle challenge. Here, a game board is activated before every match. Depending on what comes up on the game board, an event takes place. Some events will be good for the challenger, while others won’t be. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive as long as possible. During your challenge, any items held by your Pokémon will be kept in storage. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that! 
Welcome to the Battle Arcade! I am your guide to the Multi Battle challenge. Please be aware that this challenge requires two Trainers. 
Would you like to take the Battle Arcade Multi Battle challenge?
You may team up with a friend for a Multi Battle challenge. Here, a game board is activated before every match. Depending on what comes up on the game board, an event takes place. The events may have great impact on the match’s outcome, good or bad. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive as long as possible. During your challenge, any items held by your Pokémon will be kept in storage. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). Please note: a Battle Arcade Multi Battle challenge can’t be interrupted. 
We hope to see you again!

Those who rule the game board reign at the Battle Arcade! It sounds sort of profound, but it’s actually no-kidding obvious!
It all comes down to luck here... My cute Pokémon... They were helplessly frozen.
There’s nothing you can do about luck. It’s just there or not.
Don’t be awestruck watching the motion of the game board. If you don’t stop it in 30 seconds, it will stop by itself.
The Brain has a peculiar fashion sense. She flits around oddly, too. Kind of like this. A little bump, a wiggle... ...Please don’t look at me that way. It’s not nice.
Yikes, they can even start battles with the move Trick Room in effect? A strategy built around Speed could backfire right in your face!
Be thrilled by the unknown hand of luck! Leap into battles ruled by fickle fate! That’s how you enjoy the Battle Arcade!
Blaming the game board for losing is pitiful. It’s poor form. The game board will show better choices the greater the wins you achieve.
Did you figure this one out? Poisoning or freezing events can be made ineffective. ...If the Pokémon’s type or ability protects it from such status problems.
If the game board triggers a paralyzing event here, Ground types aren’t affected.

Cynthia: This place... 
Can you feel it? There are no Pokémon here at all. Time isn’t flowing. And space isn’t stable. A world where the rules are broken. A space one might call the Distortion World... 
Let’s find GIRATINA. We need it to stop the spreading distortion at the Spear Pillar... 
Cynthia: That was... GIRATINA...!
We have to hurry! If something’s not done, the distortion will swallow not only our world, it will overwhelm the Distortion World... 
Cynthia: This rock slab... It appears to move if you step on a certain spot.
Cynthia: On the ground here... Why is it colored differently?
There is the portal leading back to the Spear Pillar. Leap into the portal and return to the Spear Pillar?

Cynthia: The legend of GIRATINA has been all but forgotten but to a few... The legend told of a world on the other side of ours. This world. Why does this world exist? Why is GIRATINA here all alone? ...There’s so much that can’t be explained, but we have things to do. Let’s split up. We have to find the right way. 
We don’t need to go together now. Let’s keep looking for the way down.

Cyrus: ...The shadowy Pokémon isn’t here. It abandoned me here, then disappeared somewhere farther down... Was it content merely to interfere with my plan...? Incidentally, do you understand the concept of genes?
...If it’s true, you’ve impressed me. 
...No, of course, you wouldn’t. 
Genes can be considered the blueprints of all life-forms. That includes humans and Pokémon alike. Genes are contained in a DNA strand. A DNA strand consists of two chains of opposing characteristics in a spiral. If one of the chains were to be broken, the other could replicate it. One or the other cannot exist without its opposite. Do you understand where I am going with this? This is a bizarre world. Time doesn’t flow. Space isn’t stable. Only that shadowy Pokémon lives here. This world is the opposite of our  world--our world I wish to change. It is like the two chains composing a strand of DNA. The two worlds must be balancing each other to remain in existence. Without the one, the other cannot exist. The shadowy Pokémon must play a role in keeping the worlds in balance. That is why it must have interfered and brought me here. 
The shadowy Pokémon must have made this bizarre world. That’s why trying to change our world disturbed it and made it reveal itself. But that is all irrelevant. What matters is defeating that Pokémon and making this world disappear. I won’t allow it to interfere with me again. With it gone, neither world will be able to revert to its original state...

MESPRIT: Piih! 
UXIE: Piih! 
AZELF: Piiuw! 
Cynthia: This place... It seems to be a giant puzzle. Maybe GIRATINA wants to test those that visit here? It appears as if we can’t go on unless we solve the puzzle. There were some boulders that could be moved... And there are several odd pits on the floor... The Pokémon of the lakes seem eager to show us something...
Cynthia: I guess the Pokémon of the lakes must have gone home. I understand they can keep balance against either PALKIA or DIALGA. Does it mean they can’t do that with GIRATINA? ...Oops. This is no time for idle chitchat. 
Cynthia: Call it a Trainer’s intuition, but we’re getting close. Let’s go on!
At the bottom of the pit is a space that a boulder might fit into...

===============================
Text File: 319
===============================
Cynthia: This is it... GIRATINA is up ahead. 
Cynthia: ...So, you were already here. 
Cynthia: Why do you seek to change the world? If you hate our world, you should just go off somewhere alone. Find somewhere where you can live without seeing others. 
Cynthia: But... That’s no justice at all!
Cyrus: Why should I run and hide from the world and have to wait quietly? My aim is to rid our world of the vague and incomplete thing we call spirit. By freeing ourselves of that, our world can be made complete. That is my justice! No one can interfere!
Cyrus: I won’t lose! Not to that shadowy Pokémon! Not in any worthless world! 
Cyrus: ...Don’t think that you can defeat or capture that Pokémon. This bizarre world is none other than that Pokémon itself! Capturing it or defeating it will make this world disappear! Very well! Do what you will! Rather than repairing the world, you’re going to destroy it for me! Do it. You inherit my legacy. 
Cynthia: Don’t believe his lies. It’s not possible that a Pokémon can make the world disappear. The world awaited your birth. Not only yours, either. The Pokémon with you. The people close to you. All the Pokémon and people were born because they have a part in the world. I’m convinced of that. GIRATINA won’t go out of existence. This Distortion World won’t disappear. Our world won’t disappear, either. Let’s go meet GIRATINA. ...Oops. I should do something about your hardworking Pokémon first. 
Cynthia fully healed [VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s Pokémon. 
Cynthia: Now let’s go meet GIRATINA! 
Cynthia: GIRATINA is enraged because the two worlds are endangered. It has merged the Distortion World and our world at the Spear Pillar. That’s why both worlds are becoming distorted. But there’s nothing to fear. You can defeat GIRATINA and show the tight bond you share with your Pokémon. Or you can demonstrate how much you want it to join you. If you succeed in doing either, GIRATINA will understand. The distortion of the two worlds will stop!
Cynthia: I know that the bond you share with your Pokémon is strong!

Giygogagohgwooh! 
Cynthia: GIRATINA seems to have understood us! 
Cyrus: That Pokémon... That shadowy Pokémon was defeated?! 
Cyrus: That Pokémon... That shadowy Pokémon was captured?! 
Cyrus: That shadowy Pokémon... You quelled its rage by refusing to battle it?! 
Your doing so means this irrational world will remain in existence! Does that make it impossible for me to create a new world? Even if I made new Red Chains, the new world can’t be made! Why?! What compels you to protect the two worlds? Is spirit, a vague and incomplete thing, so important to you?! 
Cynthia: ...The places we are born. The time we spend living... The languages we speak... We are all different. But the presence of Pokémon unites us. We share our lives with our Pokémon, and our happiness grows as we all become greater than we were alone. That is why we can battle and trade with anyone we choose... 
[VAR(65281, 200)]Silence![VAR(65281, 100)] 
Cyrus: Enough of your blathering! That’s how you justify spirit as something worthwhile?! That is merely humans hoping, deluding themselves that they are happy and safe! The emotions roiling inside me... Rage, hatred, frustration... These ugly emotions arise because of my own incomplete spirit! ...Enough. We will never see eye to eye. This, I promise you. I will break the secrets of the world. With that knowledge, I will create my complete and perfect world. One day, you will awaken to a world of my creation. A world without spirit. 
Cynthia: ... ... Since there is sadness, we can feel joy. When there is anger, compassion is born... 
Let’s go back home. The portal where GIRATINA was should lead back to our world. GIRATINA was written in legend as being on the other side of our world. It stands to reason that it has a link to the other side.

Congratulations to you, Trainer! In recognition of your outstanding winning streak, our Frontier Brain is demanding a match with you. So, your next match is against the Factory Head with no right of refusal! Are you prepared? 
Thorton: Bzweeeeep! Sorry, don’t mind me. What I’m using is an invention of mine. It’s my data-analyzing machine. It’s telling me what you’ve rented for this match. I see! You’ve rented [VAR(256, 0, 0)], [VAR(256, 1, 0)], and [VAR(256, 2, 0)]. I have to say, that’s a good setup. Like, say, [VAR(307, 3, 0)] percent? Oh, don’t let that number concern you! All righty, let’s get going! 
Thorton: Bzweeeeep! Let’s see what I can see about you through my data-analyzing machine. So, what have you rented for this match...? I see! You’ve rented [VAR(256, 0, 0)], [VAR(256, 1, 0)], and [VAR(256, 2, 0)]. I have to admit, that’s a good setup. It’s a combination of friendship with cooperation all around. I’d say it’s like [VAR(307, 3, 0)] percent? Oh, don’t let that number concern you! All righty, let’s get going! No losing for me this time! 
Thorton: Hmm... I got handed the loss here. It’s not making me happy at all, losing. Even though I’m not happy, I did glean some useful data, I suppose. That makes me glad I battled you. So, did you get to like those Pokémon you rented? As the Factory Head, it would sure make me happy if you did. Next time, come back with different rental Pokémon. 
Thorton: Hmm... I got handed another loss. It’s not making me happy at all, this. In fact, I’m stewing here. I thought I learned a lot about Pokémon since I lost to you. But that’s all right. Some things you learn from winning. But some things you learn by losing. I hope you’ll keep renting our Pokémon and give me a chance to redeem myself!

Which group would you like to join?
Oh. That’s too bad.
Oh, you want to make a new group? Sure thing! The group you made before will be disbanded, though. Is that OK?
Yay, cool! What do you want to name your group?

Welcome! This is the Global Trade Station, or GTS for short. We enable the trading of Pokémon with people worldwide over Nintendo WFC. Would you like to do a global Pokémon trade?
Hello! Welcome to the GTS! Would you like to do a global Pokémon trade over Nintendo WFC?
You may trade Pokémon one of two ways at the GTS. You may offer a Pokémon for trade, or search among offered Pokémon. Should I describe things in greater detail?
You will be asked to put up the Pokémon you are offering to trade. At that time, you will be asked what Pokémon you would like in return. If another player offers your desired Pokémon in return for your offered Pokémon, the trade will go through. Should I explain anything else?
You may search among the Pokémon that are offered by other Trainers. They will all identify what Pokémon their Trainers want back in return. If you find one that you want, you must provide us with the kind of Pokémon wanted in return. Should I explain anything else?
Would you like to make a global Pokémon trade?
Please do visit again.
I hope you enjoy your visit to the GTS!
That’s a big globe, eh? Where do I live on it now? Let’s see if I can point it out...
They say if you communicate with someone, their location is recorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon here to trade. Who knows, it might be traded while I’m asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with Pokémon fans from around the world. Isn’t that something?
You can register where you live on this giant globe. Once you do, your location will be displayed to anyone you communicate with.
Is Nintendo WFC something even I can use easily? If it is really that easy, I’d love to trade Pokémon, too!

Rowan: Ah, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve come to show me the progress you’ve made on your Pokédex?
Hmm... You’ve spotted [VAR(308, 0, 0)] Pokémon in Sinnoh... 
What’s wrong? You’re not suggesting you’ve seen so few that you’re afraid to show me?
                                             
I see! You’ve met all the Pokémon there are in Sinnoh! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I need to see you at my lab. I’ll be waiting!
I see! You’ve met all the Pokémon there are in Sinnoh!
Look harder for wild Pokémon. Don’t be afraid of going into tall grass.
Your pace is picking up. Things can only get better!
Be persistent when you’re searching for Pokémon that appear only in certain places.
Are you using fishing rods? Pokémon that live underwater need to be caught by fishing.
Remember, it’s important to make the Pokémon you’ve caught evolve.
Pokémon don’t just hide in tall grass. You can find many others in caves and seas.
The Trainers that challenge you to battle have Pokémon, obviously. They may have rare ones with them, and that can add to your Pokédex.
Some Pokémon appear only in the morning and some only at night. I know it’s a challenge, but I urge you to keep searching.
Fantastic! Your effort is helping us understand what evolving involves. Your Pokédex doesn’t have long to go now.
I’m simply astounded by the huge variety of Pokémon in Sinnoh. This will help my studies immensely! Sincerely, thank you!
Your Pokédex is well on the way to being filled up. This Pokédex can be considered a journal of your adventure.
You’re not far from seeing every Pokémon there is to see in Sinnoh!
Oak: Ah, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve come to show me how your Pokédex is coming along?
Oak: Ah, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve come to show me how your Pokédex is coming along?
Hmhm... You’ve caught [VAR(308, 0, 0)] so far... 
I see... Come see me if you’d like me to have a look at your Pokédex.
They say there are at least 400 species of Pokémon nationwide. If you’re planning to catch them all, you’d better be a committed Trainer.
Hm! Little by little, you’re filling the Pokédex with complete data on Pokémon you’ve gotten. Keep up the good work!
Here’s a tip on catching Pokémon in the wild. Minimize their HP before you throw your Poké Ball to catch them.
Remember: If you can’t catch them, you can always trade for them. As soon as you trade, the Pokémon’s data is added to the Pokédex. That’s why you should seek out as many trades as possible.
Have you visited the Great Marsh? Some Pokémon only appear in places such as that.
As you know, there are Pokémon that eventually evolve. That’s an important thing to consider when you’re filling your Pokédex.
You’ve proven yourself capable. There’s nothing to worry about. Keep catching Pokémon the way you’ve been doing so far.
Are you aware that there is more than one style of evolution? There are some Pokémon that evolve by becoming friends with the Trainer.
Apparently, there are some Pokémon that appear in swarms on occasion. Don’t miss out on these massive outbreaks of Pokémon!
Amazing! You’ve already gotten over 300 Pokémon! That’s already a major achievement, but I know you’re capable of more!
Some wild Pokémon only appear during certain times of the day. You’ll need to look for Pokémon around the clock.
I’ve been getting reports of different Pokémon sightings. By different, I mean Pokémon that aren’t native to the Sinnoh region. You should perhaps go back to areas you’ve already scoured. You may end up seeing Pokémon that weren’t there before.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], have you visited the Pal Park recently? There still may be Pokémon that are rarely seen in Sinnoh.

Hm! Your Pokédex is getting closer to completion. Have you ever considered a career as a Pokémon professor?
Hmm... You’ve caught quite the impressive collection of Pokémon. You’ve obviously had to employ many means to seek them all out. If you have a Poké Radar, keep an eye out for rustling tall grass.
I can only marvel at the diversity of Pokémon. I’m still very much in awe of them.
Good, good, you’re getting close to completing the Pokédex. I’m looking forward to seeing its completion. When that happens, your views about Pokémon will likely have changed!
Hmm... You are so very close to completing your Pokédex. Think about what’s missing. Recall what you’ve overlooked. You’re so close--please finish the Pokédex!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’ve finally done it! You’ve finally completed the National Pokédex! This is better than meeting any exotic Pokémon for the first time! I feel blessed to have become friends with a Trainer like you! Sincerely, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!

Hello there! It’s so very nice to meet you! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! 
My name is Rowan. However, everyone just calls me the Pokémon Professor. Before I go any further, is this your first adventure? If you need advice, I’m certainly capable of giving it. 
Moves the main character. Also used to choose various headings and selections.  Used to confirm a choice, check things, chat, and scroll text.  Used to exit, cancel a choice, and cancel a mode.
Press to open the menu.  Press to use an item, such as a Bicycle, that has been registered in advance.
The lower screen is called the Touch Screen.  The Touch Screen will display a variety of touch buttons depending on the situation.
If this mark is shown in the message window, there are active buttons you can touch on the Touch Screen below.
[VAR(512, 0)]
Do you understand everything so far?[VAR(512, 0)]
Please touch a button on the Touch Screen below.[VAR(512, 0)]
Would you like to know more about anything else? 
You are about to enter a world where you will embark on a grand adventure of your very own.
Speak to people and check things wherever you go, be it in towns, roads, or caves. Gather information and hints from every possible source.
New paths will open to you when you help people in need, overcome challenges, and solve mysteries.
At times, you will be challenged by others to a battle. At other times, wild creatures may stand in your way.  By overcoming such hurdles, you will gain great power.
However, your adventure is not solely about becoming powerful.
On your travels, we hope that you will meet countless people and, through them, achieve personal growth.  This is the most important objective of this adventure.
This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon. 
Here, I have a Poké Ball. Touch the button on the middle of the Poké Ball, if you’d please.[VAR(512, 0)]
No, no! Not that button! The button on the Poké Ball.[VAR(512, 0)]
We humans live alongside Pokémon as friends. At times we play together, and at other times we work together. Some people use their Pokémon to battle and develop closer bonds with them. What do I do? I conduct research so that we may learn more about Pokémon. 
Now, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
Are you a boy? Or are you a girl? 
All right, so you’re a boy? 
All right, so you’re a girl? 
Tell me, what is your name? 
Your name is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? 
Your name is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? 
OK... So, you’re [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? A fine name that is! Now, this boy here... I believe he’s your friend. 
What might his name be? 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)], is it? That’s your friend’s name? 
All right, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], the time has come. Your very own tale of grand adventure is about to unfold. On your journey, you will meet countless Pokémon and people. I’m sure that along the way you will discover many things, perhaps even something about yourself. Now, go on, leap into the world of Pokémon!

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: All right! We’re at the lake! Get ready, because we’re capturing that legendary Pokémon. Trust me on this one. It’s here. It even says so on the sign! 
                             
                                          
Lake Verity Ahead According to legend, this lake is home to the Pokémon said to be “The Being of Emotion.” It is because of this Pokémon that people can experience sorrow and joy.

...Pant...pant... ...Why am I running like this anyway?! That new world... The new universe that our boss was talking about... It’s making me giddy thinking about it... When we use this thing... 
Gweh! You were eavesdropping! I was only talking to myself! You’re persistent, too... I’m pooped out from all the running... But, I’m not... Going to battle you... 
Aww, no... You’re still on my tail...? The lake’s within sight... You leave me no choice... My Pokémon will KO you... 
I can’t battle anymore... I’m running on fumes... I’ll have to give this to the Commander... I wish... I got to use it at the lake... 
Cynthia: Oh, hello, long time no see! How is your Pokédex filling up? I came to research the folklore about the lake, but... Well, it doesn’t appear as if the lake is open to the public now. Have you heard the folklore about it? They say there is an island inside the lake. And inside that island is a mirage of a Pokémon. No one must enter the chamber of that Pokémon... Oh, that’s right! I had to talk to you about something else... 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)]: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Where’d that Galactic goon run off to? 
Huh? Is this your older sister? No? She isn’t? Oh, OK. 
That explosion in the Great Marsh? It wasn’t anything serious. Mr. Wake told me to tell you that. But that Team Galactic... Wow! Are they out of control or what? Next time I see them, I’ll teach them a lesson they won’t forget! See you around! 
Cynthia: He’s your friend? He’s more impatient than he is energetic, isn’t he? 
Cynthia: So, getting back to what I started saying earlier... Have you seen the group of PSYDUCK on Route 210?
Cynthia: Yes, that’s right. By the café on Route 210. You’ve seen that group of PSYDUCK huddled with their heads in their, uh, hands...? 
Cynthia: You haven’t seen them? By the café on Route 210. There’s a group of PSYDUCK huddled with their heads in their, uh, hands...? 
Anyway, what you should do is use this medicine on the PSYDUCK. You’re working on a Pokédex, so it would be worthwhile for you. 
Cynthia: I went on a big adventure with a Pokédex when I was younger. I hope you get to meet every kind of Pokémon there is to see. It may help you with the secret of the mirage Pokémon. See you later! 
They say there’s a legendary Pokémon in this lake. I aim to capture it on film like I’ve done before. It was me who filmed that red GYARADOS at Lake of Rage.
The Pokémon of the lake won’t come out if it senses people. We’re lying in ambush for it here.
Stop, stop! Yes, you! Sunyshore City, which is down this road, had a major blackout! Crews are working on restoring power, but the road’s closed now. 
Stop, stop! Yes, you! Sunyshore City, which is down this road, had a major blackout! Crews are working on restoring power, but the road’s closed now.
What am I to do...? I’ve gone and dropped my Suite Key somewhere again... The hotel people won’t be happy with me... I’m sure I had it when I left the reception counter earlier... If I only had the Pokétch app Dowsing Machine, it would be so easy to find...
What am I to do...? I’ve gone and dropped my Suite Key somewhere again... Oh! That’s my Suite Key! You found it for me? Oh, that’s sweet of you! Thank you! 
Seven Stars Restaurant More Flavor Than You Can Wish For

===============================
Text File: 402
===============================
At our restaurant, you can enjoy more than just exquisite dining. You may also partake in battles. Bon appetit!
I am so sorry. We are now closed. Please do visit while we are open. 
Before we make our toast, I’d hoped for a battle... However, you seem to be short a Pokémon for that.
If you want to have a battle with us, you’ll need to bring more Pokémon.
With someone as beautiful as you for my model, I am sure to paint a masterpiece! 
What is it? Do you wish for a battle? 
                                               
Though we lost our battle... A toast to your beauty, that no painting could ever hope to capture!
He said he’d treat me to a dinner here if I agreed to model for him. So, I came along, but I haven’t made up my mind yet. 
When I can’t decide, I battle to make the decision!
                                                           
I’ve decided to model for him. That’s given me an appetite!
There is no price too high for the sake of my art... That said, my oh my, these meals look awfully pricey... 
What is it? Are you feeling hungry, too? Oh, I see, that’s not it! You wanted a battle!
                                           
My hors d’oeuvres have gone cold...
I have to slow down on eating these delicious hors d’oeuvres. I don’t want to be all bloated by the time the main dish comes. 
I’d like a light battle to work up my appetite. Would you care to join us?
                                                                  
The hors d’oeuvres haven’t grown cold... These are supposed to be served chilled!
The worth of a meal isn’t determined merely by its flavor. Presentation, that is, color and placement, is vital. In other words, a fine meal can be likened to the finest work of art... 
And in Pokémon battles, I also hope to see beauty. You do agree with me, yes?
                                                                                                 
The meals prepared here are not merely tasty, they are also healthy. Diners need not worry about ruining their figures eating here.
Today’s main dish is scrumptiously delicious! If I can keep eating this food, I’ll model anytime I can! 
I feel guilty just eating all this delicious food like this. I’ll join in the battle, too!
                                                              
The models of great paintings were often rather plump. That means I can keep eating without obsessing over my figure!
If you want to challenge us, bring some more Pokémon.
If you want to battle us, you have to have at least two Pokémon!
Actually, my father happens to be the chef here. 
What is it? A battle? Bahaha... You think you can beat me?
                           
We’ve lost, but let’s make a toast to our future together anyway!
Oh, my! Your father is the chef here? How wonderful! 
I haven’t told him, but my father owns the hotel and restaurant... Oh, but that’s beside the point. Would you care for a battle?
                                           
Let’s make a toast to the prosperity of the restaurant!
I have to hand it to my father-- these hors d’oeuvres are delicious! 
...Are you maybe asking me for a battle? Well, certainly! I never back down from a challenge!
                            
Finally. Now we can go about enjoying our meal without disruption.
Yes! This meal is good enough to serve at the hotel. 
Please don’t tell my date that my father owns the restaurant. I’ll have a battle with you if you keep your mouth shut.
                            
My date did his best, but you were better than the both of us.
Fufufu, my date’s really enjoying my dad’s cooking. She has a dreamy expression after every bite! 
I’m feeling great! Sure, I’ll have a battle with you. That’s why you approached us, right?
                                 
My prowess as a Trainer isn’t up to snuff... It’s not like my father’s scrumptious cooking...
This succulent flavor! It reminds me of a world trip I took. My father and I traveled everywhere dining at only the best restaurants. 
Eating this fabulous meal has really lifted my spirits. Join us for a battle?
                                                        
Your father’s cooking has a very magical quality to it. It seems to perk people up with energy.
If your intention is to test your skill on us, I daresay you ought to bring at least another Pokémon.
Oh, you’re offering to do battle with us? How nice of you. Unfortunately, you simply cannot battle us both with just one Pokémon.
Let me propose a toast to many more happy years together. 
Since I took my retirement, I’ve been traveling with my wife. We both enjoy searching for delicious dining experiences. You seem to enjoy battling with Pokémon. Am I right?
                               
Well, so much for that. Let’s try to enjoy the rest of our meal.
To our health, welfare, and to fine dining! Cheers! 
A toast before a meal helps stimulate the appetite, I find. But that’s neither here nor there. You wanted a battle, surely?
                        
Gourmet dining in restaurants and exhilarating Pokémon battles... There is so much contentment in my life!
Hmm! Now, this is special! It appears as if it were only grazed with fire, but in reality, much care has gone into its preparation! 
When you get to be an accomplished gourmet like myself, one can tell at a glance if a dish is delicious or not. You would battle against such a discerning gourmet?
                                                    
Well, so much for that. We’ll keep a stiff upper lip and look forward to enjoying the main course.
These hors d’oeuvres are simply divine! They tell me that I can expect the main course to be fantastic! 
I thought the main course arrived already... You’re a Trainer seeking battle?
                                                
The hors d’oeuvres were most excellent!
Hmm! The chef flambeed this to perfection! The rich aromas and flavors fill my mouth with joy! 
You’re throwing down a challenge in the middle of our meal? I would say you’re a very dedicated Trainer, especially for one so young!
                                                      
Ah... I’m very satisfied with our meal and our battle.
...! This sauce! It’s a spicy sauce in Hoenn style made from grated Cheri Berries! 
Would you like to sample a bite? ... Oh, right. Pokémon?
                                              
Battling is fine, of course. But for me, I would rather be out enjoying good meals.
If you want to battle us, you have to have two Pokémon.
Don’t you have two Pokémon? We’ll have to battle another time!
Alison, um, I, er... Thank you for coming today... Should we make a toast? 
She’s the girl from the Pokémon-goods shop I go to all the time. We’re incredibly happy together. Would you like to battle us?
                                                   
Oh, no, I’m sorry we lost. Alison, you’re not upset?
Fufu... Eugene, you act so different from the way you do at the shop. You’re surprisingly shy. 
I work at a Pokémon-goods shop because I love Pokémon. The job lets me be with Pokémon all day long. It naturally made me pretty decent at battling. Want to try me?
                                             
I don’t worry much about winning or losing. I keep my Pokémon with me because I love them!
If my Pokémon buddies hear I went on a date with you, Alison... They’re probably going to hate me for it... 
Are you Alison’s fan, too?
                                             
Alison, seeing your smiling face... I can’t tell if these appetizers are delicious or not!
Sorry? What? Date? Um... Eugene... You are a valued customer and all... 
...Even though I said that, I admit the invitation was flattering. So I accepted his invitation. I’ll let my Pokémon decide for my fickle heart. Let’s battle?
                                            
You know, it is true what they say. There is no evil among Pokémon fans! That goes for you and Eugene!
Looks like our main course is here. Please, enjoy yourself. I’ve got the bill covered today! 
I’ll defeat you and collect the prize money!
                                                         
My wallet’s empty after paying the prize money... Oh, no, it’s OK! No need to worry! I still have my secret stash of cash!
Eugene, I think you’re a little awkward, but you’re very earnest. 
If I team up with my date, it could be an interesting combination. I think we could battle in an intriguing manner. Do you?
                                 
The meal was delicious, and our battle was so much fun. I really insist that we split the bill.
If you have two Pokémon, I’ll take you on with my mom.
I’m willing to have a battle with my son, my pride and joy. But you must bring more Pokémon than that.
What should I have today? Juice, ice cream, cake, and, and... 
Oh, hi, Trainer! Want to battle Pokémon with us before we have a yummy meal?
                                         
I don’t get it. Grown-ups always have a toast before eating. What’s that for? And I don’t see any bread?
My dear, Mommy is so proud of you for doing so well on your test. You may order anything you like. It’s your reward, dearest! 
Did you know? My boy is not only a genius at school, but he’s also a Pokémon prodigy! Would you like to challenge us and see?
                                               
I wish to propose a toast. May my darling Esteban get another 100% on a test!
Wow, they bring out things one dish at a time! It’s not like how it is at home! 
I do my homework while eating. I can battle anytime!
                                               
We’re going to eat this delicious stuff now. Bye-bye!
This restaurant is the talk of the town for the delicious food. 
I beg your pardon? You want a battle now? Well, that’s all right. It’s not as if I dislike it.
                                 
Thank you for letting my dear son experience an invaluable lesson.
Do mothers and fathers go off to eat like this? I mean without taking their kids along. 
But that’s OK. It’s way more fun for me to battle than go eat fancy dinners!
                                                  
Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
This is a special occasion, Esteban. This is to celebrate your great grades! 
Oh? A battle, you say? Well, certainly. Why not?
                                               
Is the dessert coming soon?
My daughter and I always battle together, none of that one-on-one.
I can go against you with Papa. Please bring more Pokémon.
Here’s a toast for Mom. May she always be healthy! 
My wife’s in the hospital waiting for the baby to arrive. Since I can’t cook, I came here with my daughter. How would you like a battle with us before we eat?
                         
The house will be a lot noisier when the baby comes home with Mommy.
I wonder what Mommy will bring home? A baby boy? A baby girl? 
A boy will be a brother, and a girl will be a sister. I’m going to be the older sister, so I should get better at Pokémon!
                            
Little babies cry like Pokémon! Piyaaaah!
Wow... Look at these appetizers. This is just so extravagant. 
I’m no cook, I’ll admit that freely. But battling Pokémon... There’s something I’m comfortable with.
                            
Let’s get over the sting of this loss by enjoying this delicious meal!
Wow! This food looks really fancy! 
Papa is a rotten cook, so we can go out and eat good food like this! Did you come to this restaurant to battle Pokémon?
               
I’ve never eaten anything like this before.
Here’s the main dish! 
What is it? Did you want to battle with us?
              
Jocelyn, I hope the new baby will be as kindhearted as you.
I wish Mommy were here to eat with us... 
Mommy gave me my Pokémon. Want to see how tough they are?
                            
Next time, let’s come with everyone. The baby, too!
Yeah? What’s up? Did you want to be on TV, too? Oh, right, sorry! You wanted to battle! You’ll be battling the two of us. You need at least two Pokémon.
If you want an autograph, you’ll have to wait till we finish filming. Oh, and if you want to battle, bring two Pokémon, OK?
Let’s start with a shot of the drinks as a camera test. 
Hunh? You’re inviting us to battle at a time like this?
                                          
Oh, man... Our drinks are lukewarm now.
Today’s featured drink is freshly squeezed juice made from ripened Pecha Berries picked this morning! 
Pardon? Pokémon? OK, a quick one before we do any filming for the show.
                                             
Do you think we should rehearse this one more time? Today’s featured drink is freshly squeezed...
Hey, these appetizers sure do look delicious. Will someone bring me a mist spray so they look even fresher? 
Thanks, that was quick! ...Wait, where’s the mist spray? Oh, you want a battle? Whatever, then. I’m up for your challenge!
                                                             
Photographing food isn’t easy. It’s actually very technical.
These look fabulous, too. We need the camera to zoom in more! 
Please don’t talk to me while we’re filming! Oh, actually, hold on. A Trainer barges in on our fine-dining experience... I like that! It adds drama to our story!
                               
Darling Darryl, are you ready? When I take a bite, I want a close-up of my lips, all right?
Whoa... So this is the main dish? Yowza! Let’s get this filming done quick so I can chow down, too! 
You’ve been sniffing around a lot... Are you messing with our filming?
                                          
Oh, no... Everything’s gone cold while we were battling...
Chomp! Mmm... This is... Light, and yet rich flavored... It delectably melts away... A hint of an aftertaste, yet crisp... Neither too sweet nor too bitter... My words can’t do this justice! 
It’s not easy trying to describe food while you’re eating. But I can battle anytime during filming!
                                                                                                   
Do you know what the most important thing is for gourmet reporting? It’s a...thesaurus-like vocabulary!
I’ll only say this once, so listen closely. I’ll even say it slowly. To battle against two Trainers, you need two or more Pokémon. Now if you were to bring more Pokémon, I could consider a battle...
Oh, you’ll have to bring more Pokémon than that to battle us!
And another brilliant day on the markets! A toast to my Lady Luck! 
Since I’ve been with her, I’ve been riding a hot streak on the markets. I’m surfing on a wave of good luck! You’re sure you want to battle us?
                            
This is just a minor setback. I can easily make up for this!
Ooh! All your stocks went up again? You haven’t guessed wrong yet! 
My boyfriend’s a stock-market wizard! Did you know? Someone that lucky also happens to make a tough Trainer. Are you willing to try your luck against that?
                          
It’s just one loss. We can make that back with a big win next time!
There’s no need for technique. You just have to read what’s in your opponent’s heart. 
When I say “heart,” I don’t mean what that person’s thinking. It’s about how they want to be perceived. Do you... Would you like me to think of you as a tough Trainer?
                               
I had a bad feeling about this Trainer...
No, really? Ooeeeh! That is so neat! How can you tell these things? 
My boyfriend could tell that deep down, I’m actually a frightened and lonely child! I don’t think I could ever lose with him. Want to try?
                            
It’s amazing that you predicted you would lose!
Let’s savor this extravagant meal and think of what it represents. We can use that as motivation to keep winning at life! 
Personally, I think there are two kinds of people. Those who face up to challenges and those who duck and cover. You’re the type who accepts challenges, am I right?
                                        
If I had the power of premonition, I’d be a terror on the markets. But you know that’s not really possible.
How can you guess right about everything all the time? Do you really have the power of premonition? 
I’m convinced that he has some extrasensory power or something. I’m teaming up with a guy like that. Are you sure you want to do this?
                                         
If it’s not premonition, did you... Maybe come from the future?
One Pokémon is insufficient if you want to battle against us.
If you’d bring two or more Pokémon, we could have a battle with you.
Hmm... This beverage’s coloration borders on the positively toxic... However, my analysis indicates that it is composed of natural ingredients. 
What is it? You are? ... ...Oh, yes, a Trainer.
                                                               
The results of that battle are insignificant. Let’s drink up.
Oh, dear! I wish you wouldn’t! We’re at a fancy restaurant, and you want to analyze what’s served? 
Oh, you’re a Trainer?
                                                        
Cheers, dear! Please don’t start analyzing what we just drank!
Interesting... These hors d’oeuvres are fascinating. Plant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%. Curious and curiouser... 
What is it now? Do you want me to analyze your skill level?
                                                             
I feel compelled to analyze that which is unknown to me. By defining its composition, I feel reassured in my knowledge.
Oh, dear, must you go on that way? It takes the magic out of a meal. I wish you wouldn’t think about your research while we’re out eating! 
My husband never ceases to amaze me with his dedication to research. Would you care to have a battle with us?
                                                      
If you were to ask me, I would rather not know about what I don’t understand. It’s simpler that way.
By my calculations, the main dish should have arrived by now. Perhaps the thermal setting is too low to prepare the food efficiently? 
You there! Let’s battle to consume time!
                                                            
They brought the main course while we were battling... The calorie content appears to be alarmingly high.
There isn’t any point getting impatient over the food, dear. Isn’t this the sort of situation that you brought your Pokémon for? 
Oh, what good timing! Would you join us for a quick battle?
                                                       
Oh, dear, if we take in too many calories, we can always work them off by battling!

Thanks for helping me out. Here’s something for your trouble! 
Blow the White Flute if you want to attract more wild Pokémon. It’s a rare glass flute you can only get in the Hoenn region.

Hi! I’m the game director! Oh! You’re working on filling a Pokédex! I hope you’ll come show me your Pokédex when you’ve filled it up more!
Hi! I’m the game director! Oh! You’ve seen every Pokémon in Sinnoh! That’s excellent! Let me give you an award!
Hi! I’m the game director! Whoa-oh-oh! This is awesome! You’ve finally obtained every Pokémon there is in the world! Your Pokédex is completed! That’s outstanding work! The effort you went through getting this Pokédex together... Please allow me to honor you with an award!
How did you meet all the Pokémon that filled your Pokédex? Did you work long and hard to catch and raise them? Did you receive them as gifts from friends? Maybe you got some in trades from around the world? Though everyone’s Pokédexes may look the same, the stories they contain are all unique.

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! What, you finally come along now? Slooow! Way too slow! Listen, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. See how the rocks are all lumpy here? You can’t climb those rocks until you get the Snowpoint Gym Badge. Anyway, I’m off. Team Galactic! I’m coming for you! 
We’re here to make sure Snowpoint’s Gym Leader doesn’t disturb us!
You’re here to see the lake Pokémon, too? You must be bored to fight your way through the snow to get here...
Standing guard is a very important assignment! I’ll make this a success and earn myself a CLEFAIRY!
The Pokémon of the three lakes appear to be connected somehow. When they blew up Lake Valor, a cavern appeared in the middle of this lake!
Lake Acuity ahead

I do beg your pardon. Well, we can look forward to how [VAR(259, 0, 0)] will beautify this Villa! This report came to you live from the Resort Area.

There you have it: [VAR(259, 0, 0)] is a Trainer we should all aspire to be. This report came to you live from the Resort Area.

See ya.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Newscaster: We bring you this news flash. We’ve just received word that [VAR(256, 1, 0)] has been spotted in the vicinity of [VAR(260, 0, 0)]. If you’ve ever had the desire to see [VAR(256, 1, 0)]...

Reporter: I’m bringing you this report from the second floor of Jubilife TV. I’m here to examine a recently added photo titled “[VAR(284, 1, 0)],” which belongs to [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Oh, is this it here? Let’s see... The title “[VAR(284, 1, 0)]” does sound fitting for this photo... But one can’t help but think perhaps a better title could have been found. All controversy aside, it’s certainly worth seeing. Please do visit!

Hello! It’s time for We Love the GTS! The show for fans of the GTS! Excuse me! Did you just make a trade? Can we get a word, please? ...Huh? Me? Are you talking to me? Um, it makes me happy knowing I can always trade for what I want here. But there is something that does bother me sometimes. It’s about the moves some traded Pokémon know. I mean, this one’s moves are Explosion, Cut, Double-Edge, and Reversal. Like, what a weird set. Is there any meaning behind this? Well, isn’t that a neat story! It must mean something to someone! That’s all until next week!
I was just your average girl until I was literally stricken by a ThunderShock. It was love at first sight, baby! And my target, a Gym Leader! I didn’t have any Pokémon then, but not a problem for a resourceful gal! The answer was simple! And we all know simple is best! I just had to become a Trainer. That’s all it took for me! “The Diary of a Poké Romantic” will soon make its debut! The pilot episode: “Love at First Sight! The Rules of the Move Attract!” By the way, how did everyone get their first Pokémon anyway?
After some fits and starts, a childhood friend gave me my first Pokémon! ...But it was a KRICKETOT. When I don’t like the legs of bugs... I bet he gave me this because I picked on him when he was little... But though the road has been long and hard, I’m finally at the starting line! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 2! “The Maiden in Love and the KRICKETOT. The Magic of Romance Never Ends!” Oh, this KRICKETOT is a female. Maybe we can be friends.
I checked out my KRICKETOT and learned about its moves. ...It only knows Growl and Bide. That’s worse than just challenging! I was about to say that, when my childhood friend stopped me. “Let it hold an Oran Berry so that it can survive while using Bide.” Hey, that’s smart! That’s from a former Bug Catcher! While we’re at it, can I have an Oran Berry, too? Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 3! “Love Conquers All. Covering Weakness with Ideas!” We’re a Trainer and Pokémon now! We’ll get stronger together!
I had my first ever Pokémon battle, and it ended badly... My childhood friend, a former Bug Catcher, had this to say. “Pokémon get tougher by battling. The key to victory is type matchups.” Type matchups? Types affect battles? The only type matchup I care about is with that Gym Leader! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 4! “Type Matchups Settle Battles! Moves That Exploit Weak Points!” Fire, Flying, and Rock... KRICKETOT has some disadvantages!
We’d win a battle, and lose one. Lose one, then win one. Though it was discouraging, I had to keep battling to toughen us up. With me and KRICKETOT, it was always three steps forward, two steps back. But we were getting stronger. Then one day, KRICKETOT started to shine! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 5! “KRICKETOT Becomes KRICKETUNE! Watch Me! I’ll Change, Too!” And, to cancel evolution, press the B Button... Tell me that first!
After KRICKETOT evolved, she became stronger as KRICKETUNE. We also got other Pokémon, so we could go farther and farther from home. But where is my beloved Gym Leader? Where is that city he said he’s from? I do have the Town Map, but maps baffle me. It doesn’t matter, though. If we keep moving, we’ll get somewhere. Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 6! “How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms Can’t Be Found Everywhere!” The more lost you are, the less useful a map becomes! You know it’s true!
Our journey was long, and it was hard. But no one wants to hear that! So, I finally found my Gym Leader. But, he has an incurable disease! He begged me, out of the blue, with his last wish. He asked for my Pokémon! But my KRICKETUNE’s my partner! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 7! “My Trail of Footprints Shortened the Distance Between Us!” Every time I see KRICKETUNE’s face, I get reminded of our time together...
My beloved Gym Leader, whom I fought so hard to meet, was a fraud! How dare he con this pure maiden! How dare he toy with my emotions! But whose fault was it? Was it mine to be taken in? All I know is that my tears overflow, and despair is my world... Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode 8! “KRICKETUNE and I! Our Bond Is True!” That Gym Leader’s eating a Giga Impact for playing me for a fool!
Having defeated the fake Gym Leader, KRICKETUNE and I stood in a daze. We were spent. Drained by a romance that ended as a nightmare. It was then my childhood friend, the former Bug Catcher, arrived. He did more than that. He confessed his love to me! “I wanted to become an Elite Four member so I quit as a Gym Leader. “But, then, that faker appeared. You took care of him, though!” Wait, ex-Bug Catcher! What? What are you saying?! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” final episode! “Do it, KRICKETUNE! Silver Wind over Sinnoh Skies!” You were laughing at me for falling for that fraud, weren’t you?

This bright red Berry is very spicy and has a provocative flavor. It blooms with delicate, pretty flowers.
This Berry’s thick skin and fruit are very tough and dry tasting. However, every bit of it can be eaten.
Because of its hollow inside pocket, there isn’t a lot to eat. What can be eaten is very sweet and delicious.
If the leaves grow longer and curlier than average, this Berry will have a somewhat-bitter taste.
This Berry’s peel is hard, but the flesh inside is very juicy. It is distinguished by its bracing sourness.
It takes longer to grow than Berries such as Cheri. The smaller Berries taste better.
Nature’s gifts came together as one in this Berry. It has a wondrous mix of flavors that spread in the mouth.
The more this Berry absorbs energy from sunlight, the more vividly colorful it grows.
This Berry’s gradual process of storing nutrients beneficial to Pokémon health causes it to mature slowly.
Sitrus came from the same family as Oran. It is larger and smoother tasting than Oran.
This Berry is oddly shaped, appearing as if someone took a bite out of it. It is packed full of spicy substances.
It is said that this Berry grew lumps to help Pokémon grip it, allowing propagation farther afield.
This Berry progressively curves as it grows. The curvier the Berry, the sweeter and tastier.
This Berry turns bitter toward the stem. The dainty flower it grows from doesn’t absorb much sunlight.
This Berry is very big and sour. The juiciness of the pulp accentuates the sourness.
A small hint of spiciness lingers in the red granules surrounding this Berry. Their centers have a dry taste.
Though this small, delicately skinned Berry is blue in color, it dyes the mouth black when eaten.
Bitter, but with a trace of sweetness, the Nanab Berry was the seventh to be discovered in the world.
The potent mix of bitter and sour in this Berry seems to promote digestion. The flower is white and beautiful.
It is said that when the sour skin is peeled, this spicy Berry can be crushed to make medicine.
When this sweetly spicy Berry’s thick skin is peeled, many pieces of the fruit spill out.
This Berry can be eaten as is or boiled to obtain an extract that adds a dash of flavor to food.
Even in places of constant rain and high humidity, this Berry’s plant grows healthy and strong.
This somewhat-rare Berry projects an image of luxury, so it is favored as a gift item.
One bite of this very tender Berry fills the mouth with its sweet and tangy flavor.
This Berry is large and spicy. When eaten during the cold season, it warms the body from inside.
Its dryness is quite strong. As a result, its true deliciousness can’t be appreciated by just eating one or two.
The grown-up flavor and dreamy sweetness of this Berry make it a favorite of Pokémon everywhere.
Even though it is bitter, it should be eaten peel and all. The hair on the peel cleans the stomach from the inside.
This Berry is quite sour overall, with the sourness especially concentrated at the pointed end.
So spicy is the Spelon Berry that, Fire type or not, Pokémon will try to breathe fire after eating a single one.
This Berry drifted from a faraway sea. It is now cultivated in the Sinnoh region.
A bounty of nature that is exceedingly sweet. The Berry is huge, with some discovered that exceed 20 inches.
This Berry is tremendously bitter. Just one bite is enough to instantly stop hiccups.
This glossy and colorful Berry has a mouthwateringly delicious appearance. However, it is awfully sour.
This Berry is said to have grown plentiful in the tropics of the past. It boasts an intensely hot spiciness.
This Berry’s flesh is dotted with countless tiny bubbles of air that keep it afloat in water.
Energy from lightning strikes is drawn into the plant, making the Berries grow big and rich.
This Berry has a disagreeable “green” flavor and scent typical of vegetables. It is rich in health-promoting fiber.
This Berry has a refreshing flavor that strikes a good balance of dryness and sourness. It tastes better chilled.
This Berry contains a substance that generates heat. It can even heat up a chilly heart.
This Berry is a brilliant green on the outside. Inside, it is packed with a dry-flavored, black-colored flesh.
The sweetness-laden pulp has just the hint of a hard-edged and fragrant bite to it.
This Berry is said to be a new kind that is a cross of two Berries brought together by winds from far away.
This Berry is said to sense human emotions for the way it swells roundly when a person approaches.
The flower grows at the tip of this Berry. It attracts Bug Pokémon by letting its stringy petals stream out.
It is often used for pickles because of its very dry flavor. It can also be eaten raw for its provocative taste.
Considered to have a special power from the olden days, this Berry is sometimes dried and used as a good-luck charm.
If a large enough volume of this Berry is boiled down, its bitterness fades away. It makes a good jam.
Tiny hooks grow on the surface of this Berry. It latches on to Pokémon so it can be carried to far-off places.
This Berry is very tough with a strong flavor. It was used to make medicine by people in the past.
This Berry can be cored out and dried to make a whistle. Blowing through its hole makes an indescribable sound.
This Berry is surrounded by mystery. It is rumored to be imbued with the power of the sea.
This Berry is surrounded by mystery. It is rumored to be imbued with the power of the land.
This Berry is surrounded by mystery. It is rumored to be imbued with the power of the sky.
This Berry is surrounded by mystery. It is rumored to be imbued with the power of all living things.
This is a very, very mystifying Berry. There is no telling how it can be used, or what may happen if it is used.
This is said to be a legendary Berry. Holding it supposedly brings great joy.
This Berry is considered a mirage. It was said to be so strong that it had to be abandoned at the world’s edge.
A completely enigmatic Berry. It apparently has the power of the stars that fill the night sky.
This Berry has a very dry flavor. It has the effect of making other food eaten at the same time taste sweet.
The flesh underneath the Custap Berry’s tough skin is sweet and creamy soft.
The cluster of drupelets that make up this Berry pop rhythmically if the Berry is handled roughly.
In days of old, people worked the top- shaped pieces of this Berry free and used them as toys.

You haven’t caught all your Pokémon yet, but... Would you like to retire from your Catching Show?
I see... I’m disappointed that you dropped out. Make up for it next time! 
That’s the spirit, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I like how you don’t give up!
That’s the spirit, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I like how you don’t give up!
                                    
Ding-dong! Congratulations! [VAR(259, 0, 0)] has successfully caught the stocked Pokémon! 
                                     
                                       
Would you like to retire?
Let the countdown begin!
Three...
Two...
One...
Start!

Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. You can choose first. Go ahead. You know, like, I’m gonna be a man about it. Yeah, I’m slick.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: That Pokémon battle... Wasn’t that wickedly fun or what? I mean, I’d pick the moves, and my Pokémon would use them! Yeah, I’m going to battle tons and get real close with Pokémon.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Pokémon all have different moves, huh? A Trainer makes his Pokémon battle by ordering them to use moves. That’s so awesomely cool.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Do you believe it? I can hardly believe it. You and me, we’re Pokémon Trainers all of a sudden. Man, we’ve got tons to learn about being a Trainer. But seeing this Poké Ball with this [VAR(256, 1, 0)] inside... It makes me feel like I can do anything! Nothing’s impossible!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: That lake has a mirage Pokémon living in it. Everyone says it’s just a legend, but I know I’m right.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Hey, do you know about the Champion? There’s this out-of-this-world tough Trainer who gets called that. Well, I’m gonna get so tough, the Champ has to battle me. You watch! With this little guy here, I’m sure I can get that tough.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Hey, that’s enough talking already. I’m itching to get going to the lake. Come on, come on!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: All right! Let’s move out! Hustle up!
                                                          
                                                        
                                                
Cheryl: It’s startling to see two wild Pokémon appearing at the same time.
Cheryl: My Pokémon is an excellent healer. But attacking isn’t its strong point.
Cheryl: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], battling with you makes me feel elated. If I could predict what you’re about to do, we would make a fierce combo!
Cheryl: That’s some nice moss...
Mira: Are you going to use that? I will be left all alone...
Mira: Are you going to use that? I will be left all alone...
Mira: That isn’t the right way. I’ll be lost if we go down...
Mira: I like helpful Pokémon moves like Growl and Minimize. Those kinds of moves are my favorites.
Mira: This cave... It’s so easy to get confused here. Do you know where we are?
Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], did you get to be so good because you’re always with your Pokémon? Yes! That has to be it! I will try like you!
Riley: If you use that, I’ll have to wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: If you use that move, I’ll have to wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: Haha, I’d have to agree. People training here would be those with too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly thriving ore mine once upon a time. I guess the steel ore’s played out. There’s only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron? The Leader of Canalave Gym? He’s asked me to become a Gym Leader, but there’s his son Roark to consider as well.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like for a Steel-type Pokémon user to battle a Steel type. Would that be like battling yourself, I wonder? I mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat one’s self than anyone else.
Riley: What’s going on here, though? The native Pokémon are restless... I don’t like this... Let’s hurry.
Riley: Thanks. You really helped me out. Listen, I have a Pokémon here named Luca. Would you take it with you? 
Riley: Thanks! I want you to show Luca all sorts of worlds. 
Riley: Thank you... But you don’t have room to take another Pokémon. All right, then. I’ll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you’ll accept it as a token of our friendship.
Riley: Spending time with you was very enjoyable. I intend to test my skills in other places from now on. It would be great if we could meet again. 
Marley: ...Are you going to leave me here?
Marley: ...Are you going to leave me here?
Marley: ...Sorry, but I’m not going up.
Marley: ...It isn’t that way.
Marley: ...You’re very chatty...
Marley: ...The Pokémon among flowers...
Buck: Whoa, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! If you use that, me and my Pokémon will be left behind. Don’t do it!
Buck: Whoa, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! If you use that, me and my Pokémon will be left behind. Don’t do it!
Buck: This is where I raised my Pokémon. I can’t stand the thought of anyone making a mess of this place. Especially not those weird Team Galactic goons!
Buck: There’s no law that says I have to be tough or anything, but losing isn’t fair to my Pokémon. After all, they try so hard for me. I think it’s my responsibility as a Trainer to recognize their hard work.
Buck: My big brother’s one of the Elite Four. So, of course it’s only normal that I’d be better than ordinary folks. But that’s not what I want. I want to be tough on my own terms. It wouldn’t be fair to the Pokémon that chose to be with me.
Buck: It might be cool being a Gym Leader or one of the Elite Four... But, then again, it sounds like it’d be a lot of hard work!

Hello! Here you may cook Berries and turn them into Poffins. 
Would you like to cook alone or with other people?
DS Wireless Communications will be launched.
YES
NO
               
There isn’t a Berry to cook! 
The Poffin Case is full. 
Sorry, you must have a Poffin Case if you want to cook some Berries.

One person in the group needs to choose “BECOME LEADER.” Everyone else must choose “JOIN GROUP.”
        
       
   
                             
                          
  
   
                 
  
   
            
  
   
                       
                    
                
                                                       
                                      
Throw the Berry into the pot and get stirring! Watch for an arrow to show you which direction to stir. Be quick! If you stir too slowly, you’ll burn the batter. But not too quick! If you stir too fast, the batter will overflow. If you do well, you’ll cook up a delicious Poffin! You may cook alone or in a group of up to four people. With more cooks stirring, everyone will get more Poffins!
Please visit again whenever you get the urge to cook!

Could it be...? [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...?
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]! How awful!
I was confident about [VAR(284, 0, 0)], too.
You’re [VAR(284, 0, 0)], aren’t you?

Wild Pokémon lurk in tall grass. They can come bursting out at any time. So, if you’re wanting to battle wild Pokémon, just walk in tall grass. If you want to avoid wild Pokémon, then stay out of the tall grass.
Hi! I work at a Pokémon Mart. Did you know that a Pokémon’s health is measured by Hit Points (HP)? If a Pokémon runs out of HP, it faints and can’t battle anymore. If a Pokémon’s HP gets low, you should heal it with a Potion. Here, let me give you a Potion as a free sample. First one’s free! It will automatically go in the Medicine Pocket of your Bag. 
You can find a Pokémon Mart in cities and most major towns.
That ledge is one way. Jump down for a shortcut to Twinleaf Town!
If your Pokémon’s health--that’s its HP--is getting low, you should go home and get some rest.
If your Pokémon’s health--that’s its HP--is getting low, you should go to a Pokémon Center!

Dawn: Oh, that’s right! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], I haven’t shown you how to catch a Pokémon. I’ll demonstrate how to catch  one, so just watch me, OK? 
Dawn: Giggle... See? Isn’t it neat? Actually, it’s better to lower your target’s HP more than I did. It’s important to get the Pokémon’s HP down as low as possible. This is because a healthy Pokémon is very difficult to catch. Oh, Pokémon also get easier to catch if you make them sleep or something by using a Pokémon’s move. OK, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], to get you started, I’ll give you five Poké Balls!

Lucas: And that’s how it’s done. Actually, I should have lowered the target’s HP some more. Yup, the important thing is to lower the Pokémon’s HP as much as possible. See, a healthy Pokémon isn’t easy to catch. Oh, yeah. They also get easier to catch if you make one of your Pokémon put them to sleep or such.

Dawn: See? Did you notice the tall grass rustling? There’s a Pokémon in that patch of tall grass. If you go there, the Pokémon will come bursting out. 
Now, this is where it gets interesting. If you see another patch of rustling grass some distance away, go into it. You’ll see the same kind of Pokémon as before. If you want to keep meeting the same kind of Pokémon, you should maybe use some Repels. 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. Let me explain how the Poké Radar works. Let’s give it a go. When you use the Poké Radar...

Are you raising different kinds of Pokémon? If you only have the same type of Pokémon, you’ll have a hard time against types it’s weak to.
Hi, are you the flirty type? I’m asking you this to make a point. I teach at the Trainers’ School, and I’d like to give you a lesson. But before I do, I’d like you to have this TM. 
You know how Pokémon have genders? Like, there are males and females? Well, the move Captivate only works against the opposite gender. For example, it only works when used by a male Pokémon on a female. The move sharply lowers the target’s Special Attack, or Sp. Atk for short. You also probably know this, but a TM is good for only one use. Choose the Pokémon wisely if you do decide to use it.

Trainer Tips After a Berry is planted, watch the color of the soil. If the soil is dark, it means it has plenty of moisture. If the soil is lighter in color, water it with your Sprayduck.

Everyone seems to call me the Berry Master. I hand out Berries daily because I want people to learn how wonderful they are. You’re deserving of one! 
Berries are gifts of nature. I encourage you to feed Berries to Pokémon. That will make Pokémon happy. Seeing that, people will be motivated to plant more Berries. And that will make Sinnoh a greener, more natural place.
Are you the forgetful type who forgets where Berries are planted?
Yes, yes, I thought so! I’m the same way! I feel a sort of kinship with you! You can have this Pokétch app! 
Oh, is that so. Then you’re OK even if I don’t give you this nice thing.

It’s a book titled “Much Ado About Mulch: A Berry-Grower’s Guide.” 
Which kind of Mulch would you like to read about?
The Growth Mulch promotes faster growth of Berries. However, it also causes the soil to dry faster as well. More frequent watering is recommended. 
The Damp Mulch slows the drying of soil. However, it also slows the growth of Berries. 
The Stable Mulch extends the time Berries remain on their plants. Some growers use it in hard-to-reach locations that may be overlooked for harvesting. 
The Gooey Mulch increases the growth cycles of Berries. This means the number of times new plants grow from where mature plants have withered is increased.

Wah! You startled me good! I think you’ll understand what I was doing when you see this TM. 
Let me explain how that move works without getting too technical. Let’s say your opponent raises its Defense using Harden. Your Pokémon can use Psych Up to get the same Defense boost as its foe. Basically, your Pokémon gets the same status boosts as its target.

Mr. Backlot in the Pokémon Mansion  looks forward to seeing visitors. He must be able to wait around because he wants to brag about something.
There are good trees that you can smear with Honey, and some you can’t. If you want to lure rare Pokémon, you have to find an attractive tree.
Why, hello there! It’s nice to have an average citizen say hi to us Policemen!
Patrols day and night... I’m feeling drowsy... Yawn...
Yo! Working hard at it, Trainer?

Mr. Backlot is the master of this mansion. This is his office.
This is the way out to the trophy garden. The garden is open for all visitors to enjoy. However, please beware--wild Pokémon may appear in the garden.
Welcome. Here, you may challenge the mansion’s pride--the five Trainer maids. The challenge is to beat all five of us in a row without a break. In addition to beating us, if you can beat us in a specific number of turns, there will be a special gift. Incidentally, a turn refers to the time it takes for a Trainer and the opponent to each make an action. In this case, action refers to making a Pokémon use a move, using an item, or switching a Pokémon. And now... 
The 5-Maid Knockout Exact-Turn Attack Challenge! Today’s targeted number of turns is [VAR(308, 0, 0)]! Would you like to try?
Oh, how disappointing... Please take the challenge sometime.
Very well! Our first maid, please! 
Congratulations! You have defeated four maids so far. You have taken [VAR(308, 1, 0)] turns up to now. The target is [VAR(308, 0, 0)] turns. 
Congratulations for your sweep. The targeted number of turns was [VAR(308, 0, 0)]. The number of turns you needed to defeat the maids was [VAR(308, 1, 0)]. 
How splendid of you! You hit the target! For making the sweep in the targeted number of turns, a special gift! The chance to battle our very own prodigy, Master Liam! 
How splendid of you! You hit the target! For making the sweep in the targeted number of turns, a special gift! The chance to battle our very own prodigy, Lady Celeste! 
Your splendor is authentic! Sweeping the floor with the five maids wasn’t enough for you, oh no! Why, to think you would triumph over even our Master Liam! 
Your splendor is authentic! Sweeping the floor with the five maids wasn’t enough for you, oh no! Why, to think you would triumph over even our Lady Celeste! 
Ooh... How disappointing for you. That said, you swept the five maids. That’s plenty to be proud of! 
Please visit again tomorrow.
I’m so sorry. Everything beyond this point is strictly off-limits. Please, you really mustn’t. Mr. Backlot will be so cross with me!
First up! My favorite color is blue! I will open the proceedings! 
The next person up is quite strong, really. 
I’m pleased to meet you in battle. My best color is green! 
I was no. 2, and a little bit tough! The next maid is even tougher! 
My lucky color is yellow! The sunshine girl! That’s me! 
The next maid is a wee bit stronger than I am. 
Pink is the color I can’t do without! I’m the fourth in line! 
Th-the next maid up is really strong! 
My symbolic color is red! Prepare for no. 5! 
You knocked out the five of us! You have to be splendid! 
A Trainer would come here and pull me into a battle...? I never expected this, but I may as well enjoy it, don’t you think? 
Wonderful! You’re a marvel of a Trainer! Oh, I’ll ask you not to pry into what I’m doing in the back of the mansion. This knowing wink is all you’ll get out of me. 
Oh, my... You must show me how good you are for the ladies to call me out. 
Oh, my! My, my, my! Your technique was most enchanting. I will take my leave now. Giggle...

I’m not loafing. I’m just taking a personal break. It’s my official policy to sleep in a bed when I’m officially loafing.

Backlot: Hello, hello! Welcome to my opulent mansion! There’s a lot for me to be proud of inside, and outside, of this home... But what makes me the most proud is my trophy garden in the back! Why bother traveling afar when Pokémon are attracted by my garden? They come to me in hopes of seeing the garden! You’re welcome to join them and marvel at my garden!
                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                      
Backlot: Er-hem! There’s a lot for me to be proud of inside, and outside, of this home... But what makes me the most proud is my trophy garden in the back! Why bother traveling afar when Pokémon are attracted by my garden? They come to me in hopes of seeing the garden! Well, doesn’t that make you envious? You are envious, yes?
I know you’re really envious... You’re not fooling anyone...
Backlot: Muhohoho... I bet you are! I knew you would be! But I don’t mind! I enjoy sharing my stories with you! So! When I go out into my prized trophy garden, Pokémon come running to me. They sidle up, as happy as they can be to see me! Well? Doesn’t that make you envious? You are envious, yes?
Backlot: Muhohoho... I bet you are! I knew you would be! But I don’t mind! I enjoy sharing my stories with you! So! This is what happened this morning when I went into my trophy garden. I noticed a cute-eyed [VAR(256, 0, 0)], which joyously ran over to me. The [VAR(256, 0, 0)] ran up and gave me a smooch on my cheek... 
Butler: M-Master! Th-that Pokémon you mentioned... It doesn’t exist in the garden... 
Backlot: Wha... Erm... Wh-what are you saying? I’m no blowhard! Listen... Mutter, mutter... Whisper, whisper... 
Butler: Yes, Master! Right away, sir! 
Backlot: ...It’s true, I tell you! No lies ever leave these lips! There really are cute [VAR(256, 0, 0)] in my trophy garden! Honest truth!
Butler: Master is a truly wonderful and generous person! It’s on his orders that the garden, his pride and joy, is open to all, even Trainers.
Butler: Master actually quite enjoys showing his prized garden to strong Trainers.
Butler: Master took a stroll in his trophy garden today, like usual.
Butler: Did you see them? There were some [VAR(256, 0, 0)], weren’t there? But that’s only to be expected. It’s Master’s trophy garden.
Butler: How do you find it? Master’s upgraded trophy garden, I mean. You did notice the influx of quite rare Pokémon, yes? But that’s only to be expected. It’s Master’s trophy garden.
You may look, but please refrain from touching this Pokémon statue.
I’m very sorry. But please refrain from touching this statue. 
It’s a very expensive-looking Pokémon statue... ...! You got fingerprints on it...
It’s a very expensive-looking book on Pokémon. Would you like to read it?

If you’d share your shards with me, I can teach your Pokémon some moves. Would you like me to teach a move?
See you, then!
Which Pokémon should I teach? 
There are no moves that can be taught to this Pokémon.
You don’t have enough shards.
Which move should be taught to [VAR(257, 0, 0)]?

Stop trying to teach [VAR(262, 1, 0)]?
[VAR(257, 0, 0)] did not learn the move [VAR(262, 1, 0)]. 
Is it OK to forget the move [VAR(262, 1, 0)]?

My daddy collects shards. If you find any, like in the Underground, please bring them to us.
My daddy likes Blue Shards. There are other people who like shards in Sinnoh. One person likes Red Shards. Another collects Yellow Shards.
Red Shards emphasize power. Blue Shards are for special effects. Yellow Shards are for status problems. Blue Shards are the ones for me!

Oh, no, no, no! How did I miss it? Ah, Looker, this time you have made a mistake of the ages! The man, who I have seen running away, he was the bearer of the bomb! 
Ach! This will not do! Wait! Wait, I say!

Dr. Footstep’s House Footprints Reveal All

===============================
Text File: 496
===============================
Footprints are left in the sand when you walk on a beach. Pokémon seem to enjoy leaving footprints as much as people.
Listen, do you know about the Battle Frontier?
I guess you’re someone who’s in the know. I hear it’s a fun place with facilities for battling through under different sets of rules.
I guess you’re someone who’s kind of out of the loop. I hear it’s a fun place with facilities for battling consecutively under different sets of rules.

===============================
Dr. Footstep: Pokémon are quite easy for me to read. I need only to see their footprints, and their innermost thoughts are revealed to me! Oh? You are skeptical of my claim? Then, let your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] walk in front of me, right here. From its footprints, I will determine how it feels about you. 
Dr. Footstep: Do you want to check the feelings of your Pokémon again? Then, let your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] walk in front of me, right here. From its footprints, I will determine how it feels about you. 
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] thinks of you.
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmmm... [VAR(256, 0, 0)] doesn’t leave any footprints. It’s somewhat difficult for me to determine what its thoughts are.
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... [VAR(256, 0, 0)] happens to be quite the silent type!
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] thinks of you. I must say, your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] and you share a very close bond. This is for you. 
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmmm... [VAR(256, 0, 0)] doesn’t leave any footprints. It’s somewhat difficult for me to determine what its thoughts are. However, your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] and you obviously share a close bond. This is for you. 
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... [VAR(256, 0, 0)] happens to be quite the silent type! However, your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] and you obviously share a close bond. This is for you. 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] received the Footprint Ribbon. 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] put the Footprint Ribbon on [VAR(256, 0, 0)].
Aww... [VAR(259, 1, 0)] only plays with other Pokémon... [VAR(257, 2, 0)] feels neglected... Maybe [VAR(259, 1, 0)] doesn’t like [VAR(257, 2, 0)] very much? [VAR(257, 2, 0)] will try harder for [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. Please be nicer to me! 
Others say there are people who aren’t very nice to Pokémon. I wonder about [VAR(259, 1, 0)]... Will [VAR(259, 1, 0)] look after [VAR(257, 2, 0)] nicely? Will I get to go all over with this Trainer? Can we be... Friends? 
This adventure with [VAR(259, 1, 0)] is lots of fun. [VAR(257, 2, 0)] gets to go places where I can’t go by myself. I get to battle Pokémon I’ve never ever seen before. I’m gonna get stronger and stronger for [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! 
[VAR(257, 2, 0)] and [VAR(259, 1, 0)] make a perfectly matched combo! I’ve seen all sorts of people so far... But [VAR(259, 1, 0)] understands [VAR(257, 2, 0)]’s feelings most! I’m a little hungry... You can tell, right? 
If I said there can be friendship between Pokémon and people, will [VAR(256, 0, 0)]’s friends understand? But if you see [VAR(259, 1, 0)] and [VAR(257, 2, 0)], you will understand. Because [VAR(259, 1, 0)] and [VAR(257, 2, 0)] are friends! 
[VAR(257, 2, 0)] is bored... Play with me more, more... [VAR(257, 2, 0)] and [VAR(259, 1, 0)], let’s play nicer... 
Gonna go with [VAR(259, 1, 0)] all over the place... Be nice to [VAR(257, 2, 0)]... Warm and cuddly... 
[VAR(257, 2, 0)] get strong, make [VAR(259, 1, 0)] happy. Round ones, square ones, triangle ones, wobbly ones... [VAR(257, 2, 0)] wants to see different kinds of Pokémon... 
[VAR(257, 2, 0)] and [VAR(259, 1, 0)] make a friendly combo. [VAR(259, 1, 0)]’s feelings, [VAR(257, 2, 0)] can understand. [VAR(257, 2, 0)]’s feelings, [VAR(259, 1, 0)] understands! 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] makes [VAR(257, 2, 0)] very proud! [VAR(256, 0, 0)] boasts to friends about [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! [VAR(259, 1, 0)] and [VAR(257, 2, 0)] are best of friends! 
Why does [VAR(259, 1, 0)] use only other Pokémon? Am I not needed much? Would I have been better off if I remained in the wild? No, I should give this Trainer a little more of a chance... 
Humans can’t understand the cries of Pokémon, nor our feelings. However, there are some among us that understand human speech... Hehehe, [VAR(259, 1, 0)], you’re not bad for a human. 
If a Pokémon were to travel alone, it would be limited as to where it could go. But traveling with a human, a Pokémon would be able to travel farther afield to more distant cities and lands. Traveling with [VAR(259, 1, 0)] has been rewarding and reassuring. And very entertaining... 
Some wild Pokémon frown upon others for traveling with humans. They jeer that the caught Pokémon have “forgotten the wild.” But that view is mistaken. They have just never met a Trainer who could be a great partner. A great partner like [VAR(259, 1, 0)], in other words... 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] is... A remarkable human and Trainer. That I can always perform the best any [VAR(256, 0, 0)] possibly can... I attribute that entirely to my partner [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. When we travel, I can see wild Pokémon eyeing us enviously... 
Does [VAR(259, 1, 0)] intend to ignore me forever? Give me more opportunities for me to shine... 
If a Pokémon is treated as a friend, it will return the sentiments. We grow fonder of humans that treat us with kindness... Does [VAR(259, 1, 0)] even like [VAR(257, 2, 0)]? 
Did [VAR(257, 2, 0)] get stronger? Who is responsible for making me so? Is it [VAR(259, 1, 0)]’s doing? Is the Trainer owed my thanks? 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] and [VAR(257, 2, 0)] are alike in some ways. In humanspeak, we match up well. Does [VAR(259, 1, 0)] think so, too? 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] is very impressive, especially for a human. The Trainer lets [VAR(257, 2, 0)] use every bit of power properly. It is a shame that [VAR(259, 1, 0)] is only a human... 
That [VAR(259, 1, 0)]... What is that Trainer thinking? Why make me join the team, then call upon me for nothing? Am I considered useless? Is the Trainer regretting having me? Does the Trainer dare disrespect this [VAR(256, 0, 0)] so easily? 
I have little understanding of [VAR(259, 1, 0)] as a human... [VAR(259, 1, 0)] may not be too bad, considering that I, an oft-shunned [VAR(256, 0, 0)], am one of the team... That said, I don’t intend to be all cheerful around [VAR(259, 1, 0)]... 
Our kind prefers to lurk in dark and dank places... But being with [VAR(259, 1, 0)], even bright and festive places seem less threatening... [VAR(259, 1, 0)] has a strange charisma... 
Not for a moment did I think I would be traveling with a human... If my [VAR(256, 0, 0)] friends were to see me now, they would be shocked. Or would they be envious of me...? 
That [VAR(259, 1, 0)] is the most impressive of humans. It takes a lot to make me, [VAR(257, 2, 0)], sunny and cheerful! As a show of affection, I should chomp down on the Trainer’s neck... Hahaha... Have no fear... I was merely joking... 
Wooooooh... [VAR(257, 2, 0)] has nothing to do... Keep me too bored, and I’m liable to sneak up and bite... 
Is there any human that would grow to like us [VAR(256, 0, 0)]? Well? Does [VAR(259, 1, 0)] like [VAR(257, 2, 0)]? [VAR(257, 2, 0)] doesn’t like... Well, no, maybe not... 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] treats me, [VAR(257, 2, 0)], nicely without being scared. But [VAR(257, 2, 0)] will be even scarier from now on. That’s what we [VAR(256, 0, 0)] do... 
[VAR(257, 2, 0)] is starting to forget a little about being in the wild... But [VAR(257, 2, 0)] isn’t feeling sad. It’s never boring with [VAR(259, 1, 0)]... 
There are no Pokémon that dislike humans... Only humans that dislike Pokémon... We [VAR(256, 0, 0)] are especially shunned... But [VAR(259, 1, 0)] always treats me as a friend and partner... 
Hnurrrr... Hunh? This is... Where? [VAR(259, 1, 0)]’s house, is this? It’s not? Hnurrr... If you don’t need me for anything, can I go back to my Ball? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm... I like to sleep most the time. Oh, I like to eat, too. That’s next. But what I really like is to think. I’m a very deep thinker. When I think about the future of the [VAR(256, 0, 0)] species... ...Hnurrr...hunh? Oh, I forget where the time goes. Hnurrrr... 
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm... There are lots of kinds of moves. I like those Dark-type moves, oh, and Dragon-type moves, too... How would they be for this [VAR(256, 0, 0)]? Will they be for me? Or a no, no, no sort of thing? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... I don’t know how to begin saying this... I liked living quietly before I met [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. Sssh. But I’m getting to like traveling with [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. I think I’m getting sort of funky. Do you think I’m sort of funky? No? No funk for me? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm... Other Pokémon, they say to me... “You’re not thinking, are you?” How insulting they should say so. It isn’t true what they say. Think, think, think, I do that. All the time, I think hard how to help [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. I concentrate! Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... I did not know that? I really don’t? What is this? I don’t know what to say? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... Well, I... I think I’m motivated. As motivated as the average. But it’s not so simple as that. Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... How should I say this? We both look out for each other. That’s what we try to do, I think. That is for the best. Hnurrrr... 
Hnurrr... How do I say? How should I describe us? We are the sound of both hands clapping. [VAR(259, 1, 0)] and I are together in synchronicity like twins. Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... What is left to say, I say? We have come so far now, where can we go but to see this through? Hall of Fame... Words so sweet fall from my mouth. Hnurrr... 
Sssshhnnn... ... ...Ssshhhnnn... ... Ssshhhnnn... ...

We’ve restored your Pokémon to full health. We hope to see you again!
This hotel is so romantic... I hope a knight on a Pokémon will sweep me away for a honeymoon here!

Trick Room is a doozy of a weird time-twister move. Use it, and for a while afterward, the slowest Pokémon move first! Before the faster can move, the slowest gets to attack! How you use the move is up to you, Trainer...

Destiny shall shift... Whether that bodes well or ill is beyond the spectrum of my sight...
Many are the eyes that I have gazed into over the years, be they human or Pokémon... But your eyes swirl with compassion, strength, joy, sorrow, and more... The ever-shifting colors in your eyes make you difficult to read...

I’ve always relied on the old Coin Toss to make any decision. It gives me courage because I’m not accountable for my decisions.
That Coin Toss is why we ended up in this musty, old, and stinky suite...
We wanted to be together alone so we could talk without being disturbed. We really need this time together, just the two of us.

Do unto others as they do unto you... Yup, it’s Payback! It’s good for Pokémon battles, but if you do that in real life... There’ll be no end to the fighting, that’s for sure. 
As I said, Payback is harsh. Use it after the foe, and its power gets doubled!
Jogging is good for you, but you have to make sure you’re not overdoing it!

Pokémon from around the country can be brought here. In other words, Pokémon from places like Kanto and Hoenn. This place also happens to be where you compete to see how quickly you can catch those Pokémon! 
It’s good to see you’ve come to join us for a visit. Let me make a gift of this Trainer Counter app for your Pokétch. 
Oak: I plan to be in Eterna City for some time. Being here, I should make the best of my time studying the Pokémon of the Sinnoh region. 
Pal Park is so scintillating! Trainers and Pokémon are so full of intensity here! 
I’ve never seen some Pokémon. Would you show me if you had one? 
                                    
                                                                   
                                                      
Let me see... A Pokémon that does nothing but eat and sleep.

We’ve all heard rumors about you! Word is, you’re a hotshot Trainer?! We’d be honored if you would participate in our Catching Shows.
Yes! You agreed to participate! It’s a happy day for me! Let’s not waste any time! Let me explain how Pal Park works. I wrote the Pal Park manual for situations just like this. What should I explain?
Pal Park is a place where you are timed on the catching of six Pokémon. You are provided with six special Poké Balls for the challenge. Participating Trainers are required to supply the six Pokémon that are to be caught. If you do not supply the stock of six Pokémon, you may not participate in the Catching Show. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
At the start of the Catching Show, you will be given six Park Balls. Use the Park Balls to catch the six Pokémon you provide. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
You may make Pokémon migrate from Kanto or Hoenn. Doing so will stock your Catching Game. Insert a Game Boy Advance Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen in the Game Pak slot. When your DS is turned on, currently caught Pokémon can migrate from the Game Pak to the DS Game Card. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
Pokémon caught in Sinnoh may also be used to stock your Catching Game. Please ask the guy next to me who’s in charge of stocking Pokémon. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
Would you like to take part in a Catching Show now?
Aww, that’s too bad. Well, just give me a shout if you’d like to participate.
Hi there, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Did you come to participate in a Catching Show?

Oh, hold on. You don’t have enough Pokémon for a Catching Show. You’ll need to stock us with six Pokémon to participate. You should make some Pokémon migrate from Kanto or Hoenn!
Very well, let me explain how things work around here. I’ll read to you from the Pal Park manual I wrote.
I’m sorry you had to retire. We hope you try harder next time. I’ll take what Park Balls you have left. Next time, please do stay to catch all six Pokémon.
Oh, your PC Boxes are filled. You have no room for six more Pokémon. You won’t be able to accept them, even if you do catch them. Make enough room in a PC Box and come back for your Catching Show.
Congratulations! That’s all six Pokémon caught! The audience sure enjoyed watching your Catching Show. All right, let’s see your all-important score from this show! ... ... Catching Points: [VAR(309, 0, 0)]! Time Points: [VAR(309, 1, 0)]! Type Points: [VAR(309, 2, 0)]! The total is... ... ... [VAR(309, 3, 0)] points! 
Wow! That’s an outstanding record! Kudos to you! 
Good! That’s a decent record. Props to you! 
Would you like to put all the Pokémon you’ve caught in PC Boxes?
Done! Your Pokémon have been boxed away. You’ll now have to save the game. 
Oh, then it might be fun for you to go for an even better score by trying to catch these six again. If you want to do another Catching Show, just come see us!
If you want to do another Catching Show, come see us again!

The only items you ever throw are Poké Balls! But is that true?! I want people to think about that. That’s why I give away the Technical Machine Fling. 
Using that move, the Pokémon hurls whatever item it’s holding at the foe. The move’s effect depends on what item is hurled. Remember, the move Fling fails if the Pokémon isn’t holding anything.
When I first started fishing, catching anything made me happy. But those days are long gone now... Now I get annoyed if I can’t beat my record by even an inch...

That Badge... It’s from Sunyshore’s Gym? You’ve been to that port town, then... Would... Would you lend an ear to this old man’s tale?
No... I shouldn’t burden you with this. My grandson grew up in that city by the sea. Worn down by trying to live up to his parents’ expectations, he found refuge in tinkering with machines. I wonder even now if I should have taken him in and raised him myself. Though I’m not certain if that would have been a good choice or not... I don’t think anyone could say. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said any of this to you...
Ah... Pay me no heed, then. I only hoped to unburden myself of some guilt...

Were you looking for me? Did you miss me? I wish I had a new nugget of wisdom to share with you, but alas, I don’t! So, I’ll have to make it up to you with this! 
Oh, why not? Take another! It makes up for the wisdom I lack! 
Those are my Nuggets! Try to spend them wisely! Nuggets of gold have to be worth more than nuggets of my wisdom!

Congratulations, Trainer! In recognition of your outstanding skill, our Frontier Brain is demanding a match with you. So, your next match is against the Arcade Star; no ifs or buts! Are you ready? 
Dahlia: No need to worry. ♫ Let chance do what it does. Like surprises from the game board, life goes through twists and turns. No need to worry. ♫ Things will go as they will. But, enough of that. I know one thing for certain. You have arrived here not merely because you were lucky. Let us not waste any time. I wish to test your skills myself! 
Dahlia: No need to worry. ♫ Let chance do what it does. Like surprises from the game board, life goes through twists and turns. No need to worry. ♫ Things will go as they will. But, enough of that. You are proving yourself incredible. Are you incredible because you are so lucky you shrug off bad luck entirely? Or, are you so incredibly talented to not be swayed by luck, good or bad? I wish to see for myself what brought you to me today! 
Dahlia: How fabulous of you! Your love of Pokémon shone through, and, in turn, your Pokémon believed in you. That is why you handled everything thrown your way splendidly. A most wonderful victory it was! 
Dahlia: Truly, it was so very fabulous of all of you! Bad luck, you cast aside, and good luck, you netted. That you did so is evidence of your abilities. By defeating me, Dahlia, you have proven your mastery brilliantly! I am sincerely happy for having this battle against you!

I’m the Day-Care Man. We look after the precious Pokémon of other Trainers. If you’d like us to raise your Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it’s you! We were raising your Pokémon, and my goodness, were we surprised! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! We don’t know how it got there, but your Pokémon had it. You do want it, don’t you?
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you. Your [VAR(256, 0, 0)]’s doing just fine.
Well then, I’ll hang on to it. Thanks!
You have no room for it right now... Come back when you’ve made room.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Egg from the Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
By the way, I saw your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] cavorting with [VAR(259, 1, 0)]’s [VAR(256, 2, 0)]. I may even have seen it receiving a piece of Mail.
If you want to pick up your Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you! Your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] and [VAR(256, 1, 0)] are doing just fine. 
I really will keep it. You do want this, yes?
The two seem to get along very well.
The two seem to get along.
The two don’t seem to like each other much.
The two prefer to play with other Pokémon more than with each other.
I’m the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. Would you like us to raise your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon should we raise for you? 
Fine, we’ll raise your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] for a while. Come back for it later. 
We can raise two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise another?
Ah, there you are! My husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then. Come again.
You don’t have enough money...
Do you want to take back the other one, too?
Very good. Come again.
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you. Now, about your Pokémon... 
By level, your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] has grown by about [VAR(307, 1, 0)]. 
Your Pokémon team is full. Make room, then come see me.
Which Pokémon will you take back?
If you want your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] back, it will cost $[VAR(309, 1, 0)].
Excellent! Here’s your Pokémon. 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] took [VAR(256, 0, 0)] back from the Day-Care Lady. 
Oh? But you only have one Pokémon with you. You can’t go off without a Pokémon. Come back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back?
If you leave me that Pokémon, what are you gonna battle with? Come back another time.
Huh? Now, now. If you leave that Pokémon with me, you’ll be left with just one. You will be better off if you catch some more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now. That is merely an Egg!
Fine, we’ll raise your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] for a while. Come back for it later.
Huh?

Will you battle against the Hall Matron?
Excuse me! Please hold on a moment. In recognition of your remarkable winning streak, our Frontier Brain is demanding a match with you. Actually, you have no choice. You must battle our Hall Matron! 
Argenta: My Battle Hall allows Trainers to mount challenges with their one favorite Pokémon. I imagine there were tense moments getting here with your chosen one. But understand that one shines the brightest when a challenge is overcome. I am Argenta, and I am your final and most daunting challenge. I dare you to overcome my challenge. 
Argenta: Well! My goodness, your Pokémon... It’s got star power beyond belief. Even from inside its Poké Ball, I can feel its charismatic brilliance. But I’m the Hall Matron. I’ll be the judge of that. I must battle it for myself and see if that brilliance is genuine. That is why we must battle now. 
Argenta: A good Trainer doesn’t force their favorite on anyone. A good one keeps with their favorite without drama or fanfare. That is how I see it, at least. And, by the way I see it, you’re an excellent Trainer! Be sure to visit the Battle Hall again with a favorite Pokémon. Until then, bye-bye! 
Argenta: You must never forget there is a place where everyone can shine. That goes for any and every kind of Pokémon, too. Spread that message in your own words. It’s one everyone should hear. And now, having lost, this lady has nothing left to say at all, but... Bye-bye!

Dawn: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? The professor told me something. It’s possible that either DIALGA or PALKIA will appear at the Spear Pillar!
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You’re friends with the elder of Celestic Town, aren’t you? She told me that she had something important to tell you.
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! May I see your Pokédex? ... Oh, my gosh! You’ve seen every kind of Pokémon in Sinnoh! Hey, let’s go show your Pokédex to Prof. Rowan!
Dawn: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], have you ever chatted with my kid sister?
Dawn: Oh, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], are you acquainted with Bebe? She lives in Hearthome City. Every Trainer should make it a point to pay Bebe a visit. She’s the administrator of the Pokémon Storage System. She’s awesome!
Dawn: Hey! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you’ve got a Poké Radar? I’ve got one, too! I’ll show you how to use it. Come with me to Rt. 202! 
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! How’s your Poké Radar? When you use it, do you sometimes see more than one patch of tall grass rustling? I’ve heard that patches farther away give you a better chance of seeing the same kind of Pokémon in a row.
Dawn: Sometimes a patch of grass sparkles when a Poké Radar is used. People say a different-colored Pokémon is hiding there! Could that be true?
Dawn: So, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I’m also helping the professor put together the National Pokédex. Catching Pokémon can be really challenging, can’t it? But, it’s also so much fun!
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], [VAR(259, 0, 0)], [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Congratulations for completing the National Pokédex!
Dawn: Is today maybe... Your birthday, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]?
Dawn: Giggle... Congratulations, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! And many more happy returns!
Dawn: Oh, it isn’t? I wonder what made me think that today was your birthday?
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I heard from the professor! Congratulations, Champ!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! The prof told me something cool. He thinks that either DIALGA or PALKIA will appear at the Spear Pillar!
Lucas: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You know the elder of Celestic Town, right? She told me she had something to tell you.
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Let me take a look at your Pokédex. ... Awesome! You’ve seen every kind of Pokémon in Sinnoh! You have to show this Pokédex to Prof. Rowan!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], have you ever seen my kid sister?
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], have you met Bebe? She lives out in Hearthome City. If you’re a Trainer, you owe it to yourself to visit her. After all, she’s the administrator of the Pokémon Storage System.
Lucas: Hey! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you’ve got yourself a Poké Radar, too? Cool! I’ll teach you how to use it! Come out to Rt. 202! 
Lucas: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! How’s your Poké Radar working out? When you use it, do you sometimes see more than one patch of tall grass rustling? Did you notice that patches farther away give you a better chance of seeing the same kind of Pokémon in a row?
Lucas: Sometimes a patch of grass sparkles when a Poké Radar is used. They say a different-colored Pokémon is hiding there! I wonder if that’s true?
Lucas: So, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I’m also helping the professor out with the National Pokédex. Catching Pokémon can be really challenging, can’t it? But I also have a ton of fun doing it!
Lucas: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Wow! I don’t know what to say! I mean, it’s so awesome and all... Sincerely, congratulations for completing the National Pokédex!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? Is it maybe your birthday today?
Lucas: I thought so! Congratulations, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You know, I’m glad we’re friends!
Lucas: Huh? It isn’t? Now, what made me think it was your birthday? Freaky weird.
Lucas: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! The professor told me the news! Congratulations, Champ!
Dawn: So, I was thinking... Those Pokémon you met, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]... Were they the ones said to be the creators of the Sinnoh region?

Hiya, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. [VAR(259, 1, 0)] was looking for you. I think he’s home now. Why don’t you go check it out?
Hiya, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. You’re looking for [VAR(259, 1, 0)]? He just went tearing off a little while ago. He’s probably not gone too far. Why not go chase after him?
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]? He went tearing off in a huge rush a while ago. ...Ouch. He ran right into me earlier. It’s still hurting. That kid’s growing up tough.
Everyone goes off on adventures, and then they gradually grow up...
It’s true that wild Pokémon do attack people sometimes... But, Pokémon also open their hearts to you, so you can become friends.
Oh! A Pokémon! You look good together!
Oh, you’re helping put together a Pokédex? That means you’re going to travel all over the place with Pokémon! That sounds like a lot of fun! I’m a little envious, to be honest!
Technology just blows me away! I mean, now you can play with people around the world...wirelessly!

Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! Did you just see the TV? Sure you did! Prof. Rowan’s that really important guy who studies Pokémon, right? That means he must have lots and lots of Pokémon. So, if we ask him, I bet he’d give us some Pokémon! 
Oh, hey! Is this a new PC?! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Uh... Where was I? 
Oh, right, right! We’re going to go see Prof. Rowan and get some Pokémon. I’ll be waiting outside. OK, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]? If you’re late, I’m fining you $10 million!

See? This is our Pokémon Research Lab. We’ll just go ahead and...

Rowan: I have something good here. You should take this as well. 
Rowan: That is a Technical Machine. That one contains the move Return. Using a Technical Machine, or TM for short, teaches a move instantly to a Pokémon. Bear in mind, however, that a TM is single-use only. The move Return gains power the more friendly your Pokémon is with you. It’s up to you, of course, if you want to use that TM or not. I’ll send you off with the wish that your journey will be fun. 
Dawn: Oh, wow. I didn’t know the professor had TMs. Was he a Trainer when he was young...? 
Lucas: Well, I’ll be... The professor had TMs...? Next thing, he’ll tell me he battled when he was young. 
OK, [VAR(259, 1, 0)], I’ll act as your mentor. I’ve got a bit more experience than you as a Trainer and as the professor’s assistant. OK, follow me!

Oh, that’s right! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]... Don’t you need to let your family know that you’re going to be helping Prof. Rowan with the Pokédex? You may need to go far away, so I think you should let someone know. Oh, but before you go, heal up your Pokémon at the Pokémon Center. It will be a lot less scary that way. OK, bye now! 
Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! I want to show you a few things. So, follow me! 
This building with the red roof is the Pokémon Center. You can get your Pokémon healed if it’s been hurt in battle. You’ll find a Pokémon Center in most towns.

Oh, yeah, right! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]... You should let your family know you’re helping Prof. Rowan put together his Pokédex. Sometimes, you have to go far away, so you should let someone know. Oh, but first, go heal up your Pokémon at the Pokémon Center. You’ll be safe then. OK, be seeing you! 
Oh, wow! Pokémon are so cool! You can make yours battle and make them stronger! I wish I had some! It’s so cool!
That thing you have! It’s a Pokédex, isn’t it?! You’re off to see all kinds of Pokémon now! Lucky you!
So I don’t forget what’s happened, till now, I’d better save this... There! Now I can take a break.

... Hmm... I see... This Pokémon seems to be rather happy. 
Well well! You’ve made your Pokémon evolve already?! 
Hm! Entrusting you with that [VAR(256, 0, 0)] was no mistake, it seems! 
Professor: Well, would you like to give it a nickname?
Professor: Hmm, OK, I see... And you’re happy with that nickname?
Professor: When I first saw you two  about to step into the tall grass without Pokémon, I was shocked. I was astounded by these foolhardy children. But now, you’ve astounded me in an entirely different way. Already, there is a bond growing between you and that Pokémon. I feel privileged to have met you. I’m sure [VAR(256, 0, 0)] feels the same way about you. That’s why I’ll ask you to cherish that [VAR(256, 0, 0)] of yours. 
Dawn: I’m so glad that you’re kind toward Pokémon! If you weren’t, I’d have to... Oh, I just can’t say it... 
Lucas: Boy, am I glad you’re kind toward Pokémon. If you weren’t, well... I don’t even want to think about it. 
Professor: Er-hem! Let’s move on to the main topic. There is something I want you to do for me. 
Allow me to properly introduce myself first. My name, as you know, is Rowan. I study Pokémon. First of all, I want to know exactly what kinds of Pokémon live in the Sinnoh region. To do so, it is necessary to collect data using the Pokédex. This is what I wish to ask of you. I want to entrust you with this Pokédex. Will you use it to record data on all the Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: ... ... ... ... I can stand here without speaking for hours. I’m a very patient man. Let me ask you again, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I want to entrust you with this Pokédex. Will you use it to record data on all the Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: Hm! Good answer! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] obtained the [VAR(65280, 1)]Pokédex[VAR(65280, 0)]!
Rowan: That Pokédex is a very high-tech device. It will automatically record data on every kind of Pokémon you encounter. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I ask that you go everywhere and meet every kind of Pokémon in this region! 
Dawn: I’ve got one, too! 
Lucas: I’ve got the same kind of Pokédex as you. 
Rowan: When you walked up Route 201 with your Pokémon, what did you feel? I’ve lived for 60 long years. Even now, I get a thrill when I’m with a Pokémon. Now, you should know that there are countless Pokémon in this world. That means there are just as many thrills waiting for you out there! Now go! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your grand adventure begins right now! 
Rowan: Go on! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your grand adventure awaits you!
Dawn: The Pokémon that I met for the first time was [VAR(256, 1, 0)]! If you would have chosen [VAR(256, 1, 0)] on Route 201, we’d have the same Pokémon now! Not that it matters, but... Anyway, I’m Dawn. I also help the professor add pages to the Pokédex. So, in a sense, I’m just like you. I just got a little head start on you, that’s all. I’ll be happy to teach you things. Glad to meet you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! 
Lucas: The professor asked me to help, so I’m filling the Pokédex pages, too. That makes us comrades working toward the same goal. I’ll teach you stuff later, OK? 
I’m [VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s father. I’ll be happy to assist you on your quest for the professor. Hahaha. Eh... I’m sure we can count on you!
Professor Rowan invented a new Pokédex while working alongside a professor from the Kanto region. Oh, my name is Roseanne. It’s an honor to be an assistant to our professor!

Hmm... So, you’ve seen [VAR(308, 0, 0)] Pokémon. 
What’s wrong? You’re not going to tell me you’ve seen too few to bother showing me?
Excellent work, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! The Pokémon of the Sinnoh region are being added to your Pokédex. This will certainly help with my studies of Pokémon evolution... 
Rowan: Hm! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I’ve been waiting to see you! You’ve met every kind of Pokémon there is in the Sinnoh region! This will help immensely with my studies on Pokémon evolution... 
Oak: Greetings, Professor Rowan! It’s been a very long time! I’ll tell you, Sinnoh certainly is a long trip from Kanto. Of course, if it means meeting new Pokémon, there’s no distance too great for the likes of us to travel. 
Rowan: Oh! If it isn’t my old colleague, Professor Oak! I should have expected as much from the world’s authority on Pokémon! We always used to joke, “Where there are Pokémon, you’ll find Oak!” It’s good to see that hasn’t changed one bit! 
Professor Oak, let me introduce you to my young assistant. This youngster has filled every page of the Sinnoh Pokédex for me. 
Oak: Ah, well, very glad to meet you! As you’ve heard, my name is Oak. I’ve been hearing a great deal about you from Professor Rowan lately. He’s been exuberant in praise about a fantastic young Trainer. I see that you live up to--no--that you’ve surpassed his praise. You’ve also got an impeccable sense of timing. You see, I had an errand to run for Professor Rowan on my visit here. He’d asked me to bring the data for the National Pokédex, you see. So, since you’re here, let me upgrade your Pokédex with the National Mode. After all, there are many kinds of Pokémon in this world of ours! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s Pokédex was upgraded with the National Mode! 
Oak: I’m afraid it won’t be easy to complete the National Pokédex. However, I’m sure you will make an honest attempt on our behalf! 
Rowan: Have no fear, [VAR(259, 0, 0)] will get the job done. By the way, Professor Oak, what compelled you to visit this region? 
Oak: Ah, yes. I’ve heard that the Pal Park is now open. If I remember correctly, it’s at the end of Route 221. The Pal Park has a special system that attracts every imaginable kind of Pokémon from every region. I’ve come to make certain that system is operating properly. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], you should make an effort to visit the Pal Park, too. Oops! I’ll be late for my meeting if I don’t get going! OK, it was a pleasure seeing the both of you! Bye, now! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], you should make an effort to visit the Pal Park, too. Oops! I’ll be late for my meeting if I don’t get going! OK, it was a pleasure seeing the both of you! Bye, now! 
Rowan: Off he goes, as busy as ever... 
Now, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]... I have a gift here as your reward for completing the Sinnoh Pokédex. 
Rowan: That’s the Pokémon Radar, or just Poké Radar for short. Use it, and it will indicate grass patches where Pokémon are lurking. I’d prepared that to help my field assistants put together the Sinnoh Pokédex, but you took care of that! I’m sure it will be useful for your goal of filling the National Pokédex.
Rowan: The world is immense. There are many more Pokémon. That means there are many more thrills for you to seek and enjoy!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] checked the PC. The screen is filled with special terms and academic writing that is impossible to figure out.
Research materials are carefully tucked away.
The refrigerator is filled with tasty sweets! Mmm...
It’s really quite something! Imagine... Cataloging every kind of Pokémon in the Sinnoh region! And in complete contrast, there’s [VAR(259, 0, 0)]... Anyway, you’ve been great for the prof’s Pokémon-evolution research!
Yes, that’s correct. Professor Rowan has been studying Pokédex systems with Professor Oak. Professor Oak is Professor Rowan’s junior in terms of seniority.
Rowan: [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! You’ve come back! You... You leave me speechless! You’ve done it! You really have done it! Never has my heart pounded this hard for so long in my 60 years of living! 
Dawn: The professor did a lot of checking up after you left. He was really worried about you, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]... He contacted acquaintances looking for help, and... [VAR(259, 1, 0)], I’m glad to see you safe! Welcome back! 
Lucas: After you left, the professor did a lot of checking around. He got really worried about you, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. He got in touch with people he knows to rustle up help... You didn’t need it, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. I’m glad to see you back safe, too. 
Rowan: Oh, yes, there was something I had to tell you. The three Pokémon of the lakes appear to have returned to their homes. So, tell me. How are things going for you? The Pokédex...? Hm! A total of [VAR(308, 1, 0)]! ...And the number of Badges? Well! You’ve got seven already! That only leaves Sunyshore’s Gym. Hm! You’ve come this far. Why not obtain Sunyshore’s Badge? And why not challenge the Pokémon League? That will broaden your horizons further than ever before. Not to mention the opportunities to meet even more Pokémon.
Rowan: Oh, yes, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. If you see Cynthia, please give her  my best regards.
                                                     
                                                           
                                                         
I... I’m stunned by your greatness! I feel as shaken and inspired as when my child was born! Oh, how wonderful it is to be alive!
Hearing what was happening from the professor gave me shivers. But he strongly stated that you will make everything all right. I believed that you would make it, and here you are!

Grunt 2: Hey now! Don’t complain. This is a pretty decent assignment. But Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon so creep me out... I don’t like being here either.
I wanted to get some flowers from the Floaroma Meadow... But some Team Galactic guys in snazzy outfits came along... 
Those Galactic guys went to the meadow past these flowers here...
Being surrounded by flowers puts me in an oddly pleasant mood.
I simply love it here... The atmosphere is so uplifting. You came to get emotionally healed too, didn’t you?
Welcome to Floaroma, the town of flowers, flowers, and more flowers! You should plant some flowers of your own, too. Yay for flowers!
The Berries you pick can be used as food for Pokémon. You can also trade them in at the florist’s. They’ll exchange Berries for Accessories to dress up your Pokémon.
I got drawn here by the sweet scent of Honey... Seriously, what’s that? What am I? A Pokémon or something? Mmm... Honey.
Oh, a SHAYMIN? If you have that Pokémon, then you also should have some Gracidea flowers. I’ve got a whole bunch, so you can have some. 
Gracidea flowers have been around a long time in this region. They’re given as bouquets to express feelings of gratitude. Isn’t that charming? With these Gracidea flowers you don’t need to say thanks with words. You can, instead, demonstrate your gratitude with a bouquet. How nice!

Floaroma Town was a barren, desolate hill long ago, avoided even by Pokémon. People started planting flowers on it because it was such a sad place. But nothing would grow... People didn’t know what to do... And then one day, someone expressed thanks for the blessings of nature. Then, the whole hill burst into bloom.
Do you think it’s cute how Pokémon pluck Berries?
Yes! You agreed! Here’s the TM for the move Pluck! 
Oh... I guess I just like weird things...
When a Pokémon uses Pluck, it eats a Berry held by its foe in battle. I like how it steals a Berry. It’s so cute!

The Sinnoh region’s newspaper is tiny, but it has many fans. That newspaper is printed right here!
“Weekly Poké Ball Roundup” is the featured top story. It’s a feature article on new types of Poké Balls. 
Which article would you like to read?
Dark caves and streets unlit at night are forbidding places to go. If you’re threatened by the dark, a supply of Dusk Balls is your biggest ally! Use them in the dark for the best Pokémon-catching performance! Keep the dark at bay on your travels with Dusk Balls!
Catching Pokémon is best accomplished by whittling the target’s HP down as low as possible, then tossing a Ball. But a Pokémon caught that way can’t be used in battle right away. That’s where the Heal Ball comes in handy. You can lower the target’s HP bar to red, put it to sleep, or paralyze it. The Heal Ball instantly heals whatever ails the Pokémon it catches! That’s the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball! Please, do give it a try!
When attempting to catch a Pokémon, you want to cut the target’s HP. But a fleet-footed Pokémon could bolt if you take too much time. The Quick Ball is the solution to that dilemma. It’s designed to work best when thrown right at the start of battle! The Quick Ball: the perfect gift for the impatient Trainer!
The Pokémon of the mothering sea aren’t like the others. If you are brave enough to face such intimidating Pokémon, the Dive Ball is perfect for you. For Pokémon you meet in the sea, and for Pokémon caught fishing... The Dive Ball is the Poké Ball you can count on!

This town is insignificant! There’s nothing of value here. It doesn’t need to exist, so I’ll blow it up with a Galactic Bomb! If you try to mess with me, I’ll shut you down with a Pokémon battle. So, what’s it going to be? Are you going to mess with me?
You dare to oppose Team Galactic? That means you’re taking on the world... No, the universe, even! 
That’s right! Very smart! You know what’s good for you! Team Galactic has come out to the boonies like this for everyone’s sake. Your cooperation is appreciated. Now, where is my partner...?
Too much to handle... I can’t do anything here... This place is nothing! I’ll be happily rid of this place! 
Oh, you were magnificent! Aren’t you quite the Trainer? As the elder of Celestic Town, I give you my thanks. Oh? That Old Charm... May I see that, dear? ... What’s that? You say Cynthia entrusted you with it to deliver to me? That Cynthia... She’s my granddaughter. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] handed over the [VAR(264, 1, 0)] to the elder.
This Old Charm is something made in Celestic Town long, long ago. It was made in honor of a mythical deity said to have created Sinnoh. These Old Charms are still discovered now and again. Since you’re in Celestic Town, why not look around inside the ruins?
You’ve gone to the trouble of visiting Celestic Town. Why not take a little more time to examine the ruins?
Cynthia: Was everything all right here? You saw those strange people with a Galactic Bomb, didn’t you? 
But those Team Galactic people...! I thought they were harmless. The bizarre ways they dress, and all their wild claims about making a new universe... I thought it was just silly talk. Nothing to take seriously. But they’re surprisingly more trouble than expected. Trying to monopolize Pokémon just isn’t acceptable! 
By the way, were the ruins fun to explore? If you’re interested, there is a library in Canalave City. It’s stocked with ancient books. You can look up Sinnoh history there. It might help you complete your Pokédex, too. The quickest way to Canalave City is to go west from Jubilife City.

Oh? Hm, hm... Your Pokémon is quite interesting!

It’s about trust between the Trainer and the Pokémon. Developing trust in each other is the key to victory.
It’s warming up to you in  a very nice way. It will grow even more friendly if you travel with it some more.
It’s not very used to you yet. You both need to develop trust for one another as Trainer and Pokémon.

Where are you from? ... Hm, Twinleaf Town, you say. Isn’t that close to Lake Verity? That lake is said to be home to MESPRIT, “The Being of Emotion.” That Pokémon may well be watching over you. Would you like to know more about MESPRIT?
MESPRIT is the legendary Pokémon that symbolizes the emotions. Beside it are also UXIE, “The Being of Knowledge,” and AZELF, “The Being of Willpower.” These three Pokémon are said to have strong and compassionate spirits. The power of their spirits maintains the natural balance of Sinnoh.
Hahaha! Well, of course you wouldn’t. It’s a tale from so long ago. It’s no wonder you weren’t interested.
Using the move Surf, you’ll be able to go to places that were inaccessible. You’d be surprised where you can go.
Celestic Town is the oldest town in all of Sinnoh. The town was founded to honor Pokémon from the distant past. Or at least that’s the legend...
Well, hello! You look good. I did some research of my own since that spot of trouble last time. Mt. Coronet’s acting up had me very concerned, too. Well, this is what I found in the shrine. It’s a book, and it’s quite old. Let me read a bit for you. “The bearer of the shining Adamant Orb summons DIALGA to the Spear Pillar. “The guardian Pokémon of time will answer the call. “The bearer of the shining Lustrous Orb summons PALKIA to the Spear Pillar. “The Pokémon that binds the spatial dimensions will answer the call.” It seems the people of long ago met both DIALGA and PALKIA, the Pokémon of time and space.
“PALKIA, the Pokémon that binds the spatial dimensions,” it is written... 
“DIALGA, the guardian Pokémon of time,” it is written... 
                                                               
My big sister is studying the myths of Sinnoh. She wants to know how people and Pokémon interacted in the days of myths. Were things different back then? Or were they the same as now? She says that’s the focus of her research.
It’s hard to tell for sure, but it’s probably an invaluable scroll.
It’s an old book. [VAR(259, 0, 0)] began reading it. “When that Pokémon was born, intelligence bloomed among us, enriching our lives. “When that Pokémon was born, emotions bloomed among us, giving us joy and sorrow. “When that Pokémon was born, willpower bloomed among us, spurring us into action...”

[VAR(259, 0, 0)] examined the ancient cave painting. Mysterious designs cover a whole section of the wall. There are three strange things forming a triangle. In the middle of them, a shining sphere? What is this all about? 
The cave painting’s meaning seems to be this... There existed beings... Beings so powerful, they were considered deities at the time. There were three Pokémon with power to match either being. The three kept balance with either being, as if they formed a pyramid. It’s an ancient legend of Sinnoh that is still told in Celestic Town. 
???: I would like to know more about that legend, if you will. 
Elder: Who might you be...? 
My name is Cyrus. I want to put an end to pointless strife and hostility. I am seeking the power to create the ideal world. Thus, I want you to answer. The world today can’t change because the three Pokémon keep it in balance. Is that what you are saying? 
Elder: I wouldn’t know. I do know the world is in balance. I’m quite satisfied with the world the way it is. I’m not interested in your question. 
Cyrus: ...Plead ignorance, will you? What a pointless attitude. You fail to appreciate that the world is incomplete. I will change the world. As the first step, I will destroy this cave painting that you’ve protected all these years. A new legend of a new world should take its place. Am I wrong? If you feel that way, challenge me. 
Cyrus: Well? Am I wrong? If you feel that way, challenge me. 
Cyrus: ...I know you, Trainer. We’ve met at Mt. Coronet. Why would you want to protect this incomplete world? As the boss of Team Galactic, I will show you the error of your ways. 
Cyrus: ...You chose to be a coward. How sensible of you. Stand aside and watch as I change the world.
Cyrus: ...You chose to be a coward. How sensible of you. Stand aside and watch as I change the world. 
Cyrus: ...Remarkable. But, Elder, your attitude told me what I needed to know. If the beings of time and space are brought together, they can’t be stopped... 
That cave painting isn’t protected simply because it’s old. We’ve preserved it because we value the memories that it represents. It is a legacy of people and Pokémon beyond measure. A man who fails to understand that... What world could he dream of?
Such a strange, strange man. Spouting such nonsense. The time and space of Sinnoh are filled with the memories and thoughts of countless people and Pokémon. This is a wonderful world. What need is there to change it? Oh, yes. I found something useful. You should take this. It belonged to my granddaughter, but she doesn’t use it anymore. 
If a Pokémon learns Surf, it can carry you across water and the sea. You’ve been a great help. That’s my thanks for it. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] examined the ancient cave painting. Mysterious designs cover a whole section of the wall. There are three strange things forming a triangle. In the middle of them, a shining sphere...
Cynthia: This cave painting... It’s always been described this way. The light in the center represents either DIALGA or PALKIA appearing at the Spear Pillar. The three lights around it were thought to be UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF. 
May I continue?
Cynthia: But, then, I realized that there may be another way of interpreting this. Could this triangle of lights actually represent a different trio? Could they be DIALGA, PALKIA, and GIRATINA instead? And the large light at their center. Does it represent something else? Could it be what created this world of ours? May I continue for a little bit longer?
Cynthia: Thank you for listening to my theory. Do you know of the ancient Plates they find all over Sinnoh? One of them had this engraved on it. “Two beings of time and space set free from the Original One.” I think this quote, too, points to the presence of another Pokémon. A Pokémon even more powerful than DIALGA or PALKIA. Does that sound plausible to you? 
I’m not quite sure how GIRATINA fits into this scheme of things, but... It’s said that in the Distortion World, neither time nor space were stable. I think that tells us something about GIRATINA, the only Pokémon there. It must have been as powerful as DIALGA and PALKIA, the rulers of time and space. In some way, though, GIRATINA has to have a power opposite of theirs. 
I’m sorry this is so long. May I say one last bit?
A long time ago, I wonder what sort of person painted this? DIALGA’s Roar of Time... PALKIA’s Spacial Rend... To the people back then, those Pokémon really must have appeared to rule over time and space. Seeing them must have shaken the people to their very core. This painting represents those feelings of awe, wonder, and everything else. It passed that memory to countless people, eventually becoming a myth... That’s what I believe as a researcher of myths. I think I let myself get carried away and talked for far too long. I’m sorry, and thank you. Let’s meet again. 
I’m so sorry. I let myself get carried away...

I’m a Cameraman, obviously. “The Eruption of Stark Mountain? The mystery of the fiery Pokémon asleep deep in the volcano!” I’ve had that documentary all mapped out in my head for a long time... But I have nothing on film as of yet. So much for that show. Oh, well. The world’s a huge place. There’re plenty of other mysteries!

A word of advice from a grizzled mountain man! Stark Mountain is a harsh, harsh place that’s rife with Fire-type Pokémon. Water-type Pokémon and moves should take the edge off. That’s my advice. You’d best heed it, no joke!
I was on a 54-win streak... If only I used that move when...

The building next door? I see Gym Leaders go in and out every so often.
The Battle Factory lets you make challenges without your own Pokémon. Maybe I should try...
In a Multi Battle, coordination with your partner is vital. By working together, one plus one could become not just two, but even three or four. But one times one is always one. Do you understand that?
Some say the universe was shaped by something born from an Egg... A man I met long ago told me that.

Oh? So, you are?! You’re Buck’s friend, yes! I’ve heard about you from both Buck and Wake. Well, my young friend, you’re always welcome here from now on! This is a private club for only Sinnoh’s Gym Leaders, or those vouched for by those selfsame Gym Leaders. It’s a place where the best seek to better themselves. Welcome to the Battleground!
What should we talk about today? ...Ah, I know. Let me tell you about the volcano named Stark Mountain. That volcano dates to when Sinnoh was made by the melding of time and space. Fiery lava spilled out and pooled, and then it became a Pokémon. It’s said the Magma Stone was used to keep the Pokémon pinned down. It kept the Pokémon from rampaging and the volcano from erupting.
Welcome to the Battleground! Make yourself at home like always.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                  
Buck: My place is open only to the toughest Trainers--I’m serious. You’re supposed to be introduced by a Gym Leader, but you’re special. Well, I’m off to the Battle Frontier. I feel like seeing how far I can go up the Tower. 
                                                                                                                               
              
              
              
              
              
Roark: I went down to the Underground every day. I toughened up my Pokémon by digging up Fossils nonstop. Could I show you how tough I made them in a battle?
Roark: Here goes! These are my rocking Pokémon, my pride and joy! 
Roark: This is another topic, but you know those Spheres you can dig up? Yes, those Spheres. The ones in the Underground. Why do you suppose Spheres grow if you leave them buried? It’s not a huge issue or anything, but doesn’t it strike you as odd?
Roark: Look, can I have some time? I feel lucky to have run into you here, so can I challenge you to a battle?
Roark: ...We lost control there. Next time, I’d like to challenge you to a Fossil-digging race underground.
Roark: Would you like to battle? You’ll get to see a different me than you saw at my Gym.
Roark: I’ve got a TYRANITAR I’m going to send out. It’s tougher than even my dad’s AGGRON! 
Roark: Hmm... That’s a heartbreaking answer.
Roark: Oh, you do want to battle?
Roark: Pokémon from ancient times... Fossils that are yet to be discovered... I wonder if I can find new Fossils if I dig all over Sinnoh?
Roark: When I became a Gym Leader, I finally realized how great my dad is. Not that I’d ever admit that to him, of course.
Gardenia: Hi, have you been keeping well? Let’s cut to the good stuff! Let’s get down to battle!
Gardenia: Yes, that’s right! A battle will tell you if someone you haven’t seen’s been keeping well! 
Gardenia: You won’t battle? You’re not in the mood, huh? Well, why not polish your Badges, then? That might put a shine on your day, too.
Gardenia: Oh? You do want a battle?
Gardenia: Out of the Gym, a Gym Leader is just another Trainer. But wherever I go, I still try to be as tough as I can. It’s not fair to my Pokémon if we were to lose because of me.
Gardenia: My Grass-type Pokémon are growing good and strong. I’m kind of interested in what Pokémon you have, too. Want to battle? A real quick one?
Gardenia: I can’t deny that Grass-type Pokémon have many weak points. But I’ll show you that’s not the only factor in deciding who wins! 
Gardenia: Aww, really? My grass Pokémon are growing good and strong, too...
Gardenia: My Grass-type Pokémon are growing good and strong. Come on, let’s battle! A real quick one, OK?
Gardenia: By the way... Have you been to the Old Chateau? Me? Uh, well, you know, I have my Gym Leader job and all, so... Well, actually, I’m here training... ...I’m here just for fun... Ahahaha! Don’t mind me!
Fantina: Finally, you have arrived! So, you shall challenge me. And I shall win. You will be startled by how much stronger I have become!
[VAR(65281, 200)]Ohohoho!![VAR(65281, 100)] 
Fantina: You... You disappoint me. It is very sad. But, realize, you have not beaten me if you refuse.
Fantina: This time, you shall challenge me, yes? But I shall win. You will be startled by how much stronger I have become!
Fantina: You are an amazing person! Très fantastique! I am delighted--for now I have a purpose! My purpose, it is to defeat you! It is a gift from you to me!
Fantina: Oh? It is you? Are you not taking part in Contests? Since you are involving yourself in Contests, you should challenge me.
Fantina: Pokémon battles, they are fun, always without fail. Why, you ask? Because, in those moments, we are at our most serious. 
Fantina: No? Well, that is OK, also. Just seeing your face, it has made me happy.
Fantina: Yes, what is it? I accept your challenge if you give it!
Fantina: I wish to battle as if I were dancing.
Maylene: I think it’s OK if I were to keep losing to the same Trainer. Battling that person tells me how much my Pokémon and I have changed. That’s why I would like to challenge you for a rematch now, [VAR(259, 0, 0)].
Maylene: OK! Rei! Oh, that’s my bow before a match. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I’m throwing everything I have at you! 
Maylene: Sigh... I braced myself for a battle. This is a little deflating...
Maylene: Yes, what is it, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? Would you maybe like a battle?
Maylene: I love visiting here. Buck’s grandpa cooks for us, and it’s all delicious. That’s not all! We can eat all we want. Isn’t that amazing, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]?
Maylene: Being together with Pokémon gave me the strength to keep going. Please, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], accept my challenge!
Maylene: OK, here we come, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! 
Maylene: OK! Got it! We’ll train much harder so we can battle with you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)].
Maylene: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I know I’m being a pest, but please, accept our challenge!
Maylene: Hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I’ve heard that it’s more healthy to go barefoot. Come to think of it, the Pokémon are all barefooted.
Wake: What’s there to do for Trainers here? Seems to me there’s nothing to do but battle!
Wake: My Pokémon have new Water-type moves under their belts! Let’s see how you bear up under them! 
Wake: Then, you get my song instead! Er-hem! The ring is my roiling sea. ♫ The towering waves shaped me. Crash! Crash! Crasher Wake! Crash! Crash! Crasher Wake! I’m the tidal wave of power to wash you away! Put out the fire, Crasher Wake! Run from electricity, Crasher Wake! Ah, ah, aaaah! The ring is my sea. ♫
Wake: Words aren’t needed. We understand each other through battle! That’s what makes us Trainers!
Wake: Battles that end with both sides enjoying the experience without caring about the winner or loser... That’s what I strive for. One of these days, I hope to battle everyone in the world... Isn’t that right, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]?!
Wake: All right! How’s it going? My Pokémon were toughened up by stormy white waters! They’ll take everything you can throw at them and then pull you under! Victory will be ours! Come on, let’s get it done!
Wake: That’s the spirit! Bring it on! 
Wake: Whoops! You’re giving me the slip? You’re a slick one, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]!
Wake: So, what’s the story? Are we gonna battle?
Wake: For all the training I do, there are still plenty tougher than me. The stronger I get, the farther away the goal seems to be. The road is harsh and long. There’s no end to it. But beside me always are my Pokémon. Every inch of the way!
Byron: I’ve faced many a challenger at my Gym. I trained on Iron Island while contemplating my worth for days... I have the confidence now to batter down your defenses. Could I ask you for a rematch?
Byron: We are tempered and honed by battling the strong. Here’s to our showdown! 
Byron: When you came to the Gym, you had a glint that’s dulled now.
Byron: I have the confidence now to batter down your defenses. Could I ask you for a rematch?
Byron: I trained by pummeling steel continuously on Iron Island alongside Pokémon... Gwahahahaha! I could still use more toughening up!
Byron: Since we last lost to you, we’ve been in training. I think we’ve addressed our shortcomings. Could I ask you for another rematch?
Byron: Thank you! Like me, my Pokémon were longing for another chance to battle with you! 
Byron: Gwahahaha! That’s disappointing, but all right! There’s a lot to be learned by battling you. We had our hopes up.
Byron: Could I ask you for another rematch?
Byron: Argh... Came up short again... Do I talk to my son Roark to train together...? No, that’s too embarrassing... Hmm... This is a dilemma...
Byron: ...That Roark thinks he can show up his old man? My act needs polishing still, I fear... Ah, it’s you! Don’t mind me. Make yourself at home.
Candice: Hiya! What’s up? I bet you can’t tell what I’m thinking! I’ll give the answer away. I want to battle with you!
Candice: This time, Candice is going to push through on willpower! 
Candice: Oh... Did my willpower intimidate you?
Candice: Listen, listen. You’ll battle Candice, won’t you?
Candice: Oh, wow, your scarf is totally in fashion. I wish I had one like that.
Candice: Candice is on fire! I’m blazing hot! Hot enough to melt Ice-type Pokémon! I need a battle to cool me down!
Candice: OK! I’ll show you how good Candice... I mean, how good my Pokémon can be! 
Candice: Awww!
Candice: You really want to battle with me, don’t you?
Candice: Awww! That’s it! I’m going to train so I can throw a Focus Punch myself!
Volkner: Your Pokémon... I can feel their power! Of course, you can sense the power of my Pokémon, can’t you? Let us battle with you!
Volkner: Yeah! It’s electric, this feeling of anticipation! Let’s do it! We’re going to make some sparks fly! 
Volkner: Aww, come on now. Don’t disappoint me...
Volkner: Hm? What’s up? You do want to battle?
Volkner: Winning makes me happy, and losing leaves me angry... That’s no great revelation, but it’s what makes me stronger.
Volkner: My ELECTIVIRE demands tough opponents. I’m willing to beg. Let’s battle!
Volkner: You! And me! Let’s make some sparks fly! 
Volkner: Well, yeah, an ELECTIVIRE is intimidating. I hear you...
Volkner: Hm? What’s up? You’re willing to face my ELECTIVIRE? And help toughen up my Pokémon?
Volkner: Some Trainers have Pokémon they just have to have in their party. For me, ELECTIVIRE is that Pokémon...
Cheryl: Oh, hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. You’re my opponent of the day?
Cheryl: My Pokémon have been itching for a battle. 
Cheryl: Oh, but my Pokémon were itching for a battle...
Cheryl: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], may I ask you for a battle?
Cheryl: Thank you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Thanks to you, my adorable Pokémon became a little tougher.
Cheryl: It’s been a long time... Hasn’t it? Would you care to have a battle with me?
Cheryl: I should warn you, my Pokémon can be quite rambunctious. 
Cheryl: Giggle... Pokémon would get worn out if we battled all the time, wouldn’t they?
Cheryl: ...Yes? Would you like to battle after all?
Cheryl: Being a Trainer isn’t easy. The more you battle, the more you discover. But, you know? I love Pokémon for that, too!
Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Please teach Mira about Pokémon!

Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], please? Please teach Mira about Pokémon!
Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], please teach Mira about Pokémon again! Mira wants to get a lot, lot stronger, like [VAR(259, 0, 0)]!
Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Mira is stronger now! Please! Battle with Mira!
Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)] will be shocked by Mira! 
Mira: Mira really did get stronger. Mira wanted [VAR(259, 0, 0)] to see.
Mira: You will battle Mira?
Mira: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you are always with your Pokémon. That’s how you got to be so strong. Mira is beginning to understand!
Riley: You and I, we’re both Trainers. Let’s forego the small talk and proceed right to battle. That’s my style!
Riley: Battling is our way of greeting! 
Riley: All right, then. So, what’ve you got to tell me?
Riley: See? It just doesn’t feel right if we don’t battle, does it?
Riley: Know your enemy. If you know your opponent’s Pokémon and what moves they use... If you have intelligence like that, your chances of winning are much improved.
Riley: Hi. Long time, no see. If it’s all right with you, I’d like to challenge you to a battle right now.
Riley: We’re pulling out all the stops to put your Pokémon down. 
Riley: Oh, all right. Then we’ll wait till you’re ready.
Riley: That look you have... I take it you’re ready for our battle?
Riley: If I weren’t on Iron Island then... If you hadn’t arrived on Iron Island then... Perhaps we would have never met. Or, would we have met elsewhere?
Marley: I... Is it OK to battle?
Marley: ...OK. I’ll do my best. 
Marley: ...Oh? ...You can be that mean?
Marley: ...So? Are we battling?
Marley: ...You’re so strong. It makes me feel happy. ...I don’t know why. This is a strange feeling...
Marley: ...Oh? A battle? With me?
Marley: ...OK. I...won’t lose...! 
Marley: ...Oh, you. I’m getting to dislike you a little.
Marley: ...If you won’t battle, I might not come back...
Marley: ...I might like battling with you. ...Just a little. Only a little tiny bit.
Buck: Ehehehe! You’re here at last! Let’s not waste time! Let’s do this!
Buck: ...I’m telling you right now. I’m seriously tough. Act surprised! 
Buck: Huh, what? That takes the wind out of my sails. Well, since you’re here, kick back, make yourself at home, and all that.
Buck: What? What?! So we are going to battle?
Buck: Fweh! Too much! I guess I’ll better my team at the Battle Tower.
Buck: One, there’s no shortcuts in the way of Pokémon! Two... Never mind that, let’s do this!
Buck: I can feel my Pokémon shivering inside their Poké Balls! It’s out of anticipation, not fear! 
Buck: Hey! This place! It’s named the Battleground for a reason!
Buck: So? Do you feel like battling now?
Buck: Fweh! Too much! I guess I’ll better my team on Stark Mountain!

There’s a move that doubles in power if the Pokémon using it is poisoned, paralyzed, or burned. I’ve got the Technical Machine for it right here. You want it?

I started living here where no one could reach me without using Rock Climb. I came because I got sick and tired of seeing people. But when I stopped seeing people, I began looking forward to visitors. Where one lives can change people and Pokémon, that’s what I’m saying.
Red Shards emphasize power. Blue Shards are for special effects. Yellow Shards are for status problems. Red Shards are what I like!

I’ve traveled a long way to make my beloved Pokémon even more beautiful. That will make it love me even more. Giggle!
Nothing is too good for my Pokémon. There’s no mountain too high to climb. That’s how I look at it.
Oh, how I long to become a member of the Ribbon Syndicate. My dearest Pokémon will be treated to dreamy experiences!
A member of the Ribbon Syndicate? You are? Really? How did you manage to collect so many Pokémon Ribbons?
You know how you can dig up cool stuff in the Underground? People are saying they’re digging up new, different stuff.
Nobody believes me, but something lurks in the Resort Area. It’s the hidden ruler of the area! You have to believe me! If you believe me, whip out your Super Rod and go fishing. Who knows, you may just catch the mind-blowing ruler!
Psst, hey, traveler! Yes, you! I want you to have this Villa! Oh, wait, no, no, no! It’s not what you’re thinking! This is no scam, see. In fact, you’ll be doing me a favor! See, I was given this Villa. But, to be honest, I don’t need it, either. So don’t say a word. Just nod and this Villa is yours!
Whew, that’s a load off my mind. The original owner was from Hoenn, see? The owner collected up all the rare stones of Sinnoh and went back home. I somehow got saddled with this place as if it were some gift. There’s no figuring what rich folks will think of next. Still, I thank you for helping me out. Come with me, will you? 
What, I still strike you as shady? I daresay I can’t blame you, though. An offer to get a Villa for free... That does throw up red flags, I agree. 
None too shabby, you have to agree. Step inside for a look-see. 
Rowan: Hm! I happened to be in the area on a small errand. I’d like to take a rest if you’d allow it.
Rowan: Hm! I appreciate your hospitality. 
Rowan: Hmm... Do you have something to hide?
Roark: Hi! Could I take a peek inside your Villa?
Roark: Thanks! 
Roark: ...Oh, sorry. Am I intruding on something?
Gardenia: Listen, listen! I came for a visit! Can I go in?
Gardenia: Yes! No time to waste! 
Gardenia: Oh, right. You must have plans already.
Maylene: ...Um, your Villa... Would it be OK if I took a look around?
Maylene: Oh, thank you. 
Maylene: Oh... It makes me a little sad...

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! You got yourself a Villa now? Woohoo, that’s wicked awesome! You must be rich! Gimme something! OK, this is what I’m gonna do. I’ll tell everybody you got a Villa! 
Dawn: Wow, [VAR(259, 1, 0)], this sofa is so sumptuous! You know, I think we have similar tastes, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]. 
Lucas: Is this sofa to your taste, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]? I can’t get comfortable sitting on something this expensive looking. 
Rowan: Hm, that’s rather a good Bookshelf. The curved surfaces describe sublime lines of an indefinable charm. Here, allow me to give you this book I’ve been reading as a gift. 
Gardenia: Oh, hey! A Houseplant! It’s really nice! Maybe I’ll get some for my Gym... The green coloring and the aroma... It’s very nice. 
Cynthia: Oh...? This is a good piano. I love the sound a piano makes. I savor every note with my entire being. It’s not only my ears; my spirit hears the music it makes... Ehehe, I made myself cringe saying that. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Too slooooow! You keep me waiting all the time! I’m fining you...$1 billion!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: So, anyway, how are things at the Battle Frontier? Me? You know I’m on top of it. I lose at the Tower sometimes, but...
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: Oh, yeah, the other day at the Battle Tower... Aww, never mind! I’m not telling you I battled my daddy!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: This is a cool place you have here. I’ve kind of got to like it, so I’ll drop in for no reason at all from now on!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: You know, I’ve been thinking lately... If we didn’t meet Prof. Rowan then, what would we be doing now?
Dawn: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], are you going to collect furniture now? Are you maybe the type who can’t bear to use Technical Machines? The sort of person who ends up making a collection of them?
Dawn: I had no idea that you can get a Villa as a gift. Who knows what can happen in life?
Dawn: I’m envious of you having your own place. I have to share a bedroom with my little sister!
Dawn: Sigh... To be with that special someone in a wonderful Villa like this... I think it’s a nice dream to have.
Dawn: You run into so many Pokémon in the Battle Zone. It’s a bit much. So, [VAR(259, 1, 0)], please let me catch a little rest.
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], are you collecting furniture, too, now? Are you one of those people who can’t stand to use Technical Machines? One of those types that end up with a TM collection out of hoarding?
Lucas: You could get a Villa as a gift? I did not know that. I wish someone’d give me a Villa. That way, I’d be able to assist the professor even more!
Lucas: The Battle Zone’s intense and fun, huh? So many different kinds of Pokémon, and Trainers of every variety... I’d like to go to even more places.
Lucas: Having this Villa must be convenient. It must be useful for checking up on the Pokémon in the Battle Zone.
Lucas: You can find so many different kinds of Pokémon in the Battle Zone. [VAR(259, 1, 0)], you don’t mind if I rest for a bit, do you?
Rowan: Hm! How are things going for you lately? Even if you manage to see every kind of Pokémon, that’s not the end. It would be impossible to know all about them based on sightings alone. There’s much to be learned from traveling with Pokémon.
Rowan: Hm! You seem well. Incidentally, did you know there are some Pokémon that evolve only at specific locations? For example, several Pokémon evolve by leveling up in Mt. Coronet. The variations of evolution... How many could there be?
Rowan: Hm! You seem well. Incidentally, did you know there are some Pokémon that require the use of specific items to evolve? MAGMAR and ELECTABUZZ are examples of such Pokémon. I never imagined that there would be new patterns of evolution. The variations of evolution... How many could there be?
Rowan: Hm! You look well. It’s commonly accepted that Pokémon evolve to grow more powerful. There must be other reasons than that. I would like to know during my lifetime.
Rowan: Hmm... This place feels like the home I shared with a friend long ago. It has the same sort of atmosphere.
Mom: Oh, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! I’d heard from [VAR(259, 0, 0)], but... This is quite grand for a Villa. This makes me happy, dear! I’ll have a fun place to visit!
Mom: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], this Villa, if I were to give it a grade... It would earn a perfect score! It makes me happy just being here.
Mom: If it were me, I would put that piece of furniture over there... Oops, sorry. This is your place, [VAR(259, 1, 0)].
Mom: It must make you happy collecting the furniture. But I’m wondering: do you collect Accessories? Even if you don’t enter Contests, it’s fun to dress up Pokémon.
Mom: I think Contests and home designs say a lot about the person. If the person’s character shines through, I think people respond to it.
Roark: The Underground extends even underneath the Resort Area. I wonder... If I really tried, would I be able to extend it to even places like Kanto and Johto?
Roark: If it were me, I would display the things I dig up. You know, from places like the mine and the Underground. I would turn the place into my personal museum.
Roark: If it were me, I’d like to put a Fossil over there. You don’t think so? No? I think a Fossil would match this decor.
Roark: This place feels different from an underground Secret Base. That reminds me: what color is your underground Flag now?
Roark: What I think about while digging underground... What did the Pokémon see before they became Fossils? I’d love to go back and see them as they were back then.
Gardenia: Sigh... This is so dreamy... The Resort Area’s a nice place. Of course, Eterna is a good place, too. We have the huge forest, first of all.
Gardenia: I know it’s a little abrupt, but don’t you think Grass-type Pokémon smell nice? It makes me happy just being around them.
Gardenia: I could tell you ten good things about Grass-type Pokémon. Which kind of Pokémon can you say good things about? Ooh, maybe ten won’t be enough.
Gardenia: Do you remember those rumors about the Old Chateau? They say there really were ghost Pokémon there in the old days. ...That’s so scary. What if they suddenly came back?
Gardenia: ...I’m in a dilemma now. You see, I don’t like ghost Pokémon very much. But, what if... What if there was a Grass-type ghost Pokémon? What then?
Fantina: Oh, c’est fantastique! This is where you practice dancing, non?
Fantina: Whenever and wherever, dance, dance, dance! If you dance all the time, the dancing at the Contests, they become challenges no longer.
Fantina: Ooh la la! This is very nice! It is often that I come to the Resort Area also. It is because the Ribbon Syndicate, it is here. Therefore, I will visit your Villa often also!
Fantina: Ooh la la! I have an inspiration! The combination of moves for a Contest, it has come to me in a flash! Very well! We shall meet at the Contest Hall, yes?
Fantina: You! Have you met Dahlia? She of the Battle Arcade? That woman! The way she dances! Especially the way she wiggles! Ooh la la! I love her style!
Maylene: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], please hear how my training is going. Thanks to my training, it doesn’t feel so cold to be in deep snow! Well, just a little...
Maylene: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], please hear how my training is going. Thanks to my training, my handwriting has improved tenfold! ...Yes. It has absolutely nothing to do with how strong I am as a Gym Leader.
Maylene: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], please hear how my training is going. Thanks to my training, I can tell how strong my opponent is beforehand. Oh, yes, [VAR(259, 1, 0)], you’re ridiculously tough.
Maylene: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], please hear how my training is going. Thanks to my training, I’m beginning to understand the feelings of Pokémon. It lets me choose moves with much more confidence!
Maylene: [VAR(259, 1, 0)], please hear how my training is going. Lately, my father has been overseeing my training! Well, only when he wins at the Game Corner, but... I’m still delighted he does this with me!
Wake: Hey! [VAR(259, 0, 0)] told me to come. This is some spread you’ve got here! It’s spectacular, yeah! How would I put it now...? It’s, uh, spectacular! It is what it is!
Wake: Mmmmm...! Listen, you! How would you like to decorate these premises with my trophies? No, scrap that thought! How about a wrestling ring?
Wake: I’ve been thinking, though. That pal of yours, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], and Palmer are father and son all right. I mean, just seeing them, they’re hilariously alike. Their overall atmosphere and their mannerisms and such... Seeing them cracks me up.
Wake: ...This place here... You don’t have a microphone handy? How am I supposed to perform my signature song, I’d like to know? Ah, ah, ah. The ring is my roiling sea. ♫
Wake: I was meaning to ask you, by the way... You’re tuning in to my wrestling matches on TV, aren’t you? In wrestling, you always have to be aware of what the other guy’s doing. That’s the same as Pokémon battling, wouldn’t you say? So, what I’m saying is, watch me wrestle if you want to get better at battling!
Byron: Gwahahahaha! I spent a long time living on Iron Island. A place this fancy, I feel a little out of place. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place. It’s nothing like my son’s!
Byron: Well... I have to admit I’m not very interested in furniture and the like. My interests run more to things like digging tools, obviously. The shapes of Pokémon fangs and claws are interesting, too.
Byron: Digging underneath Iron Island was a good time in my life. Working alongside Pokémon constantly for iron ore... But that’s all in the past. The young people today should find their own paths to happiness.
Byron: Roark is still a boy, but at the same time, he’s a man in his own right. That’s why our opinions clash at times, and why we break out in battle. Gwahahaha! You weren’t supposed to hear that! Forget I said it!
Byron: You’re acquainted with a fellow named Riley, aren’t you? He’s a mystifying sort, that one. I have no idea how old he is, to tell you the truth.
Candice: Giving you an Icicle Badge made me think. It made me realize this one thing. I don’t have to act cool out of character. I just have to be me!
Candice: In a battle, when both sides are down to their last Pokémon... What do you think about then? I put all my trust in that Pokémon and cheer it on. That’s all you can do!
Candice: Whew... The Resort Area is pretty warm. Maybe Candice is overdressed?
Candice: This furniture... Oh, I get it... It’s like this... Oh, please don’t mind me.
Candice: Why does the Snowpoint Gym Leader have to guard that icy temple anyway?
Volkner: I was told by Flint that we’re meeting here. ...That’s funny. You haven’t heard anything about it?
Volkner: Every one of my Pokémon are top class in potential. They’re all potential game breakers!
Volkner: Oh, yeah. I decided not to join the Elite Four. I got an earful about not renovating the Pokémon League building. Well, no. I’d rather be a Gym Leader where I could meet ordinary folks.
Volkner: My ELECTIVIRE is a force of nature to be reckoned with. No, don’t get me started. I’ll tell you another time.
Volkner: Hmm... This place gives me ideas about how I can renovate my Gym.
Cynthia: I think I could get to like this atmosphere. It gives me an idea about the kind of person that lives here. Yes... An honest person who loves Pokémon...
Cynthia: It’s so relaxing here... Sigh... I don’t want to go home. It’s a complete mess with all my research papers strewn about. My house? Even the region is a secret!
Cynthia: What’s necessary to become stronger? I think it’s important to never lose your love of Pokémon. That’s all I can say because that’s how it was for me...
Cynthia: The Spear Pillar... The Distortion World... Did the people in the distant past see the same things as us? Could that be what led them to leave the cave painting of Celestic Town?
Cynthia: When you are facing a Trainer in a battle, you can learn everything about them. What Pokémon they have. What moves they’ve taught. What items they make Pokémon hold. There’s no need for words then. That’s why I’d like you to come see me again at the Pokémon League.
Flint: Hey, you! You used my prize money to buy this furniture, didn’t you? So, I’ve got a right to lounge here, am I right?
Volkner: My relationship to Flint? There’s no love lost, that’s for sure.
Flint: Hey, listen, you! If that Volkner tries to sell you on Electric-type Pokémon, ignore him! You have to go with Fire-type Pokémon. It’s the way of the future!
Volkner: When I got my first Gym Badge, I used the move Thunderbolt. Ever since, I’ve stuck with the Electric type even as I got better. I do it because I don’t want to ever forget how happy I was when I won. Incidentally, Flint’s fascination with the Fire type is only from his name. Someone told him that a flint is what’s used to spark a fire, and that was it.
Flint: ...Volkner. Volkner: What? Flint: Let’s say I’m in a battle, OK? What if I didn’t use my Poké Balls? Instead, I can have my guys come in and out of my Afro to battle. That’d bewilder the other guy, huh? Wouldn’t that be hilarious? Volkner: ...Maybe. Don’t ruin things for others, though.
Flint: Hmm... Volkner: What’s wrong? You’re looking serious for a change. Flint: It’s this place. You know how drab the League is? Don’t you think the place should be more, you know, festive? With more decorations, awards, and things like that? Volkner: Don’t start! That will make my Gym stand out less.
Flint: Say, hey, Volkner. What do you say we battle here? Volkner: ...Are you kidding? That’s why you Elite Four are called irresponsible. Flint: What, we are? Volkner: Well, at least you are. I tell everyone you’re irresponsible.
Maylene: What makes a Gym Leader a good one? Candice: Gee, I wouldn’t know. That’s a tough question. ...Maybe we should ask Gardenia sometime.
Maylene: ...You know those Accessories for Pokémon? Would it be funny if someone were to wear those? Candice: What is it, Maylene? Did you want some Accessories? I’ll give you some of my favorites. Maylene: ...! Th-thank you so much!
Maylene: ...Candice? Candice: Yes? Maylene: Oh, sorry, it’s nothing! I didn’t say anything! Candice: Giggle... I like lounging here. 
Maylene: Candice, what does it mean to be strong? Candice: I can’t answer that! Let’s go look for that answer together. We’ve got Pokémon and [VAR(259, 1, 0)] on our side, after all. Maylene: Yes, please!
Maylene: ...This is delicious! Candice: Then have some more. Maylene: Yes, please. Candice: There’s plenty to drink. You’re a growing girl!

All I need to be happy is my TV. That’s all I need. I learn so much just sitting here. I absorb knowledge! I learned about the Pokétch app Marking Map, for instance. They say the Marking Map can track Pokémon that travel around. ...I’ve never met any traveling Pokémon, but I’ve heard about them.
There’s big trouble! They’re saying the volcano’ll erupt! I might even have to leave here!
The best Trainers from all over congregate at the Battle Frontier. It’s not limited to Sinnoh, no. It must be a happy achievement to be able to win there with your favorite Pokémon you’ve caught yourself.
You’ve seen every Pokémon in Sinnoh! That is so cool! I’m going to travel with Pokémon when I get bigger!

Here I come!
Yeah! 
Bleah! 
Hey, rookie! Bring it on!
Yeah, I knew it. You’re a rookie after all. 
Bleah! You’re just a rookie! 
I gotta say it, shorts are the best! They remain comfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest! 
I’ll never stop wearing shorts. Not for anybody! 
I make it a policy to wear miniskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate! 
What’s your policy? 
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing! 
Miniskirts make legs look longer! Is that a good thing? 
I’m on the lookout for adorable accessories.
Let me know if you find any nice accessories! 
I wish I could dress up! 
I want to test out something I learned at private school.
Yes! It worked perfectly! 
Hmm... Something’s wrong here. 
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and willpower. 
OK, so willpower doesn’t cut it on its own. 
I study every day because I want to work all over the world.
My dream is worldwide! 
I need to study up on Pokémon battles. 
When I grow up, I’m going to be a Pokémon professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem! You’ve much to learn, youngster! 
Er-hem! Er-hem! Seems I’ve much to learn still! 
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply don’t lose!
It’s a victory of knowledge! 
I’m going to review the subject! And I’ll subject you to my revenge! 
Oh, now you look wimpy. I might win this.
I so did it! 
Ouch, that hurt. 
It’s fine, fine. No need to say a word.
It’s fine, fine. You tried your best, I know. 
It’s fine, fine... No need to say a word... 
I’m rich!
Well, of course. I’m rich. 
What happened? I’m rich, aren’t I? 
Hmm. So, you’re good, huh?
Hmm. You’re no big deal. Hmm? 
Hmm. So, you are good. Hmm. 
Oh, yes. I shall attack now.
I’ve done it! 
Oh, how disappointing. 
Over it is, your adventure. Come hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was. 
Oh, how vexing this so is. Verily, I thank you. 
How boring...
So truly boring... 
That was a good way to waste some time. 
Hunh? Where is everyone?
Hey, guys! Where are you?! 
I came to camp, but I think I got separated from my friends... 
Oh! You have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my Pokétch, but I still won! 
I was fooling around with my Pokétch, and I lost... 
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It’s the power of the forests. 
I’m going back to the forest. 
I’ll battle you like I’m on a picnic!
Lalala! 
Pretending this is a picnic won’t let me win. 
Ooh-la-la! Here we come!
Ooh-la-la! So happy I won! 
Ooh-la-la! Even losing can’t dampen my spirits! 
I’ll teach you what’s fun about battling.
Battling me was fun, wasn’t it? 
Oh, my, that was inspiring! You’re the greatest! 
I... I can swim, really! I don’t need my inflatable tube!
It... It’s true! 
I... I’m not lying! 
I like rivers more than the sea. Which do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels just super. 
I don’t like the sea because the salty water burns my eyes! 
Go, go, go! Go, my Pokémon!
That’s the way! Way to go, my Pokémon! 
Good effort! Way to go, my Pokémon! 
The beach sand is so hot! It makes me go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea! 
Ouch, ouch, ouch! 
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash! Ker-splash! 
Flip, flop! 
I’m a girl in love with her inflatable tube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I’m a girl in love with her inflatable tube! 
Good-bye! I’m a girl in love with her inflatable tube! 
Oh, yeah! I’m feeling it! I’m tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah! 
Tch! Losing threw off my rhythm! 
Rock? Jazz? Techno? Anything’ll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal! 
So, yeah... You’ve got me in the mood for singing the blues... 
Let’s get this session on!
You’re obviously short on practice. 
My dream of a world tour... It seems so far away... 
Oh, hello... Well, isn’t that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf? 
Oh, you! You’re not just fashionable, you’re good with Pokémon! How unfair! 
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh? You’re not my fan? 
What a horrible way to treat an Idol... 
La, lala, lah.
La lalala. Lalalah lah. 
Bye-bye, lalah! 
Let’s see who loves Pokémon more, you or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for Pokémon trumped yours! 
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is stronger than mine? 
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind of tough.
You don’t want to underestimate me. 
You’re some kind of mighty. 
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon. Don’t be shy now, come on.
I see... Cute, but on the weak side. 
I see! Cute, and yet tough. 
My Pokémon are cute, but they’re not very tough!
Oh? We won? Seriously? 
It’s OK. I like my Pokémon. That’s all that matters. 
I’ve been pampering my gang too much lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it! I knew I could count on my gang! 
Pampering Pokémon too much is no good... 
Won’t you join our Pokémon Fan Club?
There’s all sorts of fun things to do if you join! 
Join us! Become a Pokéfan like me! 
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice. One loss served fresh. 
Ah, an excellent choice. A win served fresh. 
What I really hoped to become was a cook.
I don’t mind this job now, mind you. 
I just find it hard talking to strangers. 
For battles and order taking, speed is essential!
Like, chop-chop! You got served. 
Food is like battling. Serve it while it’s hot! 
My job is about serving others. But don’t expect me to serve here.
Mufufu. 
Why couldn’t you serve me? You won’t make friends that way! 
Isn’t this cute? My uniform.
It’s my favorite! 
You messed up my uniform! 
You’re good, aren’t you?
Oops. I’m a little disappointed. 
I knew you were a tough Trainer. 
I catch and raise all sorts of Pokémon.
See? I’ve raised them pretty good. 
I need to raise my Pokémon some more! 
I’ll snag you with my net!
It’s in the bag! 
Hey! Don’t run away! 
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS. Like, king size! 
If only I had a giant HERACROSS... 
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine! 
I lie shattered... 
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah! You saw it! 
You didn’t fall for my fake ninja boasting! 
I shall become a real ninja when I grow up!
Excellent! Excellent! 
So, what’s a real ninja supposed to do? 
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay! 
No! No tormenting me! 
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn’t it cute? 
My mommy is really good at sewing. 
Let’s do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone! 
Waaaaah! 
Sure, we’re going to battle, but don’t be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax. It’s best to be natural, dig? 
You have to loosen up some more. 
Fish, fish, fish, that’s what I do! I’m gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah! I am at the top of my game! 
Oh, waah! I let that get away! 
Exploring relics isn’t all fun and games!
Your skill level says you probably won’t make a good Ruin Maniac. 
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins! 
These mates of mine traveled the world with me!
What do you say? Pretty tough, right? 
Maybe it’s time we hit the road again... 
Hey, there! Check this out! My rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either. My Pokémon are tough, too! 
Aiyah! Hey! Wait! No! Stop! Don’t touch! 
Now just be patient. I’ll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren’t they awesome? They’re the most super of the uber! 
Awawawah... My... My Pokémon... 
Look! This is my favorite parasol! Oh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren’t they both cute? 
I’m only showing you! You can’t have any! 
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond a rainbow? 
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good things are in store. 
If you were the weather, what would you be now?
Right now, I’m feeling sunny without a cloud in the sky! 
I’m feeling fogbound... 
I really don’t like weak Trainers!
You don’t inspire much trust... 
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough and bursting with life! 
Lately, I’ve had a lot to worry about...
Winning makes all my worries seem trivial! 
You just added to my worries... 
This may hurt a little bit, but we’ll be done quick. Hold still!
There! Done! 
Ooh, no! That hurts! 
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle... I think I have a cold... 
Sniff... Sniffle... My nose is clogging up... 
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be? 
Do you have some cologne on? You smell sort of nice! 
You’re going to lose, but you’ll get to enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That’s what you get for swooning to my aroma! 
Kiiiih! I am so angry! 
Let my guitar howl! Hear me scream!
Yeahey! 
Giyaaaah! 
You should channel your feelings into songs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now? It’s rock! 
The way I feel now is kind of folksy. 
Now hear me! The Bird Keeper’s credo number one!
Soar high on a win! 
Rest your wings on a loss! 
Let’s both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could! 
Good going! 
Fly, fly, fly! We’re going to rule this battle!
Zoom! 
We’re gonna crash! 
I’m the Sailor among Sailors! I was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep! The sea was my mother! 
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on land, I get no-motion sickness... 
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them... I hear the sound of waves... 
I want to become a big man. Big like the sea big. 
Yahoo!
Come on! You holler too! 
Gweff! Hack! Hack! Hollering choked me up! 
You should aspire to the Hiker’s way of life!
You see? You love my lifestyle, don’t you? 
Now, come on now! You should look up to the way I live! 
My Pokémon and I are Idols!
Say what you will! We’re Idols! 
We have you beat when it comes down to popularity... 
Watch me! All eyes on me!
Ooh... This is what I live for... 
I became an Idol because I wanted everyone to see me! 
I’m too into battling... They might fire me as an Idol...
Battling is too much fun! 
I can’t help myself. No one can keep me from battling. 
I run a marathon every morning! It’s great!
My buff physique makes for easy wins! 
So I lost! I can still run great marathons! 
I’ll run on the spot while battling for the good of my health.
Let’s hear it for good health! 
Gasp! My ankle! I rolled my ankle! 
Out of the way! I’ve got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you somewhere, too? 
All the delivering I do every day... I’ve got deep muscle pain! 
It was me who put up the buildings around these parts.
So, what do you think? Cool stuff, huh? 
My dream is to make a building taller than a mountain! 
Smell that? That’s the smell of hay clinging to my body.
Whoa! 
This smell I have is the sweet scent of hay that Pokémon surely love. 
All right, take a run at me! My barrel chest can take it!
What? That’s all you’ve got? You can take a harder run at me! 
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It’s like you broke my barrel chest... 
I’m not getting any younger. I can’t overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for in experience. 
Oh, you’re good and young. There’s a sparkle about you. 
Hey! You there, Trainer! You and me, we’re battling!
Owned! 
Unbelievable! 
These here are my Pokémon. I raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren’t they? 
Well, I’ll be! We lost that one! 
I’m going to do my level best. You’d better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best! 
Yup! We tried hard, y’all! 
OK, everyone! Big smiles!
Big smiles! Come on! 
That’s a great smile! Your victory pose is picture perfect, too! 
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus! 
Zoom out, fade... 
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff... My camera’s toughened me up. 
Oof... I’m feeling groggy... 
Hello there, Trainer! Please battle with me!
Thanks for your help! 
I appreciate the lesson! 
I’ll do anything for a good news story!
I’m relentless about battling, too! 
Stop! Please, stop! You’ll break my mic! 
So, the question is, what is your opinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that what you’re thinking? 
I’m doing a live report on the topic of myself! 
Come on! We’ll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal! 
Wait! Don’t leave me behind! 
Gear change! We’re attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom! 
Kaboom! 
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at a full run?
Too slow! 
I’m taking it to a zone beyond speed! 
I’d rather cycle casually than go full speed.
Let’s take it easy. 
You ought to take things more casually... 
I only know how to go at full power, even against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win! 
Please! Let me call you Master Trainer from now on! 
My spirit burns, my fists are steel, and my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph! 
I sweated more. That makes me the victor! 
En garde!
I’m still ready for more. 
Urgh... Don’t you forget this! 
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight! 
You’re not bad, you. 
The ultimate of my technique! Experience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest! Gwahahaha! 
I’ve fallen in defeat? Gw-gwaaah! 
Hi! Little kid! A battle, please!
Little kid! Thank you very kindly! 
Little kid! I’m really upset over this! 
I, um... I’ve never actually learned how to do karate.
You’re kidding?! I’m naturally talented?! 
A Black Belt is cool, huh? So I just dress up like one. 
It’s been five years since I took to the mountains. My hair’s grown wild!
I bathe every day! How dare you? 
Another five years...? 
Did I catch you smirking at my eight-pack abs?
You don’t appreciate the beauty of pure muscles! 
Musculature is the ultimate beauty! 
In love and in battles, I’ve never tasted defeat!
See? We won again! 
So, I lost. I don’t care! I have a date soon, so I don’t care! 
This is it! Over the top! Everyone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen! Victory is ours! 
Retreat! Sound the retreat! 
My career as a Trainer dates back 75 years. You think you can win?
Here’s a toast to my history! 
My history of glory... 
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was. 
I tip my hat to you. 
Oh, my... Such an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed? How adorable... 
I see... You’re more than simply adorable. 
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn’t you say? I find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp... Oh, dear... I’m worn out. 
Being rich doesn’t shield me from having worries...
Of course, being well off is much preferable to poverty, but... 
Lavish parties day after day... It gets rather tiresome, I must say. 
Come to know defeat... Learn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more powerful... 
The defeated merely slink away... 
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell! 
My power of suggestion failed to charm you! 
...
...Did it. 
I focused my mind in silence... 
My powers! There’s no trickery about them!
This is psychic power! 
There really is no trickery... 
Take it all!
Ahaha! 
Gah! 
Close your eyes and count... Slow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my victory! 
Tch... I thought I could lull you to sleep. 
I live among Pokémon.
I’ve never been much of a battler, but... 
I’m just not much of a battler. 
...They’re Pokémon I’ve raised with my father...
...Dad, are you seeing this? I did it... 
Dad, I can’t... I need to raise them some more... 
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of honest effort!
Yahaha! I’ve had a hands-on time raising those Pokémon! 
Urgwah! Look what you’ve done to my Pokémon! 
Will you have a look at the Pokémon I’ve raised?
Well? Cute, aren’t they? 
Cut a girl some slack! 
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right? 
Oh, but they’re so cute! 
Nice to meet you! Underestimate me at your peril!
Told you! 
I guess I underestimated you... 
Hmhm... I must say I like the look in your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat. Like jewels they are! 
Your eyes shine brighter than any big gemstone I keep at home! 
When I was your age, I was quite the daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild youth. 
I daresay, you’re quite the daredevil yourself! 
If you want to run home to mommy, here’s you chance, punk!
Geheheh! 
Waah! I want my mommy! 
Battles achieve nothing! Take my hand! It’s about love!
I didn’t mean to battle--but take my hand! It’s about love! 
Battling is futile! Take my hand! It’s about love! 
I dropped my glasses. I can’t see straight.
I guess I won. I can’t see enough to tell. 
I guess I lost. I can’t see enough to tell. 
Steadily and surely. You build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won! 
But I did things steadily and surely... 
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha! 
Sob, sob, sob... 
Everybody gather around for my stupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn’t that amusing? 
Nrrgh... I am not amused. 
I shall train with you.
Show some spine! On your feet! 
Fine! That will do! 
Why get all intellectual about things? If it’s fun, why question it?
See, I can still win. I don’t see a problem! 
So I lost! If it’s fun, it’s cool! 
I expect you to be good... Don’t you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced... 
You’ve got good things. 
My papa and mama are high-skill Trainers, too.
It’s in my lineage! 
Papa, Mama! I’m so sorry! 
I go all out in battle, no matter what.
The inevitable conclusion! 
I concede! 
This is it! The biggest battle in my life! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah! 
This sets me back to being a Lass... 
My love of nature and Pokémon made a Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too! 
Ooh... I still love to battle, too. 
Hi! Have you ever considered a career as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your skill level. 
Yes, you’ve got the mettle. Being a Ranger is a lot of fun! 
Win or lose, a battle happens only once!
Do you have any regrets? 
I have no regrets! 
It’s my sworn duty to protect nature and the Pokémon in it.
It’s a challenging life, but there’s a lot to enjoy every day. 
It’s a rewarding career. How does it sound to you? 
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking on you!
Well? Satisfied? 
Well, aren’t you tough? I’m a little stunned! 
I didn’t sleep while trying to come up with this new strategy!
My strategy worked! 
Oh, but... I really needed to sleep tonight... 
The credo of the Dragon Tamer! Number one!
In victory, roar! Roar with your dragon! 
Even in defeat, roar! Roar with your dragon! 
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am! 
...Urf... I wanted to be strong... 
See it! Feel it! The ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the ultimate... Probably! 
The title of the ultimate probably! I confer it on you! 
Oh, wow! Rare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That’s what you get for letting down your guard. 
Tch. Couldn’t fool you. 
I can’t stand getting cold, but I’m quite good.
Ch-chatter... Wa-wahaha. I won, I won! 
Ch-chatter... Urr... I’m getting sleepy... 
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me! Not too shabby! 
I like the sense you show! 
Snow is wonderful! Everything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic! 
I’m whiting out... 
Don’t you think this coat is cute? It limits my movements, though.
It’s toasty warm. 
I feel snowed under... 
I’m the one! Number one out of all the kids in shorts!
See? That’s what being number one is about! 
Darn... I’m number one... 
I’m the one! The only one true one among shorts-wearing kids!
See? That’s what being the only one is about! 
Darn... I’m the only one... 
Um... I’m pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won? Um? S-sorry. 
Er, um... Th-thank you... 
Here goes!
Bravo! 
Yelp! 
You learn too!
The harsh realities of battling! 
The joy of victory! 
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn. 
I get it now. In that situation, I should have used that move. 
My teacher gave me advice on battling.
My teacher was right! That was just so easy! 
Aww, my teacher was wrong! None of it worked! 
Why are we battling? I don’t get it.
Why? I don’t understand. 
Why did you win? What happens now? 
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another brand. You know who’ll win, right?
I’m not interested in what was an inevitable result. 
But how... My... The Pokémon I’ve raised... 
There isn’t anything that I can’t buy. Money can buy battles!
There’s nothing that money can’t buy. 
I’ll give you my allowance if you’ll let me win. 
You know, I’m really not cut out for doing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah! 
You swine! Now I’m steamed! 
I’ll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done! 
Lickety-split is how I’ll excuse myself! 
Crunch-crunch... Crunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies... 
What am I standing on? Busted Poké Balls? 
The way of the Bug Catcher! Bear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher! 
All hail Bug Catchers! 
Feast your eyes on secret techniques of the ancients!
See? What did you think? Are you awestruck? 
That’s my cue to disappear in a puff of smoke. 
I see it!
Think not ill of me... 
Gyoeeeh! 
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah! 
Pi pika... 
A battle, you say? I’m never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee! I won, I won! 
Urk... We lost... 
It’s my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank! 
Ugagaah! You rotten thief! 
You can shake hands with me! It would be quite the honor for you!
If you’d won, I would have even given you my autograph! 
My management team will have something to say about this! 
Run! Don’t think! Run!
Faster! More! More! Faster! 
Run! Keep running for me! 
Hiya. Nice to meet ya.
All right. Nice seeing ya. 
All right. Thanks for coming by. 
My cohorts call me the emperor of fishing!
I landed another big one today! 
Why the emperor of fishing? It’s an ancient Chinese legend... 
When you get as good as me, you can win easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz... 
Sssnore... 
My mom and I travel around in search of lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and tend to crops every single day. 
You sure seem to be hectic. 
Win! That’s what I’ll do again today! I’ll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha! I’m not gonna lose my whole life! 
Nooooo! No way! I didn’t lose! 
Allow me to examine your prowess as a collector.
You’re still wanting. I urge you to keep at it. 
That’s quite the collection. I’m willing to relieve you of the lot. 
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir! 
Owowowoooh! 
I want you to hear it! A shout from the heart!
I love music! 
Let’s hear it for an encore! 
Battle? I’m up for that.
Wow. Good stuff. 
Thanks much. 
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap! 
I’m gonna pluck you for that! 
Sure, let’s duke it out!
Let’s battle again! 
You’re not half bad! 
Looking out over the sea’s breaking waves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar! Daddy! 
Wroaaaar! Mommy! 
Come on! Take a run at me! I can take it!
So, what’d you think? I was too burly for you to handle? 
Good job! Way to overcome my size! 
Waah! Wait! Wait a second! My mind’s not into this yet!
Hunh? It’s over already? What? I won, you say? 
Huh? Hah? It’s over already? What? I lost, you say? 
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk. Got some?
Wahaha! I get the win! Let’s celebrate over some Moomoo Milk! 
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk! Bring me some Moomoo Milk! 
You’re under arrest! You’re under arrest!
Takedown! 
Officer down! 
I’m not a real Policeman. I’m a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you. You should try to find one you like. 
I must say, battling is a wonderful thing. 
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the next. That’s how it goes. 
I might win tomorrow. That’s what I believe. 
I’m throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo! 
It’s over! 
The indefatigable Camper makes his stand!
You can become a devotee if you’d like. 
I wish I could become your devotee. 
I don’t think I have any chance of winning, but sure, I’ll battle.
Wow, I wasn’t expecting to win. 
I knew I’d lose. I’m so sorry for this. 
I think you’re awfully interested in me, aren’t you?
You lost because you were paying too much attention to me. 
Why did you win? I thought you liked me. 
Win or lose, let’s not bear any grudges.
Yay, yay, yay! We did it! 
Oh, you! Don’t ever forget this! 
Pokémon are for adults, too... Let me show you...
What do you think? Am I deep like an old blues man? 
Though it cuts me deep, it’s a man’s lot in life to endure the pain... 
What I have here isn’t really a guitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt... 
This here is a keyboard synth. 
For work, I sometimes get to be a Swimmer or a Beauty.
An Idol can become anybody! 
But the real me... I’m still a Lass in a miniskirt! 
Let’s enjoy ourselves. I hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun! 
Yowch! Watch it! You play too rough! 
I’ll put an end to this! With my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is complete and perfectly strong... 
Why? Why?! Why did I lose?! 
Living with Pokémon... Every day is the greatest.
Ehehe... Pokémon are the best... 
It’s not a problem if I lose. I still have my Pokémon... 
I have my Pokémon. I don’t need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy every day. 
Isn’t that the same for you? Isn’t it? 
You won’t guess it now, but I was quite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know. 
I feel nostalgic for those days... 
Do your best! My beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done! Mama’s proud of you! 
My Pokémon are my beloved family. 
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which. Let’s do this!
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which, but sorry. 
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which, but you’re sure tough! 
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it’s over. 
Too much for me to handle! 
We’re going for the win! Hey-ho, let’s go!
Yay! Vavavoom! 
Aww, we lost... Sniffle... 
Let me introduce to you my cherished partners!
How did you find them? My cherished partners. 
Awawa... My partners... 
Winning and losing isn’t all there is to battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when I win. 
The effort you put in is what’s important. 
It’s no good to be too harsh... But pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep and complex challenge. 
Balance is key for raising good Pokémon. 
I’ll check how your Pokémon have grown for you.
Not good enough! Your training style’s not up to par. 
This is impressive! You’ve raised your Pokémon really thoroughly. 
I’ll win. No lie.
See? 
Huh! 
Fwaah! Fwaah! You think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah! I win! 
Fwaah! 
I’ve caught you now. Give up.
You weren’t bad. Let’s meet again. 
How could this be...? 
Yo, yo! Let’s have a fun time!
Thank you! Let’s play again! 
Thanks! Play with me again! 
You’re no good at all. I’d better teach you.
No, no, this won’t do at all. Up on your feet. Never give up! 
You’ve got good skills. You tried hard, too. Excellent! 
I’m jacking up the power to max! All the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I’m feeling electric! 
Eeyow! I got zapped! 
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak! Keep trying! 
Hoh! You are tough! Give me a rematch! 
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That’s it? 
OK... Quite remarkable... 
Ahaha! Too bad for you! I’m your opponent!
Ahaha! 
Aha... Ahaha... 
Are you nervous? Leave it to the dude!
That was a good battle. I hope we can meet again. 
Whew... The dude wasn’t expecting to lose. 
The power of nature! Let me show you!
This is the power of nature! 
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
See? I thought this would happen. 
Boo! Boo! This is not right! 
Fuhahaha! Your next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you could defeat me? 
Fuhahaha! Let us meet again! 
Off you go! Face my team of totally trained Pokémon!
Bravo! I knew my Pokémon would do it! 
Oh, no! That’s awful! What have you done to my Pokémon?! 
A battle is deadly earnest! Not a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard! 
I seemed to have let my mind wander... 
Hey!
Heeey! 
Hey... 
I’m tough, that’s all.
I won, that’s all. 
I lost, that’s all. 
Shaah!
Hwooh! 
Hawah! 
I’ve been here for years, but I never get tired of this.
You might not think so, but I’m still a kid. I’m in the same grade as you. 
I’d like to keep battling Pokémon even when my hair is gray. 
Let me make one thing clear... You aren’t capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible chance of you beating me. 
How could this be...? Only that girl with the inflatable tube has beaten me... 
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days... So careless. 
Children these days... Quite exuberant, methinks. 
I would like my children to become strong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn’t do if my children were only as good as you... 
It would be nice if they were as skilled as you... 
Behold you shall! Psychic-mystifying power!
You see? Psychic-mystifying power! 
No, but... Psychic-mystifying power... 
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family! That’ll be enough already! 
My beloved family... 
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy? 
Ooorgh... My head’s spinning... 
My big brother told me! Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it! My big brother’s plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower the foe’s accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough. This is gonna be fun!
I thought so! You are tough! 
Yup, you sure are tough. Keep it up! 
Ah, welcome! I’m your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill? 
Thank you so much! 
Hello. Whatcha having?
Thanks a million! 
Be seeing ya! 
I love cute customers like you! I’ll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way I served you? 
Oh, but... I’m not done serving you. 
Stare...
You’ve got something on your nose. 
You’re cool, all right. I had to stare. 
I’ve waited a long time for a Trainer like you to come along.
Yup, you’re as tough as I thought. You even had me in trouble! 
I knew it! You are a tough Trainer! 
Now how should I conduct this offensive?
Oh, now I need a better effort out of you than that. 
Oh, you’re finished and content? OK, another time, then. 
My Pokémon have a different taste from the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference? My party has rich depth. 
Did you notice the difference? My party is refreshingly dry. 
Hiya! Tough-looking Trainer, aren’t you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling up in me! 
Ooch... You’re too much to handle. 
Varrroooom! Watch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom! I’m not close to redlining! 
Vrrr... Vrruuu... I’m flat out of gas... 
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech! 
Thud! 
It’s my dream to cycle with my boyfriend.
No riding double, though! 
I wish I had a boyfriend! 
What’s your motive? What brought you here?
You lose. Now what will you do? 
Play it again. 
We’ll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique. 
I remain humbled... 
You’re serious? A battle? And that’s against me?
Cackle! You shouldn’t have tried! 
Double wow! 
I’ll dance and sing and rivet your attention!
Ooh, baby! 
So much for riveting your attention. You nailed my Pokémon! 
Ready, start!
First across the finish line! 
Waah! Wait for me! 
Can you explain why I’m here?
I mean, who are you? 
Why am I battling here? 
My fishing-rod-handling technique is the best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it? Surprised, I bet! 
How I handle my fishing rod has nothing to do with battling... 
The two loves of my life are fishing and battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big fish or win a big battle. 
I was born to fish and battle! 
I come here on a ship. Big ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like. Very nice place. 
You want go to sea? My ship, we will see wonderful things. 
Huh? You’re my opponent? This is kind of unnerving...
I’m surprised... I didn’t think I’d win. 
See, I told you... I thought you were tough. 
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming! 
Thanks for your time! 
Let’s be good sports about this! Big smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha! Come on, you laugh too! 
I’m cheerful even in defeat! Ahaha! Ahaha! 
Buck up.
Not bad. 
You’re good. 
The sweetest thing about battling? The finishing blow!
Take that! That’s my finishing move! 
Oof... I feel your final shots... 
Hey, you’re looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right? 
Hey, you’re kind of tough. 
Listen! This is my chorus group. Me and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop! 
Oh, wait! We’re not done singing! 
I got tips from my online friends on how to best raise my gang.
I must thank my online friends. I don’t know who they are, though. 
Well, this blows! My online buddies let me down! 
Can I have a moment? I’m trying to write some email.
I need to get home quick and check on my email. 
What do you think you’re doing? I want to go already. 
Father... Mother... Please watch over me...
Father... Mother... Were you watching...? 
Father... Mother... Please forgive me... 
Can’t rightly say I much like battling, I tell you.
I won, but... I’m still shaking... 
Grr... I’m so angry I could cry... 
It’s the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed? That’s the power of science! 
It’s inconceivable... How could the power of science be defeated? 
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the fruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory! I’ll get my professorship now! 
What kind of experiments? That’s classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for this battle.
Googoo gagga. 
Gagga... 
Fwahahaha! You’ve come a long way!
Fwahahahaha! 
Fwahahaha! You’re blessed to have your friends! 
I’ll scrap you.
I’ll recycle you. 
Think ecology. Think green. 
Why, sure! Sounds great! We have to do this!
Bam! All done! 
A battle while working... It’s a good way to take a break. 
I’ll try to do my best! Please give me this chance!
I’ve done it! I’ve achieved my goal! 
I tried the best I could! Thank you for your encouragement! 
A battle is... It is a love letter written in sand.
Did you understand what I’m trying to say? I guess you wouldn’t. 
Did you understand what I’m trying to say? I guess you wouldn’t. 
Hello, you there! Yes, you! Hold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn’t be out now. Go home, and be quick about it. 
You shouldn’t mess with a police officer like that. 
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble... Wait for me... Sssnork... 
Mutter... Ehehe... Ssssnore... 
Let’s keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes! 
You’re quite the Trainer yourself! 
A battle isn’t something you can calculate.
What’d I tell you? You win when you win. 
What’d I say, huh? You lose when you lose. 
There’s lots in life that doesn’t go the way you want.
Yippee! Things went my way! 
See...? 
There’s nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion! 
Farewell! 
I wait for tough Trainers here, come rain or shine.
Because of that, I’ve grown so very strong... 
Won’t a tough... No, forget that. I need a cool Trainer to come... 
This is for keeping the sun off.
I’m strong at battling, but I can’t take sunlight... 
I don’t want to roast my skin. 
Well... Those are rare Pokémon...
I’ve never caught those... Your Pokémon are different, all right. 
Oh, you’re a Trainer? You’re not a Pokémon? 
Ready?
Cool. 
Bye. 
Beat me? Try again in another ten years!
No spine! 
You’re tough! You inspire me! 
Smelling sweet scents makes me so drowsy...
...Yawn... Oh? Are we finished so soon? 
...Yawn... Oh, really? I lost? 
You’re sure you can handle me? I’m an ultrastellar talent.
Don’t feel bad! I’m an ultrastellar talent! 
You’re in the miracle-star class! 
I live only for battles. Only victories give me hope.
...Naturally. 
Who are you...? 
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what you’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again! 
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you... I can live with that. 
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what you’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again! 
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you... I can live with that.

===============================
And we’re off!
We did it, yeah! 
Uncle! 
My Pokémon are a cut apart from the usual. Maybe even two cuts!
Their cutting intensity and solid attack... Top class, yeah? 
Grr... Rendered harmless... 
The prince among shorts-wearing Youngsters, that is me!
I hope I lived up to my title of the prince among the shorts wearers. 
I can’t lose here! Not as the prince among the wearers of shorts! 
I can’t bear this tension. Would they be mad if I went home?
I did it! I won somehow! 
That’s gone past my limit! I need to be excused! 
I’m not very good at this, but please don’t hold back.
Oh, didn’t I say? You shouldn’t have held back. 
Fweh! I wish you would have held back a little bit! 
In romance, fashion, and Pokémon! Today’s girls want it all!
The greed of today’s girls knows no bounds! 
Did being greedy end up costing me everything? 
I’m thinking hard about why everyone likes battling so much.
Why does winning a battle make people happy? 
Why is losing a battle so downright infuriating? 
I’m trying to keep up with my Pokémon training and my own schooling.
I’d like to think I’ve struck the right balance of fun and education. 
This isn’t going to work? My grades are the best in class, but... 
I crammed hard for this. I can’t possibly fail!
Yes! I get the win! I’m glad I kept with this! 
It means I need to study at home some more. 
My Pokémon are my treasures. I’ll let you see them. Just you.
See? Cute and strong! Eheheheh. 
See? They’re cute even when losing. Eheheheh. 
I won’t lose ever! Please abide by my rule!
Thank you so much! I owe this win to you! 
I so did not want to lose... 
I can do this... I can shine here, too!
Yes! I won! I’m going to be a star! 
One day, I’m going to shine as the brightest star in the world! 
Don’t be shy. You can bring it any which way.
Yeah, I figured you’d be like this. Heh. 
W-well, sometimes I have to lose, just so I don’t crush everyone. Ahaha... 
My father’s wealthy. There’s nothing he can’t afford.
My father’s money bought my Pokémon. 
There are things that money can’t buy. I know that... 
Well, shall we? Time is money, and the meter is running.
Well, I’ll take my leave. Yet another fancy dinner date, you know. Adieu! 
It’s my loss, is it? So be it. I had to leave for a date anyway. 
Uphold the rules of etiquette and courtesy... That’s what a lady does.
If I couldn’t unwind this way, I would lose my ladylike composure. 
I wish I could be free like the bird Pokémon in the skies... 
If I were Honey, then you would be Gooey Mulch, I would think.
Do you see now? How different we are in level and class? 
How dare you! I won’t forget this humiliation ever! 
Partying, shopping, dining... Darling, I’ve grown bored of it all.
Excitement is so lacking in my life. What will send my heart racing? 
Only battling lifts me from this idle existence of boredom and apathy... 
I’m glad to make your acquaintance! May this friendship be fruitful!
Thank you very much! Thank you so very much! 
Thank you very much... ...Pah. 
The most natural Trainer is... Oh, why hide it? None other than me!
This is the natural outcome. It was inevitable! 
I was battling naturally, and ended up with the loss. 
Yes! Not a grown-up! Lucky me! I stand a chance!
Yup, battling another kid is a lot less scary. 
I get really nervous in front of grown-ups. 
It’s hard to keep the streak alive, but the battles are fun.
It’s more fun to win, of course! 
Even losing is fun. It’s the wonder of Pokémon! 
My daddy is a real mountain man. Does that make my mom a mountain woman?
Mountain woman sounds icky. Not for me, thank you! 
I’m their daughter. Is a mountain woman my destiny? 
I have a pack lunch all ready, and of course I have some snacks.
My favorite Pokémon make winning so easy! 
Oh, no, no! I forgot to bring my favorite Pokémon! 
I frolic with my water Pokémon in a pool all the time.
It sure makes me happy winning with my Pokémon favorites. 
I’d love to swim in a pool full of water Pokémon. 
I promised Mommy I’ll practice swimming if I lose.
Yay! I won’t have to go to the pool with Mommy today! 
Aww, I lost. Now I’ll have to go to swimming practice today. 
I went and caught my Pokémon with my daddy.
I won, Daddy! Daddy, thank you! 
I wonder if Daddy will show me how to train my Pokémon next? 
I’m on the way home from the pool, but OK, I can battle.
I hope I can go home soon. I need some dry clothes! 
Ah-ah-atchoo! Aww... Atchoo! We lost... 
I’m the captain of a heroic vessel among the crashing waves of a storm!
Made it to shore with the ease of a real swashbuckler! 
That was a bigger crash than I wanted! 
I just now got back from my vacation.
The beach is a good place to show off. 
Ooh, my sunburn is itching. 
Hunh? A battle, is that it? Sure thing, sure thing.
Hey, you’re something special, huh? 
Yeah, thanks for your time. 
This is going out to all the ladies. Babes, I sing and battle for you!
My ladies, my babes, I won for you. Your love is my power, right? 
I lost, but my love for the babes can’t be beat, maybe. 
This is no guitar I have here. It’s traditional and Japanese.
It has only three strings. Can you tell what this is? 
My instrument, it’s called a shamisen. 
We teen Idols have a secret code of conduct that’s strictly enforced.
For example, if an Idol wins, she has to squeal and jump around. 
If an Idol loses, she must never act angry. That’s a big no-no. 
Do the monster Meteor Mash! It’s my catchphrase!
My Meteor Mash goes to your heart! 
All Idols need a catchphrase, especially right after their debut. 
You’re ever so lucky to get the chance to battle with me.
You’re super lucky to even battle an Idol like me. Don’t you get it? 
Huh? Huh? Now, why did you win? You know I’m supposed to win? 
Krink... Krak... Heheheh. Let me limber up for this.
Hah! Weak, even for a joke! 
Gnnrrr... I have only myself to blame... 
Aren’t they pretty? Adorable? They’re my beloved Pokémon.
You worked so hard! I’ll give you a nice massage at home. 
What are you doing to my Pokémon?! What if you hurt them?! 
I come before you as a member of the Pokémon Fan Club! En garde!
Long live the Pokémon Fan Club! May it always be glorious! 
This is hardly a taste of what the Pokémon Fan Club can bring down... 
Fan Club Department Manager... I hereby accept your challenge.
Heheh... Honestly, you thought you stood a chance against the Fan Club? 
Gwah! I will be avenged... B-by the Division Manager... 
Raising Pokémon with love isn’t the same as coddling them. Don’t you see?
Ooh, you did it! Oh, I love you so! My luvly, wuvly Pokémon! 
How could you?! What if my Pokémon are injured?! 
On behalf of my village, I take on this challenge!
Thank you, everyone! Thank you for your vocal support! 
Fellow villagers, I’m sorry! My best wasn’t enough! 
Thank you for your patience. Here is the battle you’d ordered.
I trust you were satisfied? I feel shortchanged somewhat. 
I trust you were satisfied? I’ve had my fill. 
Work is fun, and Pokémon also. I am happy I come to this country.
Having fun I am! I hoping to live here forever. 
Oh, why you beat me? So mean! I want go home to my country. 
I’m cool, right? So, everywhere I work, they make me the maitre d’...
I’m a good battler, too. I can’t help it that the ladies fall for me. 
I dream of evolving from a maitre d’ to a celebrity chef. 
There are no free deals on a battle. You’ll get the full course, though.
Where’s the fun if you don’t battle like you mean it? 
I take work and play seriously. That’s what sparks my passion! 
Hi, may I interest you in a meal combo? ...I’m so used to saying that at work!
Thank you, and have a great day! ...What am I saying? 
We look forward to your next visit! ...What am I thinking? 
Your team looks impressive. Will I be OK...?
Oh, what? Are those Pokémon only for Contests? 
Ouch! I said ouch! It was too much! Way, way too much! 
I love bug Pokémon! I love my bug net even more!
I caught my Pokémon using my trusty bug net. 
It’d be cool if there was a bug net Pokémon. 
The bugs are my minions, and I’m the boss. Are you prepared to lose?
Wahaha! Well done, my minions! 
We were mowed down... My minions have learned the hard way! 
I’m breaking out of my shell! I’m taking it to the next level!
It’s like I’ve sprouted wings! Viva to the new me! 
Is it not my time yet? Do I need to stay in my shell longer? 
You transgressor! Hold still, I say!
I willed myself to victory! 
C-curses... I’ve brought dishonor on us... 
Hey, hey, what’s that over there? It’s... It’s a legendary Pokémon!
Kekeke... Ninjutsu misdirection! It worked to perfection! 
Ninjutsu misdirection was a failure! I’ll disappear in a puff of smoke! 
You’ll be befuddled by my dazzling speed!
Your movements... It’s as if you’re moving in molasses. 
I didn’t need to do all that dashing around, did I? 
I’ve been wearing these clothes for a long time. Bathing is for the birds!
Changing clothes takes too much effort. Taking a bath is even worse! 
No, no, no! I won’t take a bath! 
I like my mommy, PIKACHU, and my daddy, too.
A weak Trainer isn’t cool. I don’t like you. 
A not-wimpy Trainer is cool. I like you. 
Pikapika pikaah! Pikka! Pikachuuuh!
Piika pikapikka! Pikka pikkachuuh! 
Pikka ppi pi piii... 
When I enter battle, I picture the vast sea in my mind.
When I can envision the sea, I feel as if I could never lose. 
When I envision the sea, I don’t feel the sting of defeat. 
In battle and in love, one needs to know when it is best to back off.
After all, both battle and romance can become quagmires of despair. 
I may have lost, but I said something deep, in an endless bog kind of way. 
I’m afraid I got cursed on our last exploration of ancient ruins. Ehehe.
Even just now, I have no idea how I won. Heeheehee. 
I may be cursed, but this is fun. It is all so very good. Heeheehee. 
Seeing buildings and towns from the old ages sends my pulse racing.
People interested in old architecture are potential Ruin Maniacs.
Open your eyes in towns. There will be exciting new discoveries. I mean it.
I put this team together with my Internet buddies. It took us all day!
We won! I need to thank my Internet buddies for their advice! 
Aww, darn it! We lost?! I’ll report it to my Internet buddies! 
I’m the main character of this story. It’s impossible for me to lose.
You’re good! Though, as a supporting character, you’re a bit too strong. 
...The hero has to suffer a bit so the audience feels more empathy. 
I’m very fickle. I can’t stick with any one thing for very long.
I won, and it’s enough for me. I’m going to check out the Wi-Fi Plaza. 
I lost, so that’s enough. I’ll go dig Spheres in the Underground. 
I have a ton more experience than you. What will you do about it?
Not bad, but you need more maturing. 
Experience alone doesn’t ensure any wins, I’m learning. 
Don’t you think Pokémon battles are a lot like the weather?
Winning makes me feel warm and cheerful like a sunny day. 
Losing makes me sad like a dreary, cloudy day. 
I was out all night at a party again. I’m feeling dizzy from playing games!
I’m so bored of fancy parties and silly games, too. 
Urp...! 
Ooh, aren’t you the most darling thing! Can you win a smile from me?
Ooh, sweetie, I win, so no smile! Be sure to win next time! 
I don’t feel like smiling now...but I’ll be happy to wave good-bye! 
...Oh, wait one second. I have to take this call.
Hi, yup... Yah, battling... Uh-huh... Yup, I won... Well, duh... LOL... 
Hi, yup... Yes, just battled... Nope... Kid beat me... Uh-huh... 
Snivel! Hnurrff! Snort! This hay fever is a wicked misery...
Hnurrff! Snivel! Snivel! Snivel! I won, but the misery continues! 
Sniffle. Snivel. Snort. I’m not crying. My nose is running. 
My acute sense of smell tells me how tough a Trainer is.
Keep trying. My nose tells me you have great potential. 
Sniff, sniff... Snort! My nose tells me you’ve been working hard! 
Kyahaha! I smell a powerful battle in the making!
The sweet smell of success! 
Defeat smells like a SKUNTANK! 
I like hard, fast beats in my battling and my rock ’n’ roll! Let’s wail!
And, bam! That rhythm pattern ruled, if I may say so myself! 
Ouch! That’s an insult to the ears! Those beats were offensive, man! 
To show you how much this means to me, I’ll use sound effects from now on.
Raaaah! Dun dun! Dun dun! Oompa-oompa-oompapa! 
Blip-bip, blip-bip... Blip... Bweeee... 
Wait, please wait... The winds... I hear them...
I can hear them... The winds are laughing... 
I can hear them... The winds... They are in tears... 
I can’t fly... But these babies can soar...
My spirit has been uplifted to the skies... Thank you, everyone... 
You broke my wings... I won’t ever forget you... 
Every day, I’m like a migratory bird, but I go in all cardinal directions.
I gained experience while traveling to all sorts of places. 
I’d love to live somewhere where I can find other Trainers like you. 
I was born unto rolling waves that washed me, with the beach, my cradle.
I was born and grew up on the seas. That’s what made me the big man I am. 
I lost, did I? Time to go to the sea and stare inscrutably at it.
Youths of today aim for the world! How’s that for deep!
There’d be some mighty cool Trainers around the world. I’m sure of that. 
Go on, kid! Take on the world! I’ll look forward to your return! 
What’s that? I smell dusty? Don’t you know the aroma of soil?
See, that’s what you get! Your team had to eat dirt, get it? 
Dropped in the dirt by some kid who doesn’t know the smell of soil! 
Sorry for looking so scruffy and dirty. I’ve been holed up in the mountains.
I wasn’t really holed up, at least not on purpose. I was lost out there. 
It’s better to be holed up in the mountains than in your room, I say. 
I’m not supposed to be here. Can we do this on the sly?
Even battling can draw attention. It’s not easy being a pop star. 
Pop stars are ordinary girls at heart. We want to enjoy our Pokémon, too! 
I’m a self-made celebrity. Do you have a problem with that?
A celebrity is a celebrity, even if it’s in my own mind. 
I want to be the center of attention, just me and only me. 
I’m facing retirement soon... I was never admired as an Idol.
I’m going to shine as a star battler of Pokémon! 
I would have liked to end my career with a win in this match...
I think training Pokémon shares a lot of similarities with a marathon. You?
There’s meaning in sticking with your training regimen every day. 
If you don’t pace yourself, you can’t win. 
Howdy! Let’s keep it clean, fair, refreshing, and pleasant!
Whew, I feel invigorated! Pokémon are the greatest! 
Uh, haha...ha... It actually feels kinda cleansing to be thrashed this badly. 
It’s the Workers of the world like us who keep the world going.
There are times we would like to lay down our tools and rest. 
Don’t forget how Workers like us work for you. 
My wife and boy are waiting on me back home. I can’t afford to lose!
I’m sorry, but I had to do this. You’ll get tougher with a family behind you. 
Oh, no! How am I supposed to show my face around my dear wife and boy now? 
Pokémon are like family to me. ...Nah, they are family.
Yes! My family, you did it! We knocked off that mean Trainer! 
Fwaaaah! That’s cruel! My family’s hurting! 
I was too lenient with my Pokémon. They grew up all selfish on me.
Hey, now, enough. Stop attacking! The battle’s long over already. 
Hey, now, the battle’s over and done. No attacking the Trainer. 
You, there. Don’t look around now. Pay attention to me. Focus.
Kid, you’re grossly underpowered. You ought to train with me. 
Oh, yeah. You’re better than you look. I was wrong about you, kid. 
Go, my Pokémon. But don’t strain yourselves.
Oh, wow, I like how tough everyone was. Our Pokémon and you, yup. 
OK, nice try, gang. Thanks much for trying. 
My papa’s dream... I’m going to make it real.
Papa, did you see? We did it all for you... 
We lost... Papa, I am so sorry... 
I’d like to take a break. ...No? We have to begin right away?
Aww, see? You should have taken a break with me before. 
Ooh, aren’t you a tough one? You should take breaks, though. 
Yes, yes, looking good! I need a smile now. Can you do that?
No, no, no. I need a smile from you. Let’s see those teeth sparkle! 
Yes, that’s a good smile! Now tilt your head toward me. 
You probably can’t tell, but I can see right down to your pores.
Yes, I see it, indeed. I can see you clearly. 
I zoomed in on you too much. I couldn’t see your Pokémon. 
While battling, I’ll keep looking for the best shot of you.
There! And there again! Decisive moments in time! 
Shots of me losing? Those get deleted immediately. 
I’ll be bringing you live coverage from my imminent battle!
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has carried the day! Go, me! 
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has gone down in defeat. Take pity on me! 
I hate admitting it, but I wanted to be an Idol, too.
I didn’t want to lose to any Idol. That motivated me to train. 
This is crushing... I work so much harder than any silly Idol... 
This microphone is what made me a star. It’s my all and everything.
Even for a battle, I don’t let this microphone leave my hand. 
...Thud. Bzzzzt... 
Hey, ’sup. I should warn you, I’m right fast, Trainer. Hold on to your hat.
Trainer, from now on, you can start adding Mister to my name. 
Trainer, that was a real learning experience. Thank you, seriously. 
This bike has become an extension of my very being.
Any damage to my bike, I feel the pain as if it were mine to bear. 
Please! I’ll ask you to keep your filthy hands off my bike. 
When I was little, I hated cycling. I couldn’t get the hang of it.
I love cycling now. I’ve made many friends riding. 
Can you ride a bike? It’s healthy and a lot of fun. 
I’ll ride toward the breaking dawn with you on my mind.
I will shift my gears higher and higher until I catch up to you... 
My tires have deflated, and so has my heart... 
Let the curtains rise on the festivities of muscles and Pokémon!
Did you enjoy our demonstration of muscle and Pokémon? 
Though I’ve lost, my muscles and Pokémon are seared into your mind. 
They say I have fists of steel and the heart of a child.
Oh, yay! Yippee! I won, I won! 
Oh, boo! Boo! This stinks! I’m not talking to you! 
Hwoaaah... Hwoaaah...
Howatchah! Howaaatchaah! 
Fweeeh... Fweeehhh... 
In my dictionary, there is no entry for “restraint.”
The greatest show of respect among Trainers is to battle all out. 
I went all out and still lost. Of course it stings. 
A professional martial artist is in perpetual control of his body.
A martial artist must be more than strong. He must also be wise. 
Gah! I overdid my training and ran out of stamina early... 
When I close my eyes, I can picture you being defeated. Come on.
Why be sad? You knew this was coming. 
I berate myself for my own lack of care... 
I don’t like to move much. I trained using the Net and TV.
Uhihi! I’m a naturally talented pro at both karate and Pokémon, I am. 
Oh, man, this is rotten! I’m tired and hungry and want to go home! 
...To get this far, I had to make sacrifices. Many, many sacrifices.
It’s for this one moment that I live. 
What else do I have to give up so I can beat you? 
First, let’s battle. Talking can wait.
That wasn’t bad at all, yup. That goes for you and your Pokémon. 
You’re a tough one, yup. Where do you do your training? 
Cute little Trainer! We’ll squash you flat.
Eheh! You’re so cute when you look angry and frustrated! 
What do you think you’re doing? I hate to lose, I’ll have you know! 
My precious Pokémon will set you right!
My Pokémon have no flaws that you can exploit! 
I apologize, my dear Pokémon... I was caught unprepared... 
Fwo-fwo-fwo. Youngster, what’s most important is to never give up.
If you give up, that’s it. The game’s over. 
Fwo-fwo-fwo. You’re an admirable Trainer already. 
I can tell by the way you look, you’re quite taken with my dandy style!
You shouldn’t be so mesmerized by me. Like a MOTHIM drawn to a flame! 
Oh, you’re not interested in me? You’re just SHELLOS, if I say so myself. 
Oh, hello, aren’t you a sweetie! Are you sure you’re up to this?
Oh, now, please don’t cry. You should be proud of yourself, dear. 
Oh, my... You’re quite the capable practitioner of the art. 
You and your Pokémon could use an obedience lesson from me.
This isn’t over until I say. Once more. 
You defy me? How very amusing. 
Over the years, I’ve crossed paths with many a Trainer.
They were all wonderful Trainers in their own ways. All fond memories now... 
You’re one among those many Trainers. I’m sorry I wasn’t younger. 
I am a Psychic, though I may not look like one. I’ll do something psychic.
I didn’t use any psychic power to win. No, really. 
Did you notice? I was levitating while I was in battle with you. 
Fwazzam! So! You are my next victim!
Fwazzam! Have you no spine?! 
Fwizzle... Don’t think there will be a next time!
I can use psychic power, but I prefer ordinary sleight-of-hand magic tricks.
It’s my opinion that psychic power should be left to the Pokémon. 
I’m a Psychic, but I’m also a student of a magician’s school. 
In the next few minutes, you will learn true terror at my hands!
Hah! Too weak! Too weak! What pitiful resistance! 
Noooo! I cannot lose!
I see what I have no right seeing... Like there. Behind you.
Oh? You can’t see it? Then, you’re fortunate. Giggle... 
I wouldn’t ask about what I see. It’s better not to know. Really. 
The great unseeable power... I beseech you for help...
Oh, great unseeable power... I thank you for coming to my aid... 
Oh... Great unseeable power... Why have you forsaken me... 
Why do I raise Pokémon? Because they are there!
I think I said something deep and cool! Didn’t I? 
That’s no reason at all? That’s the reason in itself! 
My team has been raised with care. I have absolute confidence in them.
You should pay closer attention to the unique aspects of your Pokémon. 
How did you find my Pokémon? Did you notice their significance? 
Everyone, it’s showtime! Get out and do some clobbering!
Oh, bravo! Nicely won! 
Arrgh! How humiliating! Quick! Out of the spotlight! 
I love raising Pokémon. It’s what I live for!
Seeing them try so hard to please... It’s so unbearably adorable. 
Don’t you dare do that again! 
I’ve been devising ways of raising tough Pokémon from the genetic level.
You can’t overlook the role of knowledge in raising tough Pokémon. 
I need to study and understand what genetics is about first. 
Raise them with love, and Pokémon will answer in kind. Probably.
They responded to my love. Probably. 
You’re raising your Pokémon with a lot of love. I think. 
I believe I will approach this battle from the perspective of a newborn.
Abuboo dah. 
Ababaa. Manmaa. 
If you prevail, I’ll recount to you a tale from my youth.
Seeing you brings back a flood of memories. Ah, yes, indeed... 
...Hm? I seem to have forgotten... 
There’s no end to adolescence or Pokémon.
See ya! That was fun! Enjoy your youth! 
I’m still a dreamer. A precious, unspoiled snowflake... 
Daddy... Mommy... Can you hear me? Please watch over me...
Daddy... Mommy... Did you see? I won, and it’s all for you... 
Oh... Daddy... Mommy... I couldn’t win... 
Finally... The time has come to put the fruits of my research to the test...
Success... Sacrificing my youth was worthwhile. 
No! Nooooooo! Give me back my youth! 
I developed a special Pokémon drink. Have some! Bottoms up!
Glug, glug... Belch! It’ll make you strong! Don’t waste it! 
My Pokémon drink contains no actual Pokémon or their byproducts. 
An analogy for battling is... I’d say a bachelor guy.
Heheh, do you get it? I doubt you’d get it. No one does. 
Do you get what I’m saying? I doubt you’d get it. No one ever does. 
Myself, I have been born, raised, and spent my life under a circus tent.
My Pokémon, too. They were born and raised under a circus tent. 
The outside world is so very cruel... We shall return to our circus tent.
Oi, you! Yeah, you! Snap to it! I’ll be training you!
What?! You’re down and out already?! This is no bed! Get up! 
Good! Enough! That will do for today! 
Fwah? You mean to challenge me?
Fwahaha! I win! Better luck next time, punk! 
Fwaah?! You defeated me? Who are you to do that?! 
Ooh, it gives me shivers... I live for this moment.
Oh, yeah... That’s it... Perfection doesn’t come better... 
It’s gotten so I can’t live without battling anymore. 
OK! I’m going to do it! I’m going to show you my best!
Gasp, gasp... 
Never again! You can forget about a next time! 
Um... I’m honestly quite tough. Please keep up.
I’m sorry. I don’t think you measure up after all. 
I’m amazed. I didn’t think you’d win... 
Let’s go, me! Go, me, go! Don’t lose, don’t lose, rah, rah, rah!
Way to go, me! I’m so wonderful! Rah, rah, rah! Gooooooo, me! 
It’s OK, me! Don’t cry! Don’t cry! Go home, go home, goooooo! 
Woohoo! Here comes a cool Trainer! Let’s see what you can bring!
Yes! Bravo! You have some good attacks, Trainer! 
Whaaaaat?! Nooooo! I can’t get over how tough you are! 
To serve and protect Pokémon and nature. That’s my mission!
My skills I developed in the embrace of Mother Nature! 
My mission needs me! This is where we bid good-bye! 
Never fear, this Pokémon Ranger is here to protect my own personal peace!
My personal peace has been protected! 
You vile Trainer, you! You’ve shattered my peace! 
Any bad kids littering the fields? Any bad kids fouling the sea?
Be sure to sort your recyclables from the trash when you’re throwing it out!
Trash is like a battle. Don’t be too quick to throw it!
Watch me, darling! I’m putting my best into this!
See, darling? Did you see? I put in my best effort for you. 
I can’t have my darling see me like this. How pathetic I must look... 
So, I lead with this... Then, counter... Ugh, I can’t get our strategy right!
To overanalyze can be a bad thing, I guess. 
Waaah! Couldn’t you have waited? Until I’m ready at least? 
How do you like my cape? I had it specially made!
What is my cape made of? I’m afraid I can’t tell you. 
Rip... Riiiiiiiiiiiipppppp! ...What?! My cape! Waaaaah! 
Do you know what real terror is? I am familiar with it. Intimately so...
You learned something today, yes? The true meaning of terror. 
Aiyeeh! What’s with you? I’m pleading for mercy here! 
See it! Hear it! Smell it! Marvel at my power!
That’s right! Use all your senses and realize what you were up against! 
I didn’t see anything! I’m not listening! And I don’t smell a thing! 
Unluckily for you, your winning streak ends with me.
You lost to me, but you’re still on your feet. Kudos to you! 
This can’t be. I won’t accept it. There has to be a mistake somewhere. 
I c-c-can’t stop shivering. B-but this is a b-battle. I have to.
Urrff... Ch-chatter... I won, I won... 
Sh-shiver... Urf... My eyelids are getting droopy... 
I’ll say good-bye to you now. Battles always end in tears.
Fweeeeh! My tears of joy flow freely! 
Fweeeeh! My tears of anguish flow freely! 
How amusing! You came here knowing of your certain defeat?
Ahahahah! Very entertaining! I shall be happy to see you again! 
Wh-what is happening...? M-my vision is turning milky white... 
A Trainer am I, a new ray of hope from the land of the midnight sun.
In the frigid falls of the north, I honed my skills. With them, I made you fall. 
Your foul trickery deserves contempt. But effective it was, too. 
I’ve been pondering lately...how much longer will I be wearing shorts?
Will I still be in shorts as a grown-up? 
If I grow old like this, will they call me something silly like “Shorts Man”? 
That’s right, I’m the legendary kid in shorts who’s the talk of the town.
Even a Youngster in shorts like me can be the stuff of legend or two. 
My legend is over... 
Uh... Um... H-hello. P-pleased to meet you.
S-s-sorry. I’m r-really n-nervous. 
Uh... Th-thank you. That was f-fun. 
Oh, this place is so passé now. I’m missing out on shopping.
You’re kind of stylish, actually. Oh, I wish I had new clothes. 
Maybe I’ll collect accessories for some Contests... 
Exam season’s coming up, but I’m neck-deep in battling...
Mom’s going to cut me off. I just know it... 
I have to keep up on both my studying and Pokémon... 
Hiya, you Trainer there! Slip on some glasses. They’ll make you look better.
Nothing’s the matter with my eyes. I wear glasses for the looks I get. 
Whoops! My glasses, my glasses. 
I’ve been taught every opponent has a weakness. If I can find yours...
Eheheh. I figured out your weakness. 
Did you figure out my weakness? 
It’s been so long since I had my last battle.
You know, battling is fun after all. 
Battling is so much fun, but... 
The age of money has come to Pokémon battling. I’ll teach you who is right.
You understand, don’t you? What is right, and who is stronger? 
M-my Pokémon! What have you done? What am I to do?! 
You’re my opponent? Oh, all right... Try not to disappoint me too badly.
My Pokémon are all tops in luxury. Do you see? This is what power is about. 
Nyah! I don’t care! I’ve got enough  money to fill a swimming pool! 
You there. Yes, you. I’m feeling rather bored.
I suppose that was enjoyable for what it was. I’ll thank you for it. 
You are rather good. Quite remarkable, even. 
I can sink your sort with minimal effort.
It took the barest of effort to win this match. 
You swamped us with no effort at all... 
My room is always full of bugs. That drives my mom just wild.
I want to collect more bug Pokémon for my bug appreciation station. 
Bugs are loose under my shirt. I’m starting to itch... 
People claim I’m like an adult. Whatever could they mean, do you suppose?
Ah, yes, quite enjoyable! We must do this again, surely. 
Oh, yes! Smashing! That chilled me to my toes, it did! 
I have made my choice. When I fall, it shall be forward!
You lack conviction. 
...Thud. 
So, what exactly is a ninja, you may ask.
A ninja is powerful. That will do as a start. 
Maybe some ninjas are weak? 
I once saw a lady wearing the same outfit as me.
She said, “You’re showing serious fashion chops.” 
She said, “You’re kidding me, am I right?” 
Will you believe that inside this costume is a grown-up Beauty?
My dream is to live as a Pokémon one day. To become a Pokémon! 
I’m an adult, but I want to be a Pokémon. Does that make me weird? 
My profile’s riding high now, so my schedule’s filled solid!
Oh, no! It’s this late already? I’d better check my timetable! 
Talent manager! Do I have time for a rematch? 
Are you another of my fans? I can give you an autograph if you’d lose?
Here’s your autograph! Cherish it! Oh, sorry! I don’t do handshakes. 
I’m sorry, I was acting GASTLY! It was very DELCATTY of me! 
I need to diet. I have to get out jogging.
Well, I guess I’ll go for a quick trot around here... 
Your Pokémon know how to punch hard. You see, I’m really a boxer. 
I look to bug Pokémon for hints on running all the time.
I admire the light and agile footwork of bug Pokémon. 
Skitter... 
Listen, I’m feeling bushed today. Can we do this tomorrow first thing?
Oh, all right. You’re impatient. Couldn’t wait till tomorrow, oh no. 
That’s why I said tomorrow. I can barely stay awake now. 
Feed the Pokémon you catch, or they will flee. Do you see?
Once a Pokémon has fled, it will never return. Do you see? 
What I said about Pokémon, it is a parable. Do you see? 
When I was younger, I went out on digs chasing rumors of hidden treasures.
Of course, there are no such things. But it’s about chasing a dream. 
Well, it sure left huge holes... In the ground and in my bank account. 
I’ll launch an avalanche of moves! I’ll test your limits of endurance!
Well, Trainer? Should I try out some more moves? 
That’s it! I’m all out of stock! I’d like you to leave so I can close up! 
I collect and battle Pokémon so I can brag to my peers.
I’m not all that interested in winning or losing to begin with. 
You’ve won the battle. But, in terms of the Pokémon involved, I clearly win.
Did you want to see my Pokémon? OK, sure. Just a peek, though.
How’s that for classy? My Pokémon are tops in both moves and character. 
Hold it right there! You can look, but don’t touch! 
Rock? Samba? Traditional folk? I can play in any style. It’s all good!
Music and Pokémon uplift me! I’m carried up among the stars! 
Sigh... I’m seeing stars... You’ve got me singing the blues... 
Let my exquisite melody ring out! Hear my Pokémon shout out!
The melody from my Pokémon and me... Did it reach out and touch your heart? 
I’ve been known to throw matches, but I’ll never throw a guitar on stage! 
I’m free like a bird! I feel like I could fly!
That’s how I ended up becoming a Bird Keeper. 
Like most birds, I can’t see very well at night. 
As a Trainer, I’m as fragile as an egg. Please be gentle on me.
Do you think I’m getting ready to take flight? 
One of these days, I’ll break out of my shell and defeat you. 
Bear witness to my display of machismo and masculinity!
There! That’s how a real man lives and battles! 
Waaaah! Waaaah! Mommy! 
I’ve got a showdown coming up with a Hiker. Let me see if I’m ready!
Yep, I’d say my team’s about ready. That Hiker won’t know what hit him! 
Aww, blast it, no! I can’t beat that Hiker like this! 
My showdown against a man of the sea draws near! Let me test my team!
Everything went as calculated... Be ready for me, man of the sea! 
Beating the man of the sea is impossible with an outcome this lame... 
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi! This dance I use to psych myself up.
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi! So much fun, I cannot stop. 
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi! I dance to stem my tears from losing... 
I’m not really with the police. I’m a collector of uniforms.
Battling as a Policeman made for a very fun battle, it did. 
That’s it for me. I bid you a fond farewell. 
I’m a Policeman. But on holidays, I’m an entirely different kind of guy.
Usually, I chase after bad guys as a Policeman. 
On my days off, I chase after the waves and the ladies as a Swimmer. 
Perseverance pays off. A case can turn on that.
It makes for more excitement when you come from behind to take the win. 
That was more thrilling than any stakeout! Thanks for that! 
My present case can go either way. It’s a coin toss.
So, I won this time... All decided by a fickle coin... 
Best two out of three? 
I live in the woods. You know, I’m a Camper.
I’m working on making camp life more comfortable. 
I am sick and tired of camping out in the woods... 
No, no, I can’t do this! I’m not cut out for battling!
Oh, wow! I won! What’ll I do? You’re not mad at me, are you? 
See! I told you before we started! Battling just isn’t for me. 
Trainer spotted! It’s time to get cooking!
A battle should be enjoyed like a tasty meal! 
I ended up getting cooked! 
Fweeoo-fwee-fwee-fyoo... I saunter into battle, whistling...
Too easy! I was whistling all the way through that. 
Fwee-ooo fwee-ooo fwee-ooo... I switched to an ambulance siren... 
I can hear it... The screaming adulation of 100,000 fans rising in unison...
Right on, everyone! You saw that! I dedicate my win to you! 
You’re scorching... You’ve made a fan out of me. 
Number one worldwide, that’s my dream. Well, to start, anyway.
“Number one worldwide,” now doesn’t that have a good ring to it? 
I can’t quite decide what I should be number one worldwide at. 
I’m not some cheap Idol! I’m an actress! Please remember that!
My career isn’t anything like your typical Idol’s career! 
I’m an actress... It sounds so deliciously right... 
We’re not here for a long time, so let’s make it a good time!
Thank you! That was soooo fun! I really hope we can battle again! 
It makes me sad having to say good-bye... Please come see me again! 
I am the Fan Club Division Manager... Bring your best to bear...
Kneel before the might of the Fan Club! 
Gweh! But I did my best! Regrets, I have none! 
I welcome you, young Trainer. Allow me to demonstrate my power.
Young Trainer, do you have any idea what my power signifies? 
You’ve surpassed me in your love of Pokémon. You’re the truest of fans. 
I think I’ll try out the TM the woman next door gave me.
I am impressed. That woman actually gave me something useful. 
Oh, that nasty woman! This TM is worthless! 
I heard that! I may be old enough to be your mom, but I’m still young!
Look at my skin tone and Pokémon! Both firm, but supple! 
Please don’t make that mistake again! I’m young, I tell you! 
Whether it be work or play, I’m with my Pokémon all day.
Life without Pokémon? I can’t picture that. 
It’s like I’m married to my Pokémon. I’m not married, though. 
You get to be the best by working harder than everyone else.
I reckon I’ve been a hard worker. 
Work at battling over and over. Your star will shine one day. 
I’m going to become famous here so I can rebuild the ranch.
I can’t lose. It’s for my pa and ma. 
If I can get famous, folks’ll pay to visit my ranch... 
From sundown, I live by candlelight until I go to sleep.
That’s not to say I don’t have electric power on the homestead. 
Candlelight can be very romantic. 
I’d like to introduce you to my cherished partners.
Good, good. Good going, gang. You guys all did great. 
Wheeze... Wheeze... I’m feeling faint... 
I’m no green thumb at growing Berries. Raising Pokémon is where I shine.
I can give you tips on raising Pokémon so they’ll grow tough. 
Raising a living thing is never an easy job... 
Pokémon are Pokémon, no matter how tough, weak, cute, or scary.
Raise Pokémon with love, and they’ll return it. 
I think it’s the Trainer who needs to pick up the pace here. 
Raising a Pokémon right takes money and time.
But it’s all worthwhile when the Pokémon grows up. 
To raise the ideal Pokémon, I’m willing to work hard. 
That’s right, I’m tough. I won’t lose. I don’t think losing’s possible.
Yup, I’m so tough... Ehehe... Heeheehee... 
I lost? But, how...? What now? What do I do? 
I’m an Ace Trainer, so this is for bragging rights.
Yup, you did good. No, seriously. 
Heh... I’ve got a long ways to go... 
I was looking forward to a battle with you!
I was right! You are pretty decent. Why not become an Ace Trainer? 
You’re as good as the rumors say... May I have a rematch one day? 
Look at me. I’m what you should be aspiring to be.
You expected anything else? 
You’ve already surpassed me. But you can aim so much higher. 
My whole life hinges on this one battle! ...Lose for me, pretty please?
Yeah! I won! It’s all smooth sailing for me now! 
I wasn’t supposed to lose... That’s my life derailed... 
I’m running a fever here. Just so’s you know.
Oogh, my head’s burning up. It makes me feel more inspired. 
Like I said, I have a cold. I’m not on top of my game. 
When we battle, I want you to be very careful. My coat’s very expensive.
Yikes! Eek! Watch out! You almost got Pokémon sweat on my coat! 
I was worried about getting my coat dirty. Who cares about your battle? 
I wish you’d leave. I don’t want to see you lose.
I told you so... Can you leave, please? 
Listen...is being tough not always a good thing? 
Whoa-whoa-whoa... Careful now! Maintaining balance is the key!
Whoops...! Almost went over! Have to be careful here... 
...Waaaaaah... Thud! 
Now don’t you worry about a thing. You leave everything to me, OK?
What do you say? Fun, hey? It’d be nice if we could meet again. 
Well, I’ll be! You sure got the best of me! 
I will battle. It’s not likely I will lose. I’m tough.
I win. I could do a dance right now. 
What is the matter? Why couldn’t I win? 
Mother Nature, I beseech you! Please, lend me strength!
Oh, Mother Nature, I thank you! To you, I dedicate this victory! 
I’m sorry, Mother Nature! I’m sorry to disappoint you! 
A good Trainer takes on all challenges regardless of the foe or the rules.
No Trainer can be considered bad if they battle the best they can. 
A good Trainer doesn’t gloat over a win. They just prepare for the next battle. 
Come hither, my Pokémon! Please get rid of this mean Trainer!
Ooh, yes, I love you, my sweeties! Come here and give me a kiss!
How could you?! You hurt my sweet little ones! 
I’m fine with practice and training, but I wilt when the chips are down.
I feel sick from tension! I’d rather be at home practicing! 
If it’s about practice, I’d be the champ without a doubt. 
Hi-yah! Hah! Hah! One more! Hah! Hah!
Boo-yah! 
Hi-yah! ...No, wait! No! 
Wanna?
Heh... 
You beat me? Where’s your dojo? 
Come oooon! C’mon, c’mon! Hey! Hey! C’mon, hey!
Oh, yesssss! 
Oh, noooooo! 
Your eyes are unclouded by doubt. This match will be entertaining...
From my heart, I look forward to your return. 
Whew... A most entertaining match. I hope you’ll grant me a rematch. 
You need to be taught what wisdom of age means in battle!
I’ll have you know that no child can hope to defeat me! 
That did not happen! Unfair! I demand a rematch right now! 
I’m feeling cranky today! Help me get my mind off it!
Whew... A battle is the perfect stress reliever! 
Eeeeeeeeh! You’ve pushed me over to furious! 
Cue battle music, please! I want to trumpet my victory!
I love the battle music. It sets my heart racing. 
Fine, that will do. Back to the regular theme music. 
When you’ve been a Trainer as long as I have, let’s just say you’ll see a lot.
Things like this happen. Don’t let it get you down. 
People and Pokémon are all different. Isn’t that what makes it beautiful?
My big brother told me to go for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!
I did it, big brother! 
My big brother told me to wreck the other Trainer’s accuracy! 
I hear my Pokémon calling out... They clamor to battle...
I hear my Pokémon calling out... They call for your return... 
I hear my Pokémon calling out... They tell me of the fun they had... 
Behind you, I see light. What is its significance?
I thought I saw an aura of invincibility. I must have been mistaken. 
Now I see... You glow with the light of victory... 
I’ll deliver defeat to you elegantly and speedily.
Thank you for your patience! 
I’m so terribly sorry. I ended up with your intended defeat. 
Great, another tough-looking Trainer. The fun never ends for me.
Bleah, that was too close for comfort. Nothing ever comes easy for me. 
Yeah, see? I knew I’d lose. If only that move landed... 
Everyone has too much to say about Pokémon! If it’s fun, that’s enough!
Excuse me, but are you all right? Maybe you’re a little too tired? 
If you get too caught up in winning and losing, you’ll burn yourself out. 
Aren’t you the cutest guest! You can expect the best service from me!
Well, were you impressed by the level of service I provided? 
Oh, wait, please! I’m not done serving you! 
I keep a journal about the lives of the Trainers who arrive here.
In our vast world, I wonder how many Trainers will cross my path? 
Every encounter ends in parting. That’s why I keep a journal. 
I’ve waited all my life for someone like you. I’m never letting you go.
It was a ploy to confuse you with words out of some romance movie. 
Now, go on, don’t let me hold you back. Seize your chance at happiness! 
Will you give me an interview if you win?
You made my job too easy. You need to buckle down. 
Your feelings now, in a word! Shout it into the mike, please! 
I’m on a diet... I’m so famished...
I’m happy, but if I get excited, I’ll get hungry. No thanks... 
Oh... Your Pokémon look delicious... 
Let me make it clear right now, I’m tougher than you can stand!
See? I wasn’t exaggerating! 
Who are you exactly?! 
Clear the way! Out of the way! Wait! Don’t go! We have to battle!
Come on, take it up a gear! Keep up with me! 
OK, out of the way! Clear the way! Let this loser run away! 
Safe driving and safer battling. That’s my motto.
You can be patient in a battle. Victory will come eventually. 
I’ll keep to my own pace. I’ll catch up to you one day. 
I only have this bike to look good for the ladies. I can’t actually ride.
It was a pain getting this bike here. I had to push it all the way! 
I’m only concerned about looking good. I don’t practice enough. 
I’m not looking for any excitement. I don’t need any drama.
A battle is all the excitement I need. 
I recently realized that I’m not cut out for this scary job. 
I’ll battle my way. You battle yours.
People are people. I’ll go my own way. 
People are people. You go your own way. 
Today, I have a special treat for all my fans!
Thank you! I love your support! 
Are you really one of my fans? 
I’m burnt out on being an Idol. I want to go home to the country...
I can’t quit now! Kids dream of being me! 
I miss hearing my mother’s voice... 
I’m one of a kind. That’s what I’m saying.
I keep it real. That’s what makes me tough. 
I kept it real, but you won anyway. Your reality was more real. 
Hi! Are you my next opponent? Let’s keep it clean and fair!
It feels great going all out with no dirty tricks. 
That was an awesome workout! We have to do this again sometime! 
My needs are simple. Fishing and Moomoo Milk are all I need.
Winning or losing isn’t something I pay heed to. 
I could use some Moomoo Milk right about now. 
You there! Take a look at the Pokémon I fished up the other day.
I can tell you’re impressed. This guy, I don’t know how long it took to land. 
A word of advice: when an older person is bragging, pretend to be interested. 
You’re a Trainer. Let your Pokémon do the talking.
Where’s your spirit? That didn’t speak to me at all. 
Great! Great! Your feelings came across! 
Here comes your prey! Get ’em! Chaaaarge!
Gaahahaha! That’s it! Good job! 
We’re outmatched! Pull back, guys! Run away! 
Bring it on! Ooooh! Haaah!
Thank you kindly! 
Thanks for having me! 
I am captivated by the mountains. They’re the main thing in my life!
The mountains mean more to me than any battle, no matter how fun! 
Your battle skills are impressive, but I can’t wait to return to the mountains. 
We’re going to hammer you, kid. Don’t freeze up and close your eyes.
I like how you stay defiant even after losing. Good attitude, kid. 
Honest, I didn’t let up one bit or let down my guard because you’re a kid. 
I battle around the globe. I’m a worldwide bad boy!
I don’t lose at battling. I can’t get over how cool I am! 
I’m hitting the road over that loss. It’s good-bye to the old me! 
Battles, I’m good at. But musical aptitude? Forget it.
This whole battling thing is good, but I wish I could play music as well. 
Music or Pokémon... It’s a tough choice. 
I wrote a song using the cries of Pokémon. I’d like you to hear it.
Graaah wagyaaah! Wagyaaaah! Chu! Chu! Gyaroooh-gah! 
Giiyaaaah! Drundundun! Garoo-gah! Wawawaaah! 
I’m bored of collecting and hoarding. I’m getting rid of everything now.
There’s nothing that I really want now. Maybe I’ll become a clown...
I threw the match for a start. It’s nice to be unburdened of things.
Oh! Hold on a second! Incoming text message!
Ticka-ticka-ticka... Ticka-tick... Huh? Is it over already? 
Hey, stop that! No peeking at my text messages! 
There’s no meaning to this battle! Pokémon should be about love!
Battling leaves me empty. Hug your Pokémon and show your love! 
Battling creates nothing. Hug your Pokémon and show your love! 
Are you challenging me? ...You are. Kids these days...
Now run along home, and go help your mommy with her chores! 
Hey, you... If you think playtime will last forever, you’ll end up like me. 
How will you counter my implacable logic?
Everything according to calculation... This victory is a complete one. 
You outcalculated me. I’m incredulous. 
I’ve been ensconced in the lab. My shoulders are all knotted up.
What a refreshing break! I’m feeling loose and relaxed now. 
My Pokémon and I, we all need to get outside and exercise more. 
Hmmm... So young... I may have to go easy...
You’re so depressingly young... It’s fine. You may go. 
Consider the loser’s feelings. That’s where you young people fail... 
You see an old man, yes? Don’t be fooled by the way I look.
I find it abhorrent to lose to any young Trainer. 
I was fooled by your youth. Foolish, foolish me... 
As a Worker, it’s my job to both build and demolish.
Why don’t you become a Worker, too? I find it fun and rewarding. 
Making things is harder than demolishing, but it’s more satisfying. 
You and your Pokémon, I’ll clean up on you easily.
Well, well, how pathetic was that. Take your passengers and go home. 
Gwaah... So heavy... My guys buckled under the load. 
Outstanding athleticism and a great sense of humor; that’s a clown!
A clown is a job of greatness. Only the chosen can become one! 
The ability to laugh off disappointment is another requirement for a clown! 
Laugh with the face and cry with the heart; that’s how a clown lives.
Ahahahahaha! 
Gah! ...Ahahahaha! 
Oi, listen! I’m a Policeman, sure, but a Trainer before that!
What? A Policeman can’t lose his temper? 
Yes, I’m a Policeman, but I have dreams and aspirations, and, and... Snivel... 
Hands up! Put ’em where I can see ’em! You’re all under arrest!
Case closed! 
This is a gross miscarriage of justice! 
I’ll have you know that I’m an Internet detective.
My powers of observation and logic prevailed! 
Think you’ve outsmarted me? Maybe this was just a sting operation! 
Wherever, whenever, and with whomever. That’s my motto!
When, where, or whom... It doesn’t matter at all to me. 
Hahaha! This is great! I want to keep this going! 
The loser has to pretend to be a STUNKY, OK?
Giggle, you lose. I want to see your STUNKY impression! 
OK, here’s my STUNKY impression! Three, two, one... 
A good breeze has sprung up... This is good! I can win this!
The tailwind put us over the top! ...As they say! 
The headwind worked against us! ...As they say! 
Even though I always have my parasol up, I actually like sunny days.
I hope it will be sunny tomorrow... 
The heavy downpour in my heart... When will it ever stop...? 
My, you’re very eager to go. I’d better take the tension up a notch, too!
I had a lot of fun with that match! Wouldn’t it be nice to see you again! 
You’re so full of energy! Why, I feel energized, too! 
How much longer do I have to wait for a Trainer that’s any good?
I’m so bored by the weak competition. Maybe I’ll just retire. 
Oh, hello, there. Now, you’re a little special. 
My ladylike charms don’t mean a thing to a little kid...
That was too close for comfort! It doesn’t pay to underestimate foes. 
Battling fair and square doesn’t appeal to me. I’d rather win. 
Like everything else, people have likes and dislikes when it comes to scents.
I love how Pokémon smell after a battle. 
I feel a little thrill if I catch a whiff of intense effort postbattle. 
Sniff, sniff... Yes! Here it comes! Aroma power!
With aroma power, I’m invincible! 
Fizzle... I’m out of aroma power... 
Turn, step, turn, turn... I’ll practice my dance steps while battling!
I dance with passion and precision. How can there be a weakness? 
You’re throwing off my rhythm! My dance routine is ruined! 
I’m always ready for the public eye. You can come at me at your own pace.
That’s why people consider me the perfect Idol. 
I didn’t know how bad it feels to lose. This is a first for me. 
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic! Do come again! 
I have no problem with losing to a spectacular Trainer like you! 
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic! Do come again! 
I have no problem with losing to a spectacular Trainer like you! 
What Pokémon do you want up on stage? I can’t wait!
That was a most enjoyable time! Thank you! Come again, please. 
Oh... I detest how fun times seem to end so quickly. 
What Pokémon do you want to show off this time? I can’t wait!
How wonderful that was! Thank you! Come again, please. 
It’s so sad how the truly fun times seem to last only a moment. 
It doesn’t matter what you throw at me. I’ll always win. My investigative and analytical system is truly amazing.
See? Just as analyzed. 
Whoa! You sure showed me! 
It doesn’t matter what you throw at me. I’ll always win. I’ll stake my investigative and analytical system on it!
See? Just as analyzed. 
Whoa! You sure showed me! 
Always be smiling! Luck comes to those who are happy! That’s why I always keep a big smile and believe in my Pokémon when I battle.
You’re very good! I had a lot of fun! 
You’re so very, very good! My Pokémon had a good time, too! 
Whenever I battle someone tough, I smile. I cannot help it! How about you? What do you do? Do you laugh? Cry? Get angry?
Win or lose, whenever I battle someone wonderful, I am happy! 
Battling a wonderful Trainer is always a happy occasion! 
Very well... Shall we begin?
Ah, a most valiant effort. Though I was lucky enough to win this time, the next time... 
My Pokémon could not be faulted in any way or form. My hat’s off to you. 
This is for Lady Caitlin’s sake. I’m afraid I must go all out.
Ah, a most valiant effort. Though I was lucky enough to win this time, the next time... 
Your skills are superlative as ever! My admiration knows no bounds.

Forget it! This isn’t over yet! 
My Pokémon’s getting low on HP... Things could be tight here. 
What’s going on here? What, I lost?! 
Think you can take down the  next Pokémon like you did earlier? 
No way! Not yet! Not giving up! 
W-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon! 
You avoided the long way around? Let’s see why you’d do that! 
Now I understand why you decided to battle with me. 
You should go whichever way you want, shortcut or the long way! 
Only those who want to win can challenge a Pokémon Gym! 
Gggh... This is humiliating! 
One day, I’m going to become a tough Trainer like you. 
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, and so am I! Our eyes met, so battle we must! 
Too strong! Too strong!
Don’t be shy about talking to Trainers you’d like to battle. Pokémon grow stronger and stronger from battling.
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here, just look! 
Let’s have a Pokémon battle! Humph! But I’m gonna win! 
You beat me?! You’ve got talent!
It was fun battling! Yup! I’m going to battle everyone!
Let’s have another Pokémon battle! This time, I’m gonna win! 
I spy, with my little eye... A Trainer! A battle, please! 
Oh, boo! I can’t win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out! I need to go to a Pokémon Center!
Oh, hi! I remember you, Trainer! A battle, please! 
I get my get-up-and-go from my Pokémon! Here we go! KRICKETOT! ZUBAT! 
Ack! My Pokémon...
Keep out of the grass or dodge the eyes of Trainers...? I always have a tough time choosing. 
Hey, I remember your face, Trainer. You’ll battle me again, won’t you? 
I’m never apart from my SHINX. Our bond is strong! 
So sad... And so crushed... 
I don’t bear grudges over losing. But I promise I’ll get tougher! 
I’m always with my Pokémon. Actually, you’re always with your Pokémon too, aren’t you? 
Before I challenge the Pokémon Gym Leader, I’ll test my strength on you! 
I guess it means I’m not ready for the Gym challenge yet... 
I guess if you don’t have a single Gym Badge, you’re a total nobody... 
I’m about ready to challenge the Pokémon Gym Leader. But before I do, let me test my strength on you again! 
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City! 
Oh, I lost! Lalala! 
I’m collecting lots of Gym Badges. They’re so sparkly and pretty! 
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City! ...Did I show you already? 
I found a Trainer while looking for some Pokémon! 
Hunh? You’re finished so soon? 
I walk through tall grass until I find the Pokémon I want. 
I found a familiar-looking Trainer! 
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer... Do you want to have a go? 
Aww... I should have said no. 
Oh, you’re so mean! I just started training Pokémon! 
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer! Will you give me a rematch? 
I’ll beat you with the MAGIKARP my dad gave me! 
But they’re Pokémon I got from my dad... 
Who gave you your first Pokémon? Your first Pokémon is the one with the most fond memories, I think. 
This time, I’ll beat you with the Pokémon my dad gave me! 
May I please trouble you for a battle? 
Oh... You’re so strong... 
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon was holding a Berry... 
Excuse me, may I please trouble you to have one more battle? 
Hey, hey, let me show off my bug Pokémon! 
I’m not going to be able to explain the charms of bug Pokémon this way! 
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do stuff like poison and paralyze, and they’re cute and yet cool. You gotta believe me. They’re good! 
So, listen. Tell me you’ve grown to like bug Pokémon since we last met? 
What kind of person are you, to be drawn here by the scent of flowers? 
It was a strong Trainer who was drawn here by the scent of flowers! 
By the way, have you collected new apps from the Pokétch Company? 
You came back to me because you couldn’t forget the smell of flowers! 
Liv: We can one-shot this Trainer, can’t we, Liz? 
Liv: Oh, oh, oh? 
Liv: This Trainer...will brag about beating us, Liz. 
Liv: You only have one Pokémon? That’s so boring!
Liv: Oh! You’re that Trainer! Let’s get payback, Liz! 
Liz: We’re the strongest in our class! 
Liz: Oh, but, wait! 
Liz: This Trainer...is really happy about beating us, Liv. 
Liz: Um, will you battle with us? Me and Liv? 
Liz: We’re the best in our class. We can’t be losers all the time! 
Hey, how about you and me battle before I go into Eterna Forest? 
That really dampened my spirits. 
I heard that really tough Pokémon appear in Eterna Forest. I need to be more prepared than this! 
You’ve been to Eterna Forest already, right? How was it? 
It’s a long way between Floaroma and Eterna City. So, let’s battle! 
Wawawaah! I’m out of Pokémon that can go! 
Camping with Pokémon! Do you have any idea how fun that is? 
While I was enjoying camping, my Pokémon got all buffed up! 
What kinds of Pokémon live around here, I wonder? 
I’m shocked! How did I lose? 
I know all sorts of things about Pokémon! Let’s see... There are males and females, and some aren’t either! 
Oh, hi! We meet again! Have you seen any rare Pokémon? 
Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little? 
Oh, boo! How insulting! 
Listen very closely... Can you hear the cries of Pokémon? 
Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little again? 
There’s no mountain here, but I’m dressed to hike! Gahaha! Here goes! 
Oh, yeah! A refreshing battle that was! 
You can find the same kinds of Pokémon in all sorts of places. There’s no law saying a Hiker can’t go searching off in the mountains! 
If you meet someone in the mountains, they’re no longer strangers. Meet them twice, and they’re your friend! 
I’ve lost my way... Here of all places... 
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost the battle too... 
From being lost in the mountains so long, I became a Hiker... 
I’ve lost my way again... Yes, it’s me again with no sense of direction... 
Hiyah! There’s no holding anything back! 
I... I concede! I think you’re on a different level... 
Hiyah! You put me in my place! I appreciate it! 
Hiyah! This time, there really is no holding anything back! 
I love Pokémon that smell sweet. Like this one--get a whiff of this! 
Did you understand what I meant? Didn’t my Pokémon smell nice? 
If you plant lots of Berries, you can be surrounded by sweet scents. 
Sniff... Oh? Your Pokémon smells nice! 
Nothing’s biting... I could use a break, I suppose. 
Well, that didn’t do anything for me... 
! Yank your fishing rod when that appears. That’s how you fish. 
All right! I caught some tough Pokémon. I’m ready for battle! 
How about that! I’ve netted me a feisty Trainer! 
I let a big win slip away... 
Do you have a fishing rod? Catch some big ones! 
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught a big one! Let’s battle again! 
I fished up some tough Pokémon! Let’s have ourselves a battle! 
Losing to a kid has me gasping like a MAGIKARP... 
My feet are tangled, too! Ouch! Ouch! 
I’m going to win this time! I said I’ll win, and I mean it! 
Yo! Cycling and Pokémon! Which do you prefer? 
Hey, not bad, you! 
This Cycling Road is one fine place-- great bikes, superb Pokémon, and awesome Trainers all around! 
I’m sure I’ve seen your face before. Did we maybe battle? 
Ding-ding! Watch out, you! Or, did you want to battle? 
Despite all the effort, I’m just spinning my wheels... It’s always that way with me! 
I might try racing through Cycling Road in one long shot. 
There you are! I’ve been riding in this spot so I’d get a rematch with you! 
That Bike you’ve got there...it’s the type that can change gears! You gotta love that! Sure, I’ll give you a battle! 
Crash! Tinkle... 
The 3-speed makes for easy turning, and the 4-speed’s for going fast. I love them both! 
Is your bicycle geared to 3-speed now? Or do you have it set to 4-speed? 
A bike will carry you a long way. The only thing that limits you is your own endurance! 
Gasp... Gasp... Gasp... 
My Pokémon and I are plumb worn out. We should be getting home to rest... 
We took a recuperative rest. We’re not losing this time! 
Cycling feels great! It will feel even better when I beat you in a battle! 
Whew! You worked us over. 
I like spinning the pedals backward while sailing downhill. 
It feels great on my Bike! I’m already sweaty, so let’s have a rematch! 
The both of us are on Bikes, and we both have Pokémon! I can’t let you get the better of me! 
Oh, geez... I seem to have fallen off my Bike.
I should have challenged you to a race, not a battle! 
I hate knowing you’ve beaten me. This time, I’m going to win! 
If you beat me, you can count on something rotten coming your way! 
Kerrrash!
Aww! Why did you beat me?! I hope you get so lost in Wayward Cave you cry! Boo-hoo-hoo! 
I had to get my revenge on you. I trained my Pokémon while wandering lost in Wayward Cave! 
Some people compete over speed, and some compete over technique. Which kind are you? 
You’re a speedy technician! 
I enjoy the scenery. Don’t you think the area below Cycling Road looks nice? 
I polished up both my speed and techniques. Can you beat me now? 
Whoa! You startled me! Well, we may as well battle! 
Your power startles me! 
We Hikers are bighearted guys! Losing doesn’t bother us! 
Whoa! You startled me! We may as well have a rematch! 
I wear shorts the whole year! I’ve got energy to burn! 
I couldn’t win with just energy... Nothing’s really that easy! 
Pokémon don’t wear clothes. I worry about them getting cold. 
I wear shorts! I have lots of energy! I’m not losing to you! 
Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do my best, too! 
Oh... We lost... 
Dig for Fossils in the Underground. The mining museum might be able to bring back the ancient Pokémon! 
Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do more than my best this time! 
Go do it, my Pokémon! I’ll work hard, too! 
Oh... We lost...
I think we’ll visit the TV station in Jubilife City next. Or maybe we should go to the Global Terminal? 
Umm, aren’t you that Trainer who beat us before? We feel good today, so we’ll be happy to face you again! 
Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune! 
Wahahaha! There’s nothing that I can do but laugh! 
Wahahahaha! ...Go ahead, laugh at me--the loser! 
Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune! Forgetting your gloves brings a cold! 
I just got through Mt. Coronet, but I’ve still got energy to burn! 
Whoops! Taken down easily! 
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City before heading to Mt. Coronet again. 
I just got through Mt. Coronet, and who do I see? A Trainer who we’ve battled before! 
OK, OK! Let’s be quick about this! 
Oh, yeah? Let’s do this again! ...Oops. I’m out of Pokémon! 
Yup! Good going! I like the way you battle! 
What took you so long? We’ve waited here a long time for a rematch with you! 
Gahahaha! You’re just a little kid! How’re you supposed to beat a big man like me? 
Oh my, a big man like me got schooled by a little kid like you! 
Wow, you’re sure impressive! I guess it makes no difference if you’re young or old in battles. 
Hey, you, tough little kid! Throw us a rematch, will you? 
They call me the Echo Man! Battle with me! Yahoo! 
Ohh... Yo... Yodelay... 
Here’s good advice from the Echo Man! If you’re at a loss as to where you should be going, check the Town Map! 
Oh, hi there! Remember us? I’m the Echo Man! Let’s have another battle! Yahoo! 
If I beat you, will you share some food with me? 
We were starved for food, and now we’re starved for a win... 
Sigh... I feel even hungrier... Maybe I’ll chow down some Berries... But that’s kind of gross. What am I, a Pokémon? 
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch before we started climbing. If I beat you this time, share some food with me! 
This karate man’s going to pulverize you! 
We got pulverized... 
It’s obvious I need to train myself and my Pokémon harder. Hey, if you’ve got a Vs. Seeker, you’d better put it to good use. Nothing beats some repeated battling for toughening up your Pokémon. 
This karate man hasn’t forgotten being pulverized by you! 
Muhihi... I’ll haul you up and out! 
Restraint is my favorite word. Like...from crushing my opponents. 
You need a Good Rod if you want to catch good Pokémon. 
Muhihi... There won’t be any restraint this time, OK? 
Oh, you want to have a battle? I was meaning to enter a Contest, but beating you won’t take long... 
Oh, you have us beaten. 
You and your Pokémon have so much energy. I think you would do well in Contests, too. 
Oh, didn’t we meet before? I was meaning to enter a Contest, but let’s have a quick battle first. 
You and I! Let us create a scene! A fantastic tableau of battle! 
Magnificent! I am aglow with inspiration! 
That battle will surely become a stupendous masterpiece painting! I shall title it... “My Pokémon Is Fight”! 
The key to becoming a good painter is to be observant. That is the same for battling. One must be observant! 
Let me see how much you’ve raised your Pokémon. 
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in impeccable condition. 
It’s obvious you raise your Pokémon with a lot of love. 
I’ve raised my Pokémon since we met. How much have you raised yours? 
Please, let me battle the Pokémon you’ve raised! 
Giggle... They’re raised with a lot of care! 
Raise your Pokémon with lots of love, and they’ll bond closely with you. 
You’re that Trainer who treats Pokémon with a lot of love! Please, let me battle the Pokémon you’ve raised again! 
Say, honey, where’d you come from? What kinds of Pokémon are you with? 
Fancy folks like you have fancy Pokémon too, it looks like. 
While working the ranch, I get to raise my Pokémon, too. I’d say it’s the best of both worlds! 
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again? What kinds of Pokémon’d you bring? 
I jog every morning to keep my Pokémon fit. 
Oops! You threw off my running rhythm. 
Nothing beats being fit and healthy! Come on, won’t you run with me? To a better tomorrow! 
Do you jog every morning, too? 
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots of people. I have trouble remembering faces, but we did meet before, right? 
                      
                            
                           
                   
                         
                                      
               
              
                        
Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon! 
So sad... So bitter... 
I don’t want to be a Trainer. I want to be a Pokémon! 
Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon! ...You knew that, didn’t you? 
                       
           
                        
Ty: You’re not supposed to intrude on my time with Sue! 
Ty: I only have eyes for Sue. Maybe that’s why we lost? 
Ty: Sue, even in defeat, you’re so beautiful...! 
Ty: I don’t want to do anything without Sue... Bring two Pokémon at least, OK? 
Ty: Did you come back to intrude on my time with Sue? 
Sue: Huh? You want to battle with me? I will if I can team with Ty! 
Sue: I’m sorry, Ty! 
Sue: We lost... Ty, I need a hug to make it all better! 
Sue: I only want to battle next to my sweet Ty. Don’t you have two Pokémon? 
Sue: Oh, it’s you again! I’ll battle if I can team with Ty! 
                      
                   
                                 
                                               
                                
                       
                                               
                                                      
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about rhythm, too! 
It’s a goal of sorts, I’d say! 
If I get out of rhythm, I can’t get my act together. 
When I was jogging the other day, a wild Pokémon came after me. I ran so fast, I was on top of the waves, I swear!
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about rhythm, too. Our rematch is also about rhythm! 
Emma: We’re tough because we battle together! 
Emma: Waaah! 
Emma: That was awesome! Are you maybe a Pokémon genius? You’re well deserving of respect! 
We won’t talk to people who have only one Pokémon! 
Emma: When I battle with Lil, we shouldn’t lose! 
Lil: We’re gonna crunch and munch you all up! 
Lil: Hwaaah! 
Lil: We’re going to be super-strong Trainers like you! I just decided now! Please cheer for us! 
We don’t talk to people who have only one Pokémon! 
Lil: You munched us all up last time, but it’s our turn now! 
Hey, check this out! Look at the luster of my Pokémon’s fur! 
Hey, hey, did you take a good look? 
The Veilstone Department Store is pretty impressive! Did you know they even sell Poffins? 
I brushed my party a lot. So we’d be ready for a rematch! 
I’m a rookie breeder, but I’ll do my very best! 
It’s all right! I’m still a rookie! 
The best way to raise Pokémon? ...Hmm, when it comes right down to it, isn’t it all about love? 
I can’t be a rookie forever. I’ve learned a lot since we last met. 
                             
           
                                                       
                      
                
                         
                                               
                           
                                
                               
                              
                          
                            
                           
          
                               
                           
        
                                
                                
                
                              
Teri: Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of Pokémon! 
Teri: We tried really hard together, but we lost anyway. 
Teri: Our mommy is a twin, too. 
Teri: We want to battle with lots of Pokémon. 
Teri: Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of Pokémon again! 
Tia: Yay! We’re all going to battle! 
Tia: We tried really hard together, but we couldn’t win anyway. 
Tia: When Mommy and Aunty and me and Teri get together, it’s really confusing and fun! 
Tia: Um, no. We all want to battle together. 
Tia: Yay! We’re all going to battle again! 
My Pokémon toughened up while working on the ranch. I’m right proud of them! 
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be counted on! 
When I cuddle with my Pokémon, I can feel not just their bodies’ warmth, but their compassion. 
Whoa! You’re that real-tough Trainer from before! Here are my ranch-toughened Pokémon! I’m right proud of them! 
I’m warmed up and limber. I’m OK to battle! 
...Oh, serious woe. I wasn’t prepared emotionally for this. 
I wish I could just run from all this... Just joking. 
I’m going to keep running. Just as long as there’s a road... 
I’ve been training so I can have a rematch with you. I’m OK to battle! 
Matt: Uhohoho! I’ll show y’all how tightly I’ve bonded with my daughter! 
Matt: Parent-and-child power couldn’t get the job done. 
Matt: I reckon the bonds between you and your Pokémon are like the bonds parents share with their kids. 
Matt: Oh, there’s no way you could beat us both with one Pokémon. 
Matt: Ayuh? You’re here to check the bond I have with my daughter again? 
Ava: I can get away with slacking off if I have my Pokémon out! 
Ava: Oh, sheesh! 
Ava: Papa, I’m so sorry! I’ll work harder from tomorrow on! ...Yup, tomorrow’s when I’m going to start working. 
Ava: You’re battling me and my pa. One Pokémon won’t cut it, dear! 
Ava: Oh, hi! It’s good y’all came calling on us again! I can take a break from work if I’m battling Pokémon. Lucky for me! 
I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I concede defeat... 
My cover is blown, so what should I do? Maybe I’ll go catch some Contests in Hearthome City. Maybe I’ll do that. 
Do you remember me? I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I concede defeat... 
While I hid in the tall grass, I sensed Pokémon all around me! Furtive sounds of movement... Stifled cries... I heard them! 
You don’t remember me? I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! But how did you discover me? Don’t tell me you’re a ninja, too! 
I concede defeat... 
A Pokémon Trainer’s good at finding stuff, I guess. 
You should join us so we can form the Ninja Quartet! Anyway, let’s battle! 
You seem to have a lot of confidence. Let’s see if it’s justified! 
Haha! A total loss for me! 
You seem to have an abundance of talent. It’s pretty amazing. 
When I lost to you last time, I was just unlucky. 
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take battles in stride. I need to stay cool and calm whether I win or lose. 
Aiyeeeeh! We lost! 
How dare you beat us! Go away! Go! 
Last time, I got a little emotional over losing... I’ll stay cool and calm today! 
Very well. I’ve decided. I’ll battle one last time, with you, then I’m retiring as a Trainer. 
I’ve lost, but... What is this rush I feel?! 
Yes! This is fun! Pokémon are fun! Retire? Perish that thought! I’ll become a lot tougher. Next time, victory is mine! 
Your young power against my veteran technique... Let us battle again to see who wins this time! 
This buff physique isn’t just for show! 
B-but! My buff physique!
Why? Is it because my training isn’t enough?! 
My buff physique! Feast your eyes on it again! 
I just startled you! While you’re still struggling to recover, I’ll already be the winner! 
Oh, what’s that? You’re supposed to be fumbling more. 
I wanted a better reaction from you. Now I feel silly for hiding! 
You just saw me, and I bet you thought, “Long time no see.” While you’re still thinking that, I’ll already be the winner! 
We ninjas appear where you least expect us! 
I didn’t expect to lose... 
While hiding, I think about what Pokémon must be thinking inside their Poké Balls. 
Wah! Another chance encounter with a foe who defeated me before! 
A ninja can use all kinds of skills. Like this and like that! 
Hmm... My ninja techniques failed to work... 
There’s a ninja Gym Leader somewhere far away. I should become a devotee of theirs. 
What’s with you? You’re not a ninja yet? 
Try not to be shocked when you lay your eyes on my Pokémon! 
Oh, my... Good golly ’n’ gosh... 
A dragon Pokémon’s real power is nothing like mine! 
You again? You must really like that dragon Pokémon I use. 
I’ll teach you about the charms of bird Pokémon! 
Well, that was surprising! 
The sight of you battling... It was simply a wonder to watch! 
Are you finally noticing the great qualities of bird Pokémon? 
Zac: Jen, watch this! I’m going to use everything you’ve taught me! 
Zac: Wow. Someone that’s even better than Jen... 
Zac: I don’t care if I get to meet the greatest Trainer in the region... I’d still rather learn from Jen. 
Zac: Would you be interested in battling the two of us at the same time? What I mean is, do you have two or more Pokémon with you? 
Zac: This time, I’m not gonna let you down, Jen! I promise! 
Jen: Here comes a Trainer. Zac, you ready? Let’s do this! 
Jen: I just got embarrassed in front of my little buddy here... 
Jen: Zac, I’m so sorry. I’m a failure as your instructor. 
Jen: Would you like to have a two-on-two Pokémon battle with us? 
Jen: Here comes our Trainer! Are you ready this time? 
Look at these beautiful wings! 
Oh, you! I’m going to peck you for that! 
There’s a bird Pokémon that can learn human speech! Did you know that? 
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous wings. It must have been some sort of a mistake that we lost last time! 
                 
                  
              
ZUBAT! Doesn’t that sound like a ninja bursting from cover? 
Oh! My ZUBAT tristars... 
Sowing confusion among the foe is one way a ninja battles. A Pokémon can’t overcome its confusion unless it switches out. 
The shinobi live by speed! I’ll get in my attacks before you do! 
See how Mt. Coronet towers above us. I want to be big like that one day! 
You loom before me as a giant presence! 
Mt. Coronet has long been known as an ancient and mysterious mountain. 
Hmm?!  You loom before me again?! You’re like Mt. Coronet that way! 
Hah! Hah! I’m psyched for this! Here goes! 
I don’t get why we can’t win. 
I don’t reminisce over yesterday. I don’t think about tomorrow. I only live today to the fullest. That’s my policy! 
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! This time, I’m properly psyched! 
Speed is a ninja’s best weapon! Can you keep up? 
I did a lot to conceal myself, too... 
I’ll wait here for a weaker-looking Trainer and then ambush them! 
I became even faster! How can you hope to keep up? 
I go everywhere with my NOCTOWL. We’re gonna show you owl best! Ha! 
We did our best. That’s what matters. Right? 
Even on cold days, just being with my NOCTOWL keeps me warm! 
I curled up inside my NOCTOWL’s wings and waited for you to return! 
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted a Trainer! I must investigate! 
My investigation has revealed the Trainer to be tough! Ouch... 
Celestic Town is an old town. I’m sure to find something cool. 
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted you again! I will now investigate! 
My Pokémon sleeps in a bed I got from overseas. I’m very well off, if you haven’t noticed! 
What? Over already? Well, that’s fine. Rich people like me don’t fight. 
Oh, no. My Pokémon is worn out. I’d better let it sleep it off in the bed I had sent from overseas. 
I do this only because I love my Pokémon. Winning isn’t that important. 
I’d like to begin now. Are you quite prepared? 
Oh! How terrible of you... 
You... You must have one fantastic teacher to be so good. 
We meet again. Are you quite prepared? 
If it pleases you, may I challenge you to a battle? 
Bravo! Your technique is impeccable for someone so young. 
Hahaha! I was invited by the master of the Pokémon Mansion. He’s promised to show me through his prized garden of Pokémon. 
If it pleases you, would you care for a rematch with me? 
I’ve never battled a young Trainer like yourself. It’s quite nerve wracking. 
Oh, dear... That wasn’t anything like battling with my friends. 
Usually, I’ll have matches with members of my social club. 
Oh, it’s you again, dear? It makes me a little nervous to ask, but may I have a rematch? 
                          
                 
                                                      
Hold it right there, citizen! Walking around at night is unsafe! 
You’ve got tough partners with you. Carry on, citizen. Carry on. 
Out so late? Does your mother know you’re out so late? 
Well, hello there! That’s very civil minded of you to say hello to your local Policeman! 
Didn’t I already give you a warning? It’s unsafe to walk around at night! 
I’m keeping my eyes open for crime. Anyone arousing suspicion here? 
Now, just hold on. I didn’t say that you were shady looking! 
Don’t go hanging out with any shady-looking characters! You hear? 
Patrolling night and day sure is exhausting... Yawn... 
Any shady-looking characters around? I’m always on the lookout for punks. Expecting some shady dude to actually pop up... Does that make me weird? 
Let’s enjoy a fierce battle in the chilly night winds! Brrrr! Refreshing! 
I need to explain, all right? It was too dark and hard to see. 
Oops, I’d better get back to my beat before the boss radios me... 
Yo! Hanging tough, Trainer? Word! I’m trying to make my lingo more hip! 
Still training this late? That makes you either a bad kid or a good Trainer. Which one is it? 
Whether there are problems or not, or if crimes have been committed or not, I still go out on patrol. 
Big trouble! Officer in need of assistance! 
Your toughness is too much! I’m in serious trouble! 
I don’t know how to say this, but maybe we patrol too much. 
Let me ask you a question! Are you tough enough to take me? 
Can’t you see I’m fishing? Don’t talk! You’ll spook the fish! 
How do you like that? Both my catch and the win got away! 
Fishing and battling are delicate things--as am I. Is that wrong? 
You can see I’m fishing, can’t you? Then don’t talk to me! Geez! 
I wish some fishing-loving lady’d come along. But no, it’s all just Trainers. 
Sure, so I lost. But I’ll keep on fishing. 
If you know of any ladies that like fishing, help me reel ’em in! 
Umm... Yeah. Weren’t you that person who preferred Pokémon over fishing? 
Water Pokémon sure get happy when it rains. So do I! 
Oof. Just got trampled right under your feet that time! 
Yup, a kid like you should be running around outside, rain or shine. 
I’ve been fishing here ever since I lost to you. 
Hi, Trainer! Can you keep up with me? 
You’ve got energy to burn! 
Even if a battle gets heated, don’t break branches off trees or anything. 
You’re that energetic Trainer! I bet you can’t keep up this time! 
Heya, Trainer! Are you being good to Mother Nature? 
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted Trainer. 
Listen, people and Pokémon, we’re all a part of Mother Nature. 
Heya, long time! Are you enjoying your nature-filled adventure with Pokémon? 
Protect the natural environment. That’s what we Rangers do! 
We’ve got to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here. I wish I could live out here. 
What do you think? The environment is unharmed in this area. 
                   
                             
                                          
                               
                             
       
                                                           
                                          
I find it reassuring to be on this damp soil... 
Ufufufufu... You had to beat me... 
It feels good to mope here after a loss... Ufufufufu... 
Is Damp my favorite Pokémon ability? Fufufu... Anything will do... 
                             
                
                                   
                            
       
                                 
                  
                           
                             
                           
I’m proud of my Pokémon! Here, I’ll show you why! 
Youch! You sure showed me how tough you were. 
Oh, what have we here? That’s a Pokédex! It records Pokémon data upon sight? I’ve never seen one before! I heard you can move the sun or moon icon to check the Pokémon habitat map by time of day! 
I take down details in my notebook about Pokémon I’ve battled. I’ll write more data down about your Pokémon! 
Oh? Here comes a nice-looking Trainer. This is worth evaluation. 
Our research has arrived at this one conclusion: you’re a tough one! 
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the Great Marsh. You see, countless years ago, this whole area was under the sea. 
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate how much tougher you’ve become since our last encounter? 
There are Pokémon that grow stronger when it’s raining. 
Like rain, my tears flow from losing... They call me the Rain Woman... 
I want to show off my pretty parasol, but it will get dirty in the rain. Oh, such a big dilemma! 
On rainy days, I get more energetic! 
When it rains, I get more tense! 
It’s not very easy trying to battle while holding an umbrella. 
If it rained every day, I could have my umbrella open all the time. 
It’s not because it’s raining. I just love umbrellas! 
Your whole atmosphere is shady. Cooperate in this investigation! 
Defeated by sneakiness... 
I mistook your toughness as shadiness! It’s an honest mistake! 
We’re constantly on patrol. That way, it’s safe even at night. 
Whoa! Hold it right there! I’ve spotted a sneaky Trainer! 
I swim the whole year round. I’m not losing a battle at sea! 
I lost at sea! But I swim here the whole year round! 
When you’re out at sea, Water-type Pokémon look more lively. 
I love the sea. It was only by fluke that I lost last time. 
Brr... I’m starting to get chilly. I could use a win to get warmed up. 
The chill of the sea, and the coldness of defeat... It’s a double whammy. 
Look at my lips... They’re the color of prunes! 
Brr... I’m starting to feel chilly. How about a hot Pokémon battle? 
Hi, wave-riding Trainer! How about a battle on the sea? 
You sure schooled me there. 
Maybe I should switch to surfing, too... 
Hi, we meet again! Wave-riding Trainer! 
Hello, there! Aren’t you going to swim? 
What’s saltier? My tears or the sea... 
There aren’t many sea routes that you can swim in Sinnoh. It makes me want to take a vacation in the Hoenn region. 
When I see people surfing, I don’t feel jealous or anything. I just simply love to swim! 
Isn’t this nice? I love my inflatable tube! 
It’s not easy trying to move holding on to this inflatable tube. 
Mom blew up my inflatable tube for me. I ran out of breath just opening it! 
You can come back all you like, but you can’t have my inflatable tube! 
Ehehe... I can battle, too! 
Losing made me all hungry now. 
That cloud looks like giant ice cream! I bet it tastes yummy! 
I’ve been dawdling here all this time! 
                
         
                               
Traveling alone, are you? That’s impressive! How about we battle? 
You’re good, pip-squeak! 
Maybe I’ll go work out down at the restaurant again. That place gets different people in every day, and they all like battles. 
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let’s break the monotony with another battle! 
Waah! Now! Just now! I was just about to reel it in! 
You need to have more respect for a grown-up... 
Go on. Don’t be shy about going up to people to hear what they have to say... Just don’t you talk to me. 
Waah! Now! Just now! I was just about to reel it in! ...Right. You again! 
                             
                       
                                    
                       
                             
                              
                          
                                  
Let me demonstrate my technique. It’s how this grown-up battles. 
Oh, my gosh! You attack that savagely? 
You’re so much more of a Trainer than you look! 
OK, this time I’ll really show you how a grown-up battles! 
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer! I challenge you to battle with the Pokémon I’ve found! 
It’s a challenge trying to win with Pokémon one isn’t familiar with... 
Discovery is the treasure I seek. Collecting a lot is my life! 
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer! I challenge you to battle with the Pokémon I’ve found! 
I travel all over the world in search of mysteries. 
Gasp... One more... Gasp... It’s like I went on a diet... 
There are mysteries waiting for me to investigate around the world. This is no time to be feeling sorry for myself. 
There’s an endless supply of mysteries around the world. Running into you here just happens to be one such mystery! 
                                                       
                
                           
                 
                
                            
                          
                
                        
                     
                        
                               
I’d sensed the presence of a Trainer for a while. It was you! 
Defeating you will be no easy matter. 
Is it possible to become more powerful by understanding Pokémon? 
I was certain that you’d return. I sensed your presence, you see. 
There! Behind you! 
My plan to spook you didn’t go over well at all. 
You might be tough, but let down your guard at your own risk! 
Wah! That thing curled around your neck! ...Nice scarf, kid! 
When I toss this coin, you call it. Heads, we battle. Tails, we battle! Now, how will this play out, my friend? 
The coin came up tails, and like it, my Pokémon is facedown... 
I flipped a coin when I was ten. I decided to live in Sinnoh then. 
Luck wasn’t with me last time, but I’m feeling good about this. My lucky coin tells me so! 
For the sake of my collection, I take on people I know I can’t beat. That’s what a Collector does. 
That attack right then was remarkable! You ought to be proud of it! 
I take pride in having Pokémon that others don’t. Oh, I’m also proud about winning second prize in one of Jubilife TV’s drawings. 
For the sake of my collection, I keep battling people I can’t beat. That’s what a Collector does. 
What’s that?! You say you have a Pokédex? An authentic one! 
Your Pokédex fills me with such envy, envy, envy... 
There’s all kinds of Trainers with all sorts of Pokémon with them. The more you battle, the more your Pokédex is filled! 
Ooh, thank you! You came back to show me your Pokédex because I don’t have one! 
To find my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west, or any which way! 
But they’re rare Pokémon! 
If you’re trying to find the Pokémon you want, you need to go everywhere! Not just east and west, either. South and north are important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west, or any which way! ...Saying that, I’ve been wandering around here all this time. 
Oh? A little kid like you is going to teach me about Pokémon? 
Wow, is that right? 
There are so many kinds of Pokémon. I can’t decide which one to pamper. 
Yoohoo, little kid! Can you teach me some more about Pokémon? 
                          
                 
                         
                        
               
                               
                         
                   
                    
                               
                       
                      
                               
                              
                            
                                                      
You come along with your heart pounding! You think you can win like that?! Hiyah! 
Gurgle... 
If I lose here, I wouldn’t stand a chance at the Battle Frontier. Not against those hard-core pros, I wouldn’t! 
Am I lost, you ask? I merely feigned it! Hiyah! 
Check the sharpness of my fighting Pokémon’s moves. 
You’ve dulled its sharpness... 
Back to training for us! 
I sharpened my Pokémon’s moves more for when I saw you again! 
Every drop of sweat I shed makes me that much stronger! 
I should be lighter by the amount of sweat I just shed! 
It’s time for another workout. The more I sweat, the tougher I get! 
We’re going to win this time! Don’t believe me? Then you test it out! 
Hufff-huff, huff-huff. Want-huff a battle-huff? 
Huff-huff, we-huff lose-huff. 
Bye-huff now-huff. Huff-huff, huff-huff. 
Running-huff is-huff good-huff. Over-huff doing-huff it isn’t-huff! Huff-huff, huff-huff. 
Huff-huff, huff-huff. We-huff meet-huff again-huff? 
I’ll take on anyone! It can only make me stronger! 
You won and I lost, but the both of us gained something from this. 
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn’t matter how old or young you are. Your gender doesn’t matter, either. Nothing like that means anything! 
I’ll battle against people who’ve beaten me again and again. By doing that, we both grow a little as Trainers. 
I’m taking the Veilstone Gym challenge. But first... 
...My confidence is crushed. 
I think about Pokémon all day long. I was confident, you know. 
Oh, it’s you again! I’ve regained my confidence. Let’s have another battle! 
I’m a treasure hunter. Today, the loot is a victory from you! 
I can’t win. You’re too strong for me to win. 
If one’s after treasures, maybe the Underground is the better choice. 
I’m a treasure hunter. This time for sure, the loot is victory over you! 
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace? 
My pace is completely off... 
Sticking to one’s own goal is more important than it seems. If you match your goal with someone else, you’ll lose your identity. 
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk. I even stop on occasion. I am human, after all. 
Up till now, I’d maintained my pace. But seeing you threw me off! 
                        
                              
                       
I’m an elite battler, but cold is my nemesis! 
But, how...? Am I weak at battling, too? 
I’d rather be asleep in the lodge’s bed... I can’t take this cold... 
I’m an elite at battling, but cold is my nemesis! 
I always play for keeps! This isn’t practice! 
Good job! That was an excellent battle. 
If you don’t play for keeps, you’ll lose battles you should be dominating. 
When I lost to you last time, I was battling for keeps. But this time, I really mean it. This is seriously for keeps! 
I’m fully kitted up and equipped! Anytime will be fine! 
Hunh?! 
Perhaps I should maybe change into a more comfy outfit... 
I’m fully equipped again today! Anytime you’re ready will be fine! 
To be ready to answer any call! To be ready to accept any challenge! That is the way of a Trainer! 
Oh, yeah? Eat snowball, punk! 
You can make all the preparations in the world, but if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. 
I got everything ready so we could have a rematch whenever you come. 
I’m skiing right now, but OK. As we Skiers say, “Spur thing!” 
...I’ve hit an ice patch! 
I quite enjoyed that battle! Let us meet again. Slalom! 
We might get snowbound, but why not? It’s on the “spur” of the moment! 
Are you a novice? Or around midlevel? 
I never expected you to be an expert... 
You know how to play your Pokémon with an edge! 
Knowing you to be an expert, I challenge you to a rematch! 
The fun things about winter! One, skiing! Two, Pokémon! 
Snivel...
If it was skiing, I wouldn’t lose. I should go ski with my Pokémon... 
You’re a better Trainer than a skier. But I’ll challenge you again anyway! 
How do you expect to battle in this heavy snow? 
The winds of victory shifted... 
It’s so cold here, but here you are, so full of energy. I guess you kids are made tougher than people my age. 
Why would you wander around here? You must really like this area. 
I can withstand this cold. That means I can take any kind of attack! 
Huh? It’s over, you say? 
Oh, gosh, this is bad! I think I’m losing feeling all over my body! 
Oh? I’ve seen your face before. What say we battle? 
This cold is but nothing compared to the fire that burns in my heart! 
Your heart burns as hot as mine! 
The weather clears up sometimes. The view is breathtaking then. 
We’ll come at you with our hearts ablaze! 
Wh-what is it? P-Pokémon battle?! 
Whew... You are alive, aren’t you? 
Around these parts, perhaps because of all the snow, there are many folktales of hauntings... 
This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve trained since then! 
I’ll show you the techniques I had drummed into me at ski school! 
I don’t believe it... My techniques were rebuffed... 
Maybe I should’ve studied at the Trainers’ school instead... 
Since I lost to you last time, I redid my training at ski school! 
We Skiers feel Mother Nature through the soles of our feet! 
I got a good taste of your power! 
Trainers get an appreciation of life through Pokémon. At least I think so. 
I knew you were headed here. I felt it with the soles of my feet! 
I’ve been skiing with Pokémon since I was just five years old. 
Hunh, what...? I repeat, hunh, what...? 
The scenery doesn’t change very much around here. Don’t go getting lost! 
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again? You should pay more attention! 
Rainy days make me feel blue... But the instant it starts to snow, I’m as happy as can be! 
The conditions weren’t very good. 
Can any of your Pokémon use that hidden move to climb cliffs? 
You really must like snow. After all, if you didn’t, I doubt that you’d come here so often! 
Poof! You’ve got a good eye spotting me! 
You also saw through my weak spots... 
I’ll play with my Pokémon--even in a blizzard! 
Poof! You saw through my camouflage again! 
There are several clans of ninjas. Are you from the Iga clan? Or Kouga? 
I’m not much of a ninja either way... 
I wonder why everyone stops being a ninja when they grow up? 
I forged my willpower in the snow! Witness my snowy might! 
I dress light wherever I go. Hiyah! 
Achoo! 
Maybe I’ll dress warm and come back. Hiyah! 
Lightly dressed like always. Hiyah! 
                              
       
                    
                                
         
                 
                                           
         
                          
                                    
            
                       
Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting! 
Can’t catch a fish! Can’t catch a break! 
I was counting on strength in numbers, but... Packing it in and going home sounds good at a time like this... 
Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting today either. 
                                   
     
                  
                                             
                                 
     
              
                
Outdoor fishing for the win! Shouting doesn’t help my fishing any, but shout I must! 
Gwaaah! This is hurting! 
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring away the Pokémon. 
Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn’t help! 
Let it rock! It’s the rhythm of battle! 
Can you hear it? That’s my guitar weeping... 
I’m too torn up to sing anymore... I am so cool that way... 
Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again! Our rhythm of battle! 
A man of the sea is also a man of Pokémon! 
Anchors away! 
You’ve got what it takes to be a Trainer among Trainers! 
Hard to starboard! That’s a sharp turn to the right! Hard to port! And that’s a sharp turn to the left! 
                 
                          
                               
                                         
              
                               
                      
       
                          
I love my inflatable tube. So I admire jellyfish Pokémon! 
I’m drifting away... 
I wish Professor Rowan would give me a Pokédex. But that old guy looks kind of scary. 
I love my inflatable tube. So I admire jellyfish Pokémon. Won’t you hang out with us and just bob around on the waves? 
I can’t swim without my inflatable tube. But my Pokémon might be strong! 
They weren’t tough, my Pokémon... 
My mommy said that Professor Rowan is really kindhearted.
Oh! You’re the Trainer who played with us before! Can you see if my Pokémon have grown stronger? 
I only live to swim. Teach me what’s so fun about Pokémon! 
Oh, yeah, that was fun! I learned something good! 
It’s what I live for! Pokémon! 
Hey, didn’t you teach me what’s so fun about Pokémon? Teach me more. I’m eager to learn! 
On your marks, get set, go! ...When I say that, let’s start. 
Yow-ow-ow-ow! My leg’s cramped up! 
I forgot to do my stretching exercises... 
Hi, I was waiting for you! Ready? On your marks, get set... 
OK! Get your breathing in order! OK! You’re ready to go! 
I let my momentum falter... 
Listen, I have something important to say to you. Don’t drown in your own talent. 
OK! You’re ready to go! This time, I’m going for the win! 
Swimming is a workout for your entire body. Jump in and swim! Swim, you! 
Sunk like a stone! 
Well, Pokémon’s one thing, but you should take up swimming, too! 
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer! You should be swimming like me! 
The human body floats more easily in the sea, so it’s easy to swim! 
The sea is salty, but all I taste is bitterness... 
I’ve got that sinking feeling... 
Pokémon can stay afloat even while carrying someone. That’s so cool! 
I may not look it now, but I’m a star. I’m always with my Pokémon. 
I lost, but at least I had fun. 
If it were an underwater Pokémon show, I would have shined. 
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our Pokémon show again? 
I bought a new bikini! It’s this year’s newest model! 
Psssssh! 
I bought the wrong size of bikini. It’s a little too snug... 
Did I show you already? My bikini, new for this year! 
                              
                  
                             
                               
                     
              
                
                 
Well? Does it look like I’m swimming gracefully? 
I’m finally feeling fatigued... 
I may look like I’m swimming gracefully, but beneath the surface I’m kicking furiously. 
You were attracted by my graceful swimming again, weren’t you? 
One thing about Water-type Pokémon: There’s a huge variety! I’ll show you the Water-type Pokémon I chose and why I’m so proud of them! 
I can’t boast when I lose... I’m so disappointed... 
Sure I lost, but watch me! I’ll get tougher with water Pokémon. 
This time, my water Pokémon will show you why I’m so proud of them! 
I like fishing, no question. But battling? That’s what I love! 
Sploosh! 
If you don’t know how to fish, you’re missing half of life’s enjoyment. If you don’t know Pokémon... You’re missing out on all of it! 
Come on, battle me again! You know I love to fish and battle! 
                                
        
                                   
They call me an Ace Trainer. Allow me to demonstrate the talent that makes me so! 
I’m burning with jealousy over your raw talent! 
I think keeping up the effort to better yourself is a talent in itself. 
Last time, I stumbled before I could showcase my talent. This time, I’ll conclusively demonstrate the might of an Ace Trainer! 
Really? So you think you can beat me? I’m an Ace Trainer, you do realize? 
I admit defeat... 
Beaten in battle, but not in spirit. That’s the mark of a real Ace Trainer. 
Ace Trainers always work to improve their natural-born talents. 
Are you going to the Pal Park, too? For you, I’m willing to show off my prized Pokémon! 
So? Hot stuff, huh? That’s why I’m so proud of my Pokémon! 
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of Pokémon you can see there? 
Listen, did you go to the Pal Park? What was it like? What was it like? 
Well, I am fishing, but... Very well! I accept your challenge! 
A bittersweet smile is on my lips. 
I’ve gone down in defeat. Whatever more is there to say? 
Well, just as before, I’m fishing, but... Very well! I accept your challenge! 
Hi, traveler! How would you like to battle? 
You’ve bested this fisherman traveler. 
I like to fish. You’re a traveler. Farewell, until we meet again! 
Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve battled before, haven’t we? 
I’m getting bored of fishing. Let’s have a quick battle! 
I’ve been done in... 
Thanks for that! It was a good change of pace for me. 
Yo! I remember how our battle was a good change of pace before. Let’s have another quick battle! 
If I stare at the water’s surface for too long, I begin to forget what I was doing in the first place. 
I don’t know how, but I lost! 
Oh, right... I was fishing, wasn’t I? 
When I looked up from staring at the water’s surface, I saw your face. I’m not sure about what I was just doing, but do you want to battle? 
                    
    
                
                
      
                 
                                                                      
                       
                                                        
                                 
     
                               
My dream’s a big one! I want to battle every kind of Pokémon from around the world! 
I lost, but I am one step closer to realizing my dream! 
Listen, you! Whatever happens, never lose sight of your dream! 
All right, you! Help me realize my dream of battling every kind of Pokémon there is! 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. Sing it! 
Your Pokémon... They’re looking good! 
You ought to think about becoming a Sailor yourself. It’s been great to be able to visit different places around the world. 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. You sing, too! 
Who’s there?! What do you think you’re doing?! 
I happen to be rather jumpy, so everyone looks suspicious to me. 
I’m easy to scare, and yet here I am on patrol. Funny how things go. 
At night, I get tense and nervous. I don’t know why. 
I’ll repeat myself! Who’s there?! What do you think you’re doing?! 
I need to escape these doldrums... You can keep me company. 
That did liberate me from the doldrums, but at what price...  
I’m going back to the hotel to rest! I find you exceedingly tiresome! 
I’m afraid I’m in the doldrums again. You shall keep me company again! 
                                 
            
                                             
                                
                       
                               
After enjoying a meal at the hotel restaurant, one has a battle. That’s the social etiquette. 
Enchanting. 
Personally, I would much rather pamper Pokémon than make them battle. 
I only seem to run into you after I go to the restaurant. Etiquette calls for a battle after a meal. Shall we? 
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon! It’s really cool! 
Wowee! I had to hold on tight to my inflatable tube! 
Pools are OK, but I like the sea because Pokémon live there. 
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon again, right? Look, look! 
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what kind of Pokémon you have? 
You’re so tough. I’m stunned... 
I want to hang on to a BUIZEL and just bob around. 
Listen, listen! Did you find any new kinds of Pokémon? 
                          
           
                               
                            
                
                   
                                 
                 
                 
                  
                           
I came out here because I wanted to see the Pokémon League for myself. 
I’m shocked... No, really, I am. 
The way I battle now, well, I can only look at the Pokémon League! You, go on! You go to the Pokémon League for me, too! 
I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the Pokémon League. 
I’ve decided! I’m off to the Pokémon League if I win! 
Blblblblugh... 
It’s OK. Just let me float away like driftwood... 
This is it! I’m going to beat you, then I’m off to the Pokémon League! 
It might not look like it, but I’m traveling now. 
You’ve got the upper hand on me. 
But you can be sure that there will be bigger challenges in front of you. Go! Go as far as you can! You alone can broaden your horizons. 
I’m still on my journey... Let’s have a battle! 
The sea around these parts is harsh. As am I! 
The world is so harsh... 
What? You’ve got that many Gym Badges? No wonder you’re so tough... 
It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have toughened me up more! 
To swim every sea there is... That’s my dream! 
Boo! I’m not done with my dream! 
What is the sea like in places like the Kanto and Hoenn regions? 
Challenging every Pokémon League... That’s another of my dreams! 
Yes, I know I can surf, but I’d rather swim instead. It does seem weird, I agree. 
Kaploosh! 
If you don’t know how, I’m willing to show you how to swim. 
If you rely on your Pokémon all the time, you’ll never learn how to swim! 
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too. Don’t think you’re going to win easily! 
Master Wake... I mean, Crasher Wake, sorry! 
What to do... Train at the Gym again, or train by myself... 
I trained at the Gym after you beat me. Let’s do it, gang! 
I’m determined to go to the Pokémon League, no matter how hard it is. 
Th-this is so hard... 
Losing won’t make me quit. I mean, this is my dream! The Pokémon League isn’t going anywhere, either. 
It doesn’t matter how long it takes, I’m going to the Pokémon League! 
Excuse me for wearing my bikini! 
Was I multitasking too much, battling and swimming at the same time? 
When I’m in my bikini, I’m at a loss about where to carry my Poké Balls! 
Giggle... Excuse me for wearing my bikini! 
Deep breathing before battle! Breathe in...and out! 
Breathe in...and out. Breathe in...and out! 
Deep breathing after battle, too! Breathe in...and out! 
Deep breathing always! Breathe in...and out! 
Your Pokémon doesn’t seem to be tiring at all from carrying you on its back. Let me see how strong it is! 
I can’t take any more... I’m all tired out! 
While floating here, I think about everything and nothing. Like how I should battle next, and what’s for dinner tomorrow, and... 
How much stronger have your Pokémon become? Let me check ’em out, OK? 
Did you know, I was crowned the champion of a swimsuit contest! So now, I’m trying to win a title at a Pokémon Contest! 
I’m speechless! I never lose when I’m in my swimsuit! 
I shouldn’t be worried about what bikini to wear. The first thing to do is consider what Pokémon I should be using! 
I’m so wonderful, I won a swimsuit contest. I’m going to take you on so that I can win a Pokémon Contest! 
My favorite kind of guy is someone that looks good out on the open sea! 
The tide is going out... 
Don’t get me wrong, it’s not as if I don’t like mountain men. But, you know, my most favorite kind of guy looks great with Pokémon! 
Hello again! You’re that Trainer who looks keen with your Pokémon! 
Fine, all righty then. Just a quick battle on my break! 
Wahaha! Mercy, I cry mercy! 
I’d better get on back to work... You know, I’d rather be traveling around with Pokémon the way you do. 
I’m gonna let you in on a secret... I snuck my Pokémon to work! 
Well, now aren’t you something! 
OK, OK, time for work! I’ll work up a thirst with my Pokémon! 
                           
              
                 
                           
                
                           
                                 
           
                               
                                                
                          
                         
What’s cool, you might ask? No? I’ll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon! 
Don’t ignore bug Pokémon! That really bugs me! 
It would seem that coolness alone doesn’t add up to any wins... 
Here comes the swarm! 
Whoooh... 
There’s a Pokémon ability named Swarm. 
My senses tingle... I’ve spotted a rare Pokémon! 
Awawawawah... 
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but it turned out to be just a Trainer! 
We’re just out on a power walk! 
Oh, you! 
You can’t avoid bug Pokémon ever in the forest. I didn’t have any Antidotes with me, either. It was the worst! 
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond as one, a wondrous power is born... 
Urmmm... Urrrrmmmmm... 
There still remain many mysteries yet to be solved in this strange world... 
A strange presence has been felt... It is emanating from...you! 
Oh, no! My MEDITITE!
The Old Chateau... I sense... a particularly strong presence there.
I see it... I see it... I see you going down in defeat... 
It is I that has gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau... There should be none alive in it... And yet there is a pervasive sense of a presence...
This forest is strange, you know... It seems to fill me with energy... 
Your victory... There is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem to gather such unexplainable energy.
                         
               
                               
                                  
                            
                 
                             
                                  
                        
                 
                                                
                  
                 
                                           
                              
               
                                 
                             
            
                   
                                
                
                            
                                             
                
                
                                 
            
                        
                                       
               
                                 
                                                 
                  
                      
                           
        
                                   
                                               
               
                                   
                                                           
              
                                
                  
               
                            
                  
             
                          
                             
    
            
                                   
              
                                        
                         
                             
               
               
                  
You... One look at you tells me you’re a real contender! 
You’re as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other side of the road when I walk by ’em. It’s a goal of mine I’m working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as if my journey is now coming to an end. But, before the final chapter is written, I must pen your defeat! 
That wasn’t how I planned the final chapter to go in my writing class...
If you don’t give up, you can reach your goal. That perseverance is what’s important to Trainers. That’s in my book, too.
Show me how you’ve battled to get here! Let’s do this! 
So, that’s how you battled...? 
Once you emerge from Victory Road, the Pokémon League lies directly ahead... But many Trainers fail to ever find their way on Victory Road... 
This total stranger’ll be a good way to see if I have what it takes to own the Pokémon League’s Elite Four! 
That battle just now must make you tougher than everyone in the world. 
It doesn’t appear as if anyone could even try to stand against your might. The Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have a lot of trust in you. You and your Pokémon... You seem to be aglow. 
Ah, I understand it now! 
Neither Pokémon nor people live forever. But it is the very frailty of life that allows us to shine!
Let me see how well your Pokémon can battle! 
Brilliant! 
Rather than navigating Victory Road, I have a much better time putting young Trainers like you to the test. 
I take Pokémon that are tough to begin with and toughen them up even more. You can help me! 
There’s no way I could have won! 
How should I teach the most powerful of the Dragon-type moves...? 
This is a place where tough Trainers naturally congregate. It’s ideal for training! 
That’s why I like it here; I get to battle tough characters like you. 
When two roads diverge, you must choose the path less traveled... 
My Pokémon knows karate! I’m warning you, it’s a tough one! 
I’ve met my match in strength! 
I’ve made it this far in life using the karate I learned on the Internet! 
I keep battling so I can soar ever higher into the skies! 
It seems I’ve been grounded... 
The wings of freedom... I know I’ll find them if I can win my way through the Pokémon League... 
I am a Psychic! I can see your future! 
So be it! I will now divulge what I know of your future... Hmm! 
I see it now! You will battle the Elite Four of the Pokémon League! 
I am a Psychic! I can see your past! 
Your past... You’ve been through a lot... 
Let me guess. Have you met any legendary Pokémon? 
Pat: It’s a doubles team of aces! We’re gonna overwhelm you! 
Pat: You and your Pokémon will gain power by helping each other out. 
Pat: The combination of you and your awesome Pokémon... It’s the ultimate tag team! 
Pat: If you don’t mind, we’re hoping for some two-on-two battle action. 
Jo: We form a combination that’s in perfect sync! How do you expect to counter that? 
Jo: You and your Pokémon make a beautiful combination! 
Jo: Yup, the way you battle is fantastic! You should try to take the Elite Four right now--not later! 
Jo: We want to have a battle without an advantage. Please come back when you have at least two Pokémon! 
Al: I intend to perfect my Double Battle technique. That will make me better all around. 
Al: You! You’re an expert double battler, too! 
Al: Your mastery over several Pokémon at once... You’re a remarkable Trainer! 
Al: You have but one Pokémon? I would say that you are taking Victory Road too lightly, kid. 
Kay: I want to improve my doubles technique as much as I can. That will improve me as a Trainer. 
Kay: My goodness! You’re great at doubles, too!
Kay: Depending on the combinations, every kind of Pokémon can excel. At least, that’s what I think. 
Kay: You’re really going through Victory Road with only one Pokémon? 
We Trainers will accept challenges anywhere! It’s what we do. 
Hmm... Insufficiently raised? 
Pokémon can appear anywhere in a cave. It’s not like the tall grass by roads. 
To celebrate my getting through this cave, I’m going to battle you! 
Well, I guess losing is something to commemorate, too... 
Getting through that cave feels like an adventure. 
I’m a Veteran, yes, but don’t you dare treat me like a senior citizen! 
Grrr... So young, and yet so talented! 
I’ll always remain young at heart. Never let them say you’re too old! 
                                                       
          
                        
                                         
              
                                        
                         
               
               
Oh, what’s this? My last one! This is where we make our stand! 
We’re not done yet! There’s no giving up! 
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated! 
Aiyaah! We’re coming out swinging with super-heavy judo chops! 
That was... A complete trashing! 
I must rededicate myself to training. The road extends into infinity... 
Up and down you go on the lifts. Me? I like to battle! 
You’ve got me feeling down! 
I can’t keep this up! I’ll go back to working on the lifts. 
A Pokémon Gym isn’t only about seeing how tough your Pokémon happen to be. It’s so much deeper than just that. It’s a test of you as a person. 
That move was devastating! 
I get to work all day with my Pokémon, and even battle sometimes. I get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and experience of battling at high levels. I’ll demonstrate what that means to a noob like you! 
Wow... I’m in the mood to sing a lullaby... 
Your earnest enthusiasm... I guess that kinda makes you an ace. Maybe you’re a Trainer who has the potential to surpass aces! 
By focusing on only one type, you can really see the strengths and weaknesses of that Pokémon. 
My focus was too narrow minded...
Start by becoming friendly with your Pokémon. I mean really friendly. If you do that, you’ll learn naturally how you should battle with it. 
Steel represents an unbending spirit! If one refuses to accept defeat, the path to victory reveals itself! 
I never gave up, but still I failed to win... 
If you give up, well, that’s when everything ends for you! 
Pokémon and people have worked together for many years. Let us show you an example of that history! 
A spectacular loss! But it’s still a loss! 
The way you helped each other... That is what made you prevail! 
What do you think you’re doing to my Pokémon?!
This can’t be?! I lost?! You...you uppity brat! 
Oi! This is no fun and games! This is proper work, I tell you! 
What...?! Some brat messed up my job... 
Team Galactic needs electricity for doing something big! 
Collecting electricity from the Valley Windworks... That’s our mission. 
I really don’t like kids who also happen to be tough Trainers... 
You don’t have an inkling of what Team Galactic is trying to achieve! Of course, they don’t tell a grunt like me anything, either... But still! 
...This is why I’m gonna be stuck as a grunt forever... 
...I want a promotion so I can get some tougher Pokémon... 
Don’t get cocky! This isn’t over yet! 
My Pokémon’s getting low on HP... Things could be tight here. 
What just happened? I lost?! 
Don’t get cocky! This isn’t over yet! 
My Pokémon’s getting low on HP... Things could be tight here. 
What just happened? I lost?! 
We were having a heated discussion over Pokémon the way Collectors do. 
Knowledge alone isn’t everything, you know... 
I’m more knowledgeable than anyone else! I have a rare Pokémon! But, I’m weak at battling... That’s a Pokémon Collector for you...
I’m a Collector, and I love Honey! 
What’ve you done to my Pokémon?! It took me forever to catch it using Honey! 
I went through a lot of bother to catch my Pokémon. But since I’ve not raised it, it’s as weak as when I caught it. 
Welcome! This place is my pride and joy! 
I take losses with an unusually big smile! Do you find that odd at all? 
After a match, you should have some Moomoo Milk to quench your thirst! Just chug it right down! Glug glug! 
                                                                   
                   
                              
                                                                
                   
                                 
                                                                  
                   
                                   
                            
                 
                   
                                 
                   
                  
It’s not the end yet.
Are you saying something? You think you have me cornered? 
Amazing! You’re very good, aren’t you? 
Giggle! You found me! Of course, let’s battle! 
Aww, boo! Look, you’ve beaten me! 
Giggle! There’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on, don’t be afraid! 
A forest inside a Gym... Shocking, isn’t it? 
Giggle... The clock will turn now. 
OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past two boulders. 
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out special attacks... I won’t let you win easily! 
The more beautiful a flower, the faster it withers... 
Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer... In the middle of three trees. That’s my hint. Good luck. 
Even concealed, there is no hiding the aroma of flowers. 
Just like your inability to conceal your abundant skill. 
Your next opponent is under four flowers. 
Hey! That there! That was a good move! 
This is where it gets exciting! 
Hunwah! It’s gone and ended! How will I say this... I want more! I wanted to battle a lot more! 
I’ve landed the most fish Pokémon in the world. I’m next! 
Being number one in the world doesn’t mean a thing... 
I figure I got too wrapped up in fishing and neglected training. 
I wield the stupendous power of water! Don’t think you can win! 
But the kid wins anyway! I’m just bowled over! 
The water rising and falling is tricky, but don’t let it annoy you. If you lose sight of yourself, that’s when you’re set to lose. 
I’ve been around the world, going from place to place training Pokémon. It’s this Gym I’ve chosen to make my home! You can bet it’s tough! 
You! You’re truly top-class tough! 
If you were to go around the world, I’m sure you’d meet tougher Pokémon. 
Like the raging sea, I crash down and wash away everything before me! That’s just how I roll! 
That wave didn’t even wash my hands... 
I’m now becalmed like a waveless sea... 
My body isn’t the only thing I work on toughening up here. I also work on my Pokémon and my spirit! 
Wow, Trainer! You just might be tougher than our Gym Leader! 
Maybe I’ll do like Wake, I mean, Crasher Wake, and wear the same kind of mask. 
I want to become a strong Trainer like Crasher Wake! 
Groan... You’re too much. 
Maybe I’ll do like Wake... I mean, Crasher Wake, and use the same kinds of Pokémon. 
                                              
                     
                           
                                
      
                                  
                                                              
                           
                              
                                  
                      
                                 
Oh! But this isn’t the end, my friend! 
I’m in a bit of a bind, aren’t I? 
I shall admit defeat... You are much too strong. 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for love with my fist! Hiyah, looooooooove! 
Argh! Crunched! 
Your Pokémon sure are tough! But our Gym Leader Maylene will break you like a stack of bricks! 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for courage with my fist! Hiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage! 
I couldn’t force my way to victory... 
To overwhelm by force... That is my ideal beat-down style. It doesn’t seem to work that way with Pokémon, however. 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for hope with my fist! Hiyah, hoooooooooooooope! 
We came up short, but not by much. 
I’ll have to redo my training, though. Maylene’s gonna trample me again... 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for tears with my fist! Hiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars! 
I’m so hungry, kid... I don’t have any strength left... 
I lost because I didn’t eat enough pizza. ...No. Anything I say will sound like I’m making excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this? Is this my final Pokémon? 
Never give up, never surrender! 
You are so fantastically strong. I know now why I have lost. 
I’ve been to all sorts of places. That means I know tons of things! 
Yeah, whatever. You can battle, too... 
I’m gonna visit new places and find new Pokémon so I’ll be a know-it-all! 
What, were you just dawdling around hoping I’d notice you for a battle? You know you’re going to get whupped here, don’t you? 
I kinda deserved that, didn’t I? I gotta stop mouthing off like that... 
I’ll remember you and your shifty Pokémon, too. I’m watching you... 
What does it feel like, taking one step after another into darkness? 
You’re the kind of person who can keep going forward even into the unknown. 
I think, sometimes, one has to make mistakes to learn what is right. 
Boo! Did I scare you? This battle will! 
Uh, whoopsie! That didn’t end well! 
Since you’re here, you might as well take on every Trainer. 
I’m not afraid of picnicking anywhere, so I’ve learned all sorts of things. 
Your toughness... It’s something new to me.
I’ve learned that Pokémon are fun ’cause everyone plays with ’em! 
Are you lost? Are you enjoying yourself? 
Let me guess. You are enjoying yourself. 
Whatever happens in life, it’s better to try to enjoy it the best one can. Being in the dark here, I came to realize that. 
Eek! That’s so bright! Surprise attack! 
Your strength is dazzling! I have to shield my eyes! 
I’m going over the reasons why I lost. That way, I’ll win next time. 
Hey, now! You’re not even close to the door yet. You have to beat me before you can go, you know? 
Argh! I should’ve dazzled you by shining my light in your eyes! 
Just walk around and look for the blue marks on the tiles. 
I’m going to break the ice and bring out my last-resort Pokémon! 
I can sense your will to win, but I promise you I’m not about to lose! 
I must say, I’ve warmed up to you! I might even admire you a little. 
...It’s t-too cold. I can’t even feel my t-tongue. 
This result... ...It’s cold. Bitter cold. 
The higher up you slide from, the more speed you’ll have to smash those big snowballs. 
My willpower was shaped and tempered by howling blizzards. I’ll bring it to bear on you! 
You weren’t even fazed... 
I’ve battled countless Trainers and many more Pokémon still. My spirit has been hardened from all the battles I have fought.
Is the Gym’s trick floor making you a little hot under the collar? If you can’t maintain your cool in battle, you’ll freeze up. 
You were surprisingly cool... At least I have my warm boots. 
Your Pokémon look so hot in battle. So hot, they’re cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling all run-down? But a good Trainer is one who wins no matter the situation! 
That’s right. A good Trainer will win, no matter what the situation may be. 
The Trainer’s feelings... The Pokémon’s feelings... If they are one and the same, you will never lose. 
                                 
                     
                           
                                             
         
                                                                   
I get it! You guys are tough! But we can match your toughness! 
This is it! My trump card! 
Shocking... I didn’t see this coming! 
You’ve got me beat... Your desire and the noble way your Pokémon battled for you... I even felt thrilled during our match. That was a very good battle. 
Wow! I’m surprised you’ve come this far, but you’ll have to turn back. There isn’t any chance that you could ever beat me! 
What makes your Pokémon so special? 
As a challenger, you’re one tough Trainer. 
I’m not just looking for tough Trainers to battle. I’ve been battling here because I want to feel the rush! 
Your power is thrilling... I’m thrilled down to my toes! 
I’m so glad that there are Pokémon! There isn’t much else that gives me the thrill that Pokémon do! 
I want to win! That desire I pour into my guitar! I want to win! That passion compels my Pokémon! 
We couldn’t win... No encores for us... 
The Trainer’s desire to win! If you don’t lose that, there’s no limit on what you can become! 
Spark! This is what our Gym Leader did to the Gym out of boredom! 
Spark... 
We were lacking energy... No, we lacked more than that. We didn’t want the win enough. 
Whether you’re a Trainer or a Guitarist, it takes dedication to improve your mad skills! 
My skills seem to have let me down. I must have been out of tune! 
The way you battle, I can feel the very heart of rock and roll. Tell me, are you maybe a fan of rocking out? 
Look at the way I’m dressed. Can’t you see that I’m hardcore? 
I was being serious! Don’t laugh at me! I mean it! 
I dress this way so I can get a feel for how electric Pokémon think. Would you like to try, too? 
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh. That’s why I’m here--to learn the best battle techniques around! 
...You’re tough. 
You just showed me that there’s still lots I need to learn. The world of Pokémon is deep! 
Can you make it to the Gym Leader? You sure now? 
The gears spin round and round... I spin down and out... 
Our Gym’s trick walkways are sure to make your head spin! 
My dragon Pokémon chose to become powerful here. They sure like it! 
Your battle style... So savage... 
It’s been several years since I left the Dragon’s Den. I’ve got to say, your Pokémon are in the top class for toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to become powerful. 
There’s something about you... You’re not just anybody. I challenge you! 
You’re at a different level of expertise for sure! 
You’ve won countless times... That has made you very powerful. 
There’s something about you... You still remain extraordinary. I challenge you again! 
I constantly analyze Pokémon and various battles on my laptop. 
...Things don’t always work out according to my calculations... 
I had a lot of fun battling with you, though. I wonder if I can analyze the battle data properly? I could use a rematch to get some additional data. 
I analyzed our last battle on my laptop. 
For some reason I was drawn here, and it is here that I met you... I want to know what all this means! 
I see... So that’s what it means... 
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic presence emanating from here... 
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to know what all this means! 
There is nothing here... And yet there is a power lurking... Were you drawn by it, as well? 
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather marvelous indeed... 
A place where nothing else exists... A place such as that is better suited to awaken the power within. 
Do you see now? You’ve come back again. There must be something that draws you to this place... 
I don’t care who you are--no one interferes with my treasure hunting! 
My Pokémon! My treasures! 
I heard there’s an intriguing stone monument around, so I came running. 
I’m still here...and still searching for treasures. However, a battle with you is a treasure I can’t pass up! 
All right, my Pokémon squad! Get out there and kick up a storm! 
The squad failed to hit its stride... 
Hmm... Gazing out over the sea doesn’t do a thing for toughening up my Pokémon! 
Ah, it’s been a long time! I have been toughening my fists against the sea, just as before! 
I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more Pokémon! So, what kind of a Trainer are you? 
I see... Simply outstanding.
I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more Pokémon. You’re a strong Trainer. Moreover, your heart is strong. 
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an excuse to slack off. I take pride in challenging those who have bested me before! 
Ugh... I didn’t use items effectively. 
I like to study a lot... I thought I could win... 
I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me! 
Ouch! Are you one of those loyal fans? You sure are rowdy! 
Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! Thank you for being such a fan! Just so you know, our latest single is “Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”! 
I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! We just might have a scoop here! 
My camera’s too heavy. I couldn’t battle effectively... 
The lively expressions on you and your Pokémon’s faces... It sure makes for some great TV! 
Your spirit’s vibes, man... I can feel that you’ve got rock in your soul! 
You beat me, man, but... I feel totally amped to jam harder! 
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit, too! That’s why battles rock! Rawk! 
You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK? 
The camera is our witness! It’s recorded our defeat... 
I’d like to take that footage and have it broadcast worldwide. 
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d have a great scene to shoot! 
So, let’s begin and find out what sort of a Trainer you are! 
You have a superstar quality! You sure could become a celebrity! 
I lost, but I’m totally thrilled! We just made some great TV! 
Oh, no. What we’re looking for is you to battle with two Pokémon! 
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am! Aren’t you having fun?! Let’s make it fun! OK?! Mwahahah! 
Oh, no, no, no! Mwahahah? 
A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while laughing. Mwahahah! It defines what we do! 
Po-Po-Pokémon! Do you think I’m a real Pokémon? 
Pi-Pikachu! 
I need to find a way to get more into the character of a Pokémon... 
Join me in this on-the-spot report, live at the scene of a battle! 
The media is the victim! 
Interviews are about taking the initiative. The people need to know. 
How is this madness possible? The two of us, losing to children? 
This won’t do... Time to retreat. This mission is a failure. 
How insolent. Take a bite of this, child! 
Losing to some child... Being careless cost me too much. 
We are acquiring Pokémon for a most astonishing undertaking! Your meddling won’t be tolerated! 
I feel like I got meddled with... 
Our astonishing undertaking is most certainly breathtaking. If you ever hope to see its glorious unveiling, then don’t meddle with us! 
                           
             
                                                       
Our objectives are incredible! Too incredible for me to understand! I’ll fight blindly to defend them, and your intrusion won’t be forgiven! 
What was I fighting for, again?
What do you have against taking Pokémon from others? Look in any field or forest! Those things aren’t exactly rare! 
                       
                         
                                                
So sorry, sweetie. Team Galactic has no room for kiddies! 
B-but, deary, you’re just a kid! 
You wanted to go up? Well, why didn’t you? 
Let’s see how good this Pokémon is! I stole it from some weak Trainer. 
What is this?! 
Wimpy little Pokémon... When I get promoted, I’ll demand better stolen Pokémon. 
Why, thank you! We love it when people come to us to donate their Pokémon! 
What do you think you’re doing?! 
You can catch Pokémon anywhere. What’s so special about them? Trainers that lose theirs should quit whining and catch some more! 
                                               
             
                                                                      
Ancient ruins rife with the UNOWN... There has to be a meaning! But its significance eludes me, and that’s gotten me cranky! 
The search must continue! 
The significance of the ancient ruins... Only Pokémon that look like the letters of some strange language... Can they be trying to convey a message to us? 
I can’t explain it... Being here compels me to battle! 
Hunh?! What was I just doing?! 
The desire to do battle lingers on... Do such spirits of Pokémon still roam within these walls? 
I need to shake off my sorrow... Please, battle with me! 
My sorrow has deepened... 
I won’t ever forget the Pokémon that I’ve spent time with, however fleeting. 
It makes no difference where we are. If you have Pokémon with you, I reckon you ought to battle. 
You’ve got a lot of giddyap and go in you! 
Over a long life, you’ll be certain to have some sad farewells. But I reckon there are also some new beginnings. 
Hahaha! I’m afraid y’all are no match for us with jus’ one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one. Lemme show you how much! 
Well! Aren’t you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower... Right’n here, inside my heart... Those are the places where my Pokémon remain... 
You haven’t got yerself two Pokémon? 
My Pokémon were taken from me... Team Galactic did it... Ever since, I’ve never forgiven their faces... 
Gwaaaaaah! 
I’m not doing my Pokémon any favors by ruining its memory like this... I can’t be wallowing around forever. I gotta move on and turn the page.
Mike: I can’t embarrass myself again. Not in front of my girlfriend! 
Mike: Awww, jeez. Man, that’s a downer... 
Mike: Coming here again brings back all kinds of memories of me and Nat. 
Mike: You can’t battle with us. Not with one Pokémon, anyway. 
Nat: I don’t want to look bad again. Not when my boyfriend is watching! 
Nat: This makes me feel hollow inside... Oh, so hollow... 
Nat: The Pokémon that brought me and Mike together is buried here... 
Nat: You do have at least two Pokémon, don’t you? 
Waah! Ghost! Get away! Eek! Help me, team! 
Hey... You’re no ghost... 
I had to come to the Lost Tower on a dare... I have to go to the top and use Defog there... 
Beating you would be my 100th straight win! Here’s to a fun battle! 
How could I lose now?! This is beyond aggravating! 
I wish I could beat Maylene in Veilstone City one day... 
Yeah, I like to camp! So what? Let’s battle! 
I should’ve just stuck to camping out here... 
When I’m with my Pokémon, I can camp just about anywhere I want! 
If we were to battle, your Pokémon  would become tougher. Likewise, my Pokémon would also become tougher. It’s all good. This calls for a battle! 
You know, I would have really enjoyed a win there. Would’ve been real nice. 
This mine’s been abandoned, but now it’s home to many Pokémon. I guess everything finds a place to call home someday...
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers... You tell me, where else can I find a place as good as this to train? 
That was good. You’ve bonded well with your Pokémon. 
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers... Their strength comes from their bond. And that’s something that can be made stronger anywhere. 
I’ll pound the fear of my fists into you all karate style, punk! 
I’m so sorry... I got a bit mouthy there, didn’t I? 
So, I’m gonna try and shatter steel! I wonder how many more years it would take for me to do that? 
Every good Hiker gets a boost of energy when surrounded by boulders! Wrooooar! Coming at you! Let me blow off some steam! 
Whew... Crazy, delicious sugar! I think I’ve calmed down now... 
If it’s called a mountain, you can be sure I’ll be climbing it. Even if it’s a mountain of food, I’ll still be stickin’ my flag on top! 
When you’re up in the mountains, a battle’d do for a proper greeting! 
Yahoo! 
Actually, when you’re up in the mountains, a simple hi’d do if you walk past someone. Oh, and this isn’t the mountains. 
May we have a battle, please? It will be something to lighten up this boring picnic with. 
We’re not going to win if we play around like that... 
I’m going home to play with my Pokémon! 
The working-class hero says hi! 
The working-class hero waves bye... 
I used to work here a long time ago, before it shut down. I worked at the ironworks near Floaroma Town, too. You might say I’m drawn by iron as if by magnet! 
While I’m making sure the lifts are safe, I’ll focus on a battle with you! 
A-OK! Looks safe to me! Not a problem in sight! 
I routinely check the lifts here. You can be sure of their safety! 
Hey! This is no playground! If you’re gonna play, battle me! 
You played me like an amateur! 
They were going to close this place up so no one could get in. But, they left it open so people and Pokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place as their training grounds. 
Maybe I should head to the Gym and work out there... 
Roark spent his childhood playing here, I think... 
Humph! You’re lost, aren’t you? I’ll guide you if you can beat me. 
You didn’t really have to win! I’m not going to guide you now! 
I’m not lost, I tell you! I’m camping! That’s my story! 
Huh? Are you lost too? No? It doesn’t matter. Let’s have a quick Pokémon battle! 
Lost? There’s nothing lost about this kid! 
I got separated from my friends... I’ve got my Pokémon with me, so I’m OK, but... 
You look like you might just have the Pokémon I’ve been looking for! 
You didn’t have a single Pokémon I wanted... You’re no Collector! 
I’m very picky, so I want to collect every Pokémon without anyone’s help. ...I do have friends, though. No, seriously! I do! 
In deep tunnels and caves, there’re a couple things you’re sure to see. ZUBAT and Ruin Maniacs! 
Your awesome power... It’s mystifying. 
I’ve scoured every inch of this place... Most of it while I was lost. Anyway, if there’s one thing I can say, this place can’t be called ruins! 
Hush now, lost little Pokémon, don’t you cry. I’m here to take care of you! 
Sniffle... W-who’s crying now? 
Speaking of crying, I’m positive I heard crying from deeper in the cave. 
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave! 
I strayed from the battle plan! 
Me? No, I’m not lost. I live here! 
Wandering around, I got hungry, so I ate some wild mushrooms... They gave me gas, and now I can’t stop burping! Bluurrf! 
Bleff! Hurk! I think...I’m getting better... 
I hear there’s a Pokémon that has mushrooms growing on its back. Not around here, somewhere far away. I wonder if they taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you? Are you a Pokémon Trainer? 
OK, so we’re both Trainers. That’s a start, right? 
I just wanted to have a picnic under the Cycling Road. I didn’t think I would get lost in a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a cute setting, good food, and a fun battle! 
That wasn’t any fun for me! 
Why have a picnic here? I don’t know. There’s no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too? Wanna play battle with me? 
You were just toying with me!
I’m playing hide-and-seek here. I like some underground tag, too. 
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon will see through your weaknesses! 
Don’t you have an Achilles’ heel?
I want to become stronger, but only with my favorite Pokémon. 
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon is the shortcut to getting tough. 
I lost? But how is that possible?! 
Getting the best out of any Pokémon... That’s what makes a good Trainer... 
When Trainers lock eyes... That’s right! It’s time to let their Pokémon go wild! 
Your Pokémon have a real peppy feel to them! 
Whether you’re talking to people or Pokémon, it’s important to always look them square in the eyes. 
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of the sweetness that is victory. I can’t afford to lose this one! 
This defeat has the tang of my bitter tears...
I’m sorry, my Pokémon team... I promise, I’ll get better at this so you can get a taste of victory! 
I will win. I am sure of it. Therefore, you will lose! 
But... This isn’t possible! 
It’s not that you’ve won. It’s just that I lost! ...It’s all the same. Go, me. 
Let me see what you got there, kid. I could give you some advice. 
You got way too much! 
Well, I don’t have any advice for someone as tough as you! 
Now we shall battle, and from it will emerge one loser... 
...! 
I can use psychic powers, but battling isn’t so simple... It takes much more to win! 
A battle is a clash of willpower! The one who wants the win the most will emerge the victor! 
But... I thought I could win! 
Psychic power... I know it isn’t easy to believe in something that you can’t see. But love, friendship... You can’t see those, either. 
Allow me to demonstrate how a true Psychic conducts a battle! 
Did I get to show you anything...? Anything at all? 
What can psychic power be used for? Well, one mustn’t use it for committing crimes. But, I don’t use it for doing good, either. Using psychic power leaves me too worn out! 
I see it! I see a victory for me! 
The future...is different! Why?! 
Your efforts have altered the very path of the future! 
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon at the Fighting Dojo in Kanto! 
D  n     i   o  e     n... 
We’re gonna go ahead and leave... You know, go train elsewhere. 
Judo chop! Pokémon battle! 
Wrroar! Judo chop defeated!
I’ll forget that we lost! ...Wait, if I did that, we’d never learn from our mistakes... 
What it means to battle... Its joys, its sorrows... I’ve experienced it all! 
My sorrow deepens... 
You may be a child, but you’ve taught me a whole lot. I thank you humbly. 
I’ll wheel out some wicked Pokémon and even wickeder moves! 
All I can manage now is to wheeze out a few meek sighs... 
I don’t see what my age has to do with playing with Pokémon, frankly. 
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to wherever. And so, here I am! 
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place, and it turns out to be the Battle Zone... 
I was born in the Hoenn region. I’ve only just recently flown here. 
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so, we train here daily! 
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of Mother Nature. They’re tough! 
How could you be tougher than Mother Nature? 
Most of the time, my Pokémon return to their Poké Balls right away. But sometimes, they just fall asleep on top of my head. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be evident in every Trainer! 
See the potential of dragon Pokémon! The Championship is within my sights! 
Potential doesn’t mean I can win... 
A Dragon Tamer Champion... I’ll need to train so much more to even come close to coming close... 
I’ve cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s potential! I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again! 
My Pokémon and I seek only victory! 
Arrrgh! My Pokémon... 
I failed my Pokémon! I wasn’t prepared enough to lead it! I don’t ever want my precious Pokémon to be humiliated again! 
You’ve beaten us once before, but we won’t make the same mistake! 
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings... That’s what my master taught me. And now I’ll prove it to you! 
Not good enough! We’re still not strong enough! 
It’s not good enough for a Pokémon to just be tough. It’s not good enough for a Trainer to just work hard. Both have to grow together!
This time we’ll get it right! Marvel at the exquisite combination of my Pokémon and myself! 
How do you do? I’m Stanley, and I’m a Dragon Tamer. What do you say we let our Pokémon have it out? Sound OK to you? 
Victory! That is, victory for you... 
It seems to me, there’s this certain image that goes with a Dragon Tamer. But me, I’d much sooner take it easy, take it slow, and take it my own way. I figure there’s more than my style that I need to work on first. 
Hey, how do you do again? What do you say we let our Pokémon have at it again? Sound OK to you? 
There is something missing in the way I battle... I’ve come here to find it. 
I see it now... I know what I lack. 
Battling you was an eye-opener. I learned something very important in that short time. 
Have you discovered what’s missing in your battles? I have. 
I’ve got the urge to battle with you. Hope you’re willing to oblige! 
I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge... 
So long as my partner’s alongside me, I’m willing to take on the world! 
The urge to battle you again has struck me. Want to humor me? 
Have you any knowledge of levels or the stats of Pokémon? Well, I do! 
Hmm. I like how you attack. 
Pokémon and numbers... Who cares about that stuff? Winning is what’s important. Numbers aren’t everything. 
Pokémon battles aren’t decided by numbers. It’s the bond you share with your Pokémon that decides outcomes! 
Welcome to my Pokémon show! 
Did you enjoy the show? Super fabulous, wasn’t it? 
I’ll be happy to battle you again! Let’s battle again sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show! 
I’ve pumped up my gang till they can’t get pumped no more. They’re going to school your Pokémon! 
My bunch got schooled, and how! 
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos... You name it, I pumped ’em full of it. 
Hey! You’re that Trainer who schooled me and my Pokémon! OK, this time we’ll return the favor! We’ll be doing the schooling! 
I took great pains raising my partners. I’ll show you how strong I made them! 
It needs to be leveled more?! 
My Pokémon... They’re the first friends I ever caught. They mean everything to me!
...When I close my eyes, I can picture how we lost to you in vivid detail. But, I’ve raised them since then! I’ll throw their strength in your face! 
Worthy opponents... The search for them drives me to travel far. 
I’ve certainly found a tough adversary in you... 
How much you believe in your Pokémon... That’s a critical factor in how a battle will turn out. 
We’ve faced many challengers since we met, but they were all weak... I relish the tough resistance that only you can provide! 
Please don’t hold anything back. 
Hmm... 
I feel invigorated from that battle, even though we lost. After all, we gave it everything we had.
Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back--just like before. 
You’re willing to battle? Let me see what you have? 
Your love of Pokémon really shows! 
I grew up together with Felix and my team, right from my childhood. All our memories, we’ve always shared them. 
Oh, hi, we meet again. May I see what you’ve done with your Pokémon? 
The world is huge, and there are so many different Pokémon! What kinds of Pokémon are with you? Please, I want to have a look! 
Wow, there are Pokémon that wonderful! 
There is always something to like about any Pokémon. It’s so hard to decide which ones I should raise. 
If I’m having trouble deciding, I go with my favorites! 
What sort of moves have you taught? That tells me how good you are! 
Yowch! 
I heard that somewhere there’s someone who teaches Pokémon moves. 
Have you taught your team any new moves since last time? 
When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts! 
You won’t let me win? 
I suddenly remembered what it was  like when I had my first battle. I wonder why that would be? 
When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts! That’s what makes us Trainers! 
You’re going to win! That’s the future I saw! 
What I saw in the future turned out to be true... 
I lost, but my vision of the future came true... 
You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw! 
Right after this, you will send out your Pokémon to do battle! 
After this, I will reluctantly hand over the prize money to you... 
What will you do after this? Why don’t you decide for yourself? It would be much more fun that way! 
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an astonishingly cool way! 
My quest for power brought me here. It was beneath the desert sand that I toughened my body and soul. Accept my challenge! Uraah! 
My spirit is broken... 
I thought I couldn’t win before it became a fact... I’ve let down my Pokémon... They go to battle with faith in their Trainer...
This time! This time I will win! My spirit is renewed and strong! 
I have meditated under a waterfall to temper my spirit. Allow me to demonstrate its strength! 
Ha-choo! Sniffle... 
All that time under the waterfall... Seems I’ve caught a cold. 
Since the day I lost to you, I’ve meditated under a waterfall! 
People! Nature! Pokémon! Harmony is essential! 
You’re A-OK! 
Protecting Pokémon and nature. Think of what that means. 
Do you remember my slogan? People! Nature! Pokémon! That’s right, harmony is essential! 
I work to protect beautiful, natural environments. My Pokémon are my constant companions while I work. 
Oh, my gosh! My poor Pokémon! 
Everyone can do their part to keep nature clean. It doesn’t take much. 
I’m on patrol in pristine nature with my Pokémon like usual. Come to think of it, you’re always with Pokémon, too. 
We go on patrol to make sure there’s nothing strange going on. And occasionally, we battle! 
Thanks much! 
Using the Pokémon ability Pickup for gathering dropped items is a good thing. I think it’s ecological, even. I am cleaning up the environment! 
Patrols day in and day out! And the occasional battle! 
In the embrace of Mother Nature, people and Pokémon grow strong! 
Your Pokémon are so muscular. It makes me sigh seeing them... 
It doesn’t matter where they grow. Pokémon can be made tougher anywhere if you set your mind to it. 
By battling tough opponents, both Trainers and Pokémon grow tough! 
We’ve grown strong together in nature and in the concrete jungle. We make everywhere we go our playground! 
You’re really tough, aren’t you?! 
Look around you at this wildly contorted terrain. It’s no wonder that Pokémon would grow tough in a place like this. 
We’re tough, but we know you’re just as tough! Let’s battle it out to see which one of us is tougher! 
Are you getting worn out from all the running you’ve done? 
You’re not tired at all?! 
The world is full of Pokémon and all sorts of Trainers. 
What do you think of the Battle Zone? You’ve met so many Pokémon... I’ve got to battle you again! 
A Trainer riding a Pokémon! I like that! Let’s battle it out! 
Awesome! You’re a real wild child! 
You ride atop the waves while riding on a Pokémon! And you rode right over me! 
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about a rematch? 
Check out my physique! The rough seas sculpted this awesome body! 
I’ve got a muscular physique, but there’s no strength behind it... 
Seeing a Pokémon use Surf to carry you out on the sea... It strikes an emotional chord with me somewhere deep down. 
The rough seas almost drowned... ...I mean, sculpted this awesome body! Let my chiseled physique inspire you! 
Check out my dynamic form! Victory is assured! 
Oh. That’s how it is. 
Being a good swimmer doesn’t make me any better as a Trainer... 
Hi! You’re that kid who’s great with Pokémon! I’ll battle with an even more dynamic form than before! Watch me now! 
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up and ready to go all out! 
Our muscles are deflating... 
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques! That was our game plan... 
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up! See, our muscles are twitching! 
People keep coming to us for battles. I really don’t know why! Teehee! 
OK, we lost. 
I wanted to be alone, but swatting away immature boys on the prowl... Well, my Pokémon grew tough without me really even trying. 
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?! Leave me alone! 
Are your Pokémon growing properly? 
Maybe too grown up! 
I’ve grown with my Pokémon, too. My swimsuit’s getting a little tight... 
Did your Pokémon grow any more? My Pokémon? Mine are doing awesome! 
I’m a mermaid drifting among the waves... And a high-spirited gal who battles with Pokémon! 
Losing... Makes my tears well up. 
A mermaid’s tears are so salty... 
I’m still a mermaid drifting among the waves... And a high-spirited gal who battles with Pokémon! 
I want to be with my water Pokémon! That’s why I swim! 
Glub glub... I’m sinking... 
I thought that everyone would be all dedicated to training out here. But most people are really laid back. It’s not like what I imagined. I guess being with Pokémon, people get all mellowed out. 
I want to be with water Pokémon! That’s why I’m going to get tougher! 
                                                                 
                    
                                                         
With one mighty flap, my birds blow away the embers of aggression! 
We failed to get off the ground... 
The HM Fly isn’t useful inside caves. It’s such a shame. 
Dragons and a fiery mountain... It’s a totally classic setup! 
Losing isn’t a happy occasion... 
My Pokémon seem to like it here a lot. 
Are you seeking the mythical Pokémon, too? Let’s battle, then! 
There’s nothing left... 
The mythical Pokémon that sleeps deep in a volcano... Could it be a dragon Pokémon? 
What it means to win battles... That is what I seek. Teach me if you will! 
I grow less certain still... 
Perhaps there is no meaning to victory, but still I will battle! That is what makes me a Trainer! 
Let me ask to see if you know. What is time? 
Another memory... In a chain of memories. 
For me, time is the fabric woven by memories, one after another... 
I was born in Floaroma Town. I’m sure thrilled to be here. It took a long time to get here. We’re not going to lose again! 
We went down... We couldn’t stick it out... 
You can level all you want, but that won’t guarantee you any wins. But we keep trying to get better. That’s what makes us Trainers. 
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather here aren’t pushovers. They all have tricks up their sleeves! 
You’re not a Trainer that can be taken lightly! 
The Pokémon you’ll meet here won’t make it easy for you to move onward. 
You’ve come all this way for Pokémon? You must be dedicated. 
Your dedication won out. 
The Pokémon here must battle each other all the time. That must be why they are so strong in this area. 
Can you answer this for me? What is space? 
And another... A new memory was born. 
For me, space is where memories are made... 
I came here after winning my way through the Battle Tower! 
But... I had a win streak going... 
Train more at the Battle Tower... That’s what I’ll do. 
We’re all good to go! We just have to battle now! 
Aww... I’m out of useful items! 
We came completely unprepared for this little adventure... 
I had a revelation this morning. I knew that I would have a wonderful encounter here today. 
There’s nothing wonderful about this! 
Is my sense of premonition nothing to write home about? 
I’ll use my mystifying psychic power to pulverize you! 
That’s what I get for making idle claims... 
Psychic power is a mystery that defies explanation. But if everything could be explained, it would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything. And you think you can win?! 
We weren’t up to the task! 
Even though my team could break bricks and shatter boulders, they failed to dent your spirits! 
Hear the howl of my iron fists! Howdy! I’m crazy for karate! 
Losing made it clear to me. You’re crazy about Pokémon! 
I love seeing people who love Pokémon more than anything! 
What do you expect to achieve here? I’ll be the one to make that call! 
You’ve earned the right to be here. Both you and your Pokémon. 
You may find it odd, but the stink of sulfur from the volcanic gas is what draws me here. 
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                  
                             
                                                          
                                                  
                             
                                   
                                                  
                             
                                                              
                                                  
                             
                                                     
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                          
                              
                                                            
                                                                            
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                                
                              
                                                            
I just got worked over! And by a kid no less... 
...! Again and again... 
It is our mission to stall you. Sorry, but we gotta do our job. 
Losing was a part of my job, too. ...I feel better by saying that. 
From three lakes, we must secure three Pokémon. You simply mustn’t interfere! 
In order for us to bring peace to the world, we must control it! 
You’re too young to understand. 
Our boss always had plans for the three lakes... While you were blissfully ignorant, our work went ahead... 
I’ll knock your Pokémon into orbit! 
My mind is going orbital! 
The Pokémon here has already been taken to our HQ in Veilstone. So, you see? A child like you can’t touch us! 
If this mission is successful, we will get a nice bonus. 
There goes our bonus... This is an epic tragedy... 
I want Team Galactic to become powerful. That is all I want. 
...You, my friend, are tough! I can see why you defy us so... 
We set off the Galactic Bomb! Its blast force was phenomenal! 
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal power... 
But so what? You aim to take us all on? Dream on! Team Galactic is huge in number. Even as we speak, other members should be near Twinleaf Town. That’s right, they’re on the way to Lake Verity! 
I’ll punish you in place of our boss for defying Team Galactic! 
Grr... I took the punishment... 
We’re Team Galactic! The no. 1 syndicate in the world! To defy us is to defy the universe! 
...Would you like to join the MAGIKARP and flop around in the mud? 
...Overwhelming! 
I played you for a child, and paid a stiff price for my arrogance... However, you’re much too late. Team Galactic has already found the sunken island under the lake. And the Pokémon that lay in it? Well, what do you think? 
You’re tough, kid! But, I still pity the likes of you. 
Well, what have we here? A Trainer who’s lost their way? 
You’re lost but you won! That burns me up to eleven! 
You barged right into our HQ? You must not know what fear is, kid! 
What with that creepy Charon and a kid like you around, the HQ’s not the same anymore. Like, you characters changed the, well, character of the place! 
Oh, sure. Why don’t you just get all cocky about it! 
Without our special card key, you’re not going to get very far. Well, non-Team Galactic member? What’s your next move? 
Who do you think you are? Desecrating the halls of our HQ?! 
A tough little Trainer is what you are... 
In our HQ, we get around by taking warp panels. I’d like to see you figure out how they connect. 
You’re too young to understand the changing times! Stand aside and let Team Galactic shape the future! 
I failed to read the flow of battle, and your power was unfathomable... 
Come on, I said something cool before the battle. You need to read the dramatic situation better here! 
I’m, like, this close to getting my promotion to Commander. I’ll impress our great boss by making you my newest trophy! 
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one... I’ll probably get busted down to the gruntiest of the grunts... Humph!
                           
                
                                
                            
                        
                                                        
Intruder alert! There’s something smelly about you! 
Oh, it was my own Pokémon’s smell... 
How could we arouse suspicion? We’re Team Galactic, and this is our HQ! 
Having fun scampering around our HQ, you sneaky intruder? Your trail blazing will go out in a blaze of glory right now! 
Your trailblazing streak lives on! 
So what, you have momentum... It’s too late. The experiment’s done! 
You should be tired out by now. It’s Team Galactic’s turn to shine! 
What? I don’t get it. What’s your rush? 
Pokémon are that important to you? Is that what this is all about? 
Are you enjoying your unescorted, unauthorized, and unsettling tour of Team Galactic HQ? 
Let me do what I want! 
It doesn’t matter what happens to the Team Galactic HQ building. Soon, all will belong to Team Galactic, anyway! 
Hey there, little Trainer! You’re famous among Team Galactic. The order has been issued--we get a promotion if we put you down! 
I just blew my promotion... 
What’s so special about you anyway? You’re just like any other little kid Trainer you can find anywhere!
Our time has come! It’s Team Galactic’s time now! 
When’s it gonna be my turn... 
It’s too late! No amount of desperation from a kid like you will make a difference! 
Our time is coming! A time for us alone! We’ll send you back in time. A time before you started training! 
Gyah! 
You can struggle all you want, but you can’t stop Team Galactic alone! It doesn’t matter how many Pokémon you try to use as your tools! 
Team Galactic is all powerful! Only a fool would show defiance to the mighty might of Team Galactic! 
Not standing up to the mighty is foolish, you say... 
It doesn’t matter if you’re an adult or a kid if you have Pokémon... Pokémon are the equalizers. I should have realized sooner...
I can’t believe you chased me here... OK, let’s see how tough you are. 
Where do you get that power?! 
Mt. Coronet... I might be just a grunt, but even I can tell it has a weird energy! 
This is our final operation. No one will interfere! 
You turned the tables on me... I call interference... 
The closer you are to the peak, the closer you are to space! Soon, Team Galactic will... Uh... Team Galactic will achieve greatness! 
Team Galactic will take control of everything! You can try all you want, but you can’t do anything alone! 
All you gave me was the taste of defeat... 
...Is our boss about to ditch us and claim everything for himself?
We Grunts have two jobs. One, ensure the success of our operation at the summit. Two, utterly destroy any intruders to stop their meddling! 
I don’t accept this! I will not accept this! 
Join Team Galactic and then abide by our rules. That would solve all our problems! 
Say, listen, do you realize you’re breaking hearts by being successful? It’s your fault that Team Galactic members are in so much pain... 
See? You’ve left me brokenhearted, too... 
Someone’s joy is another person’s sorrow... Everyone be happy and laughing? How ridiculous! Team Galactic should be doing all the laughing! 
...Our boss is going to do something huge at the summit. But here I am dealing with some pesky intruder. You’re spoiling the atmosphere. You can lose quickly, right? 
You’re not supposed to work me over like that. 
All my excitement’s gone now... This whole Mt. Coronet trip is too rough, long, and draining... 
You’ve worked so hard to get here. You should be proud of yourself! And now, I’ll send you packing home with only that happy thought! 
Wh-- How dare you! That’s how you respond to my generosity? 
We couldn’t stop you... We’ll be discarded as useless... Our boss is ruthless that way... 
Oh, yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too! 
What the?! We’re in trouble?! But there’s no giving up on me! 
What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?! 
Oh, yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too!

We’ve gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty of times before! 
We’re not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon have given up!

I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason to freak out. 
We’re not finished yet! We’ll get out of this spot because we’re so tight! 
What just went down?! My team still needs raising?!

It’s not over yet! A League Elite Four cannot give up! 
I will now concede defeat. But I think you came to see how great Bug-type Pokémon can be. I hope you also realized what you’re up against in the Pokémon League. Battling is a deep and complex affair... 
Dear child, don’t assume for an instant that you’ve won. 
Well! Dear child, I must say, that was most impressive. Your Pokémon believed in you and did their best to earn you the win. Even though I’ve lost, I find myself with this silly grin! 
I can feel your determination. Your will is overpowering me! 
This situation... This is heating up! I’m blazing now! 
...! I don’t believe it! I lost! I didn’t take you for granted... But I didn’t expect you to win! I’d never even considered it! I’m blown away by this! You and your Pokémon are hot stuff! 
Hmm... Now what should I do... 
I see... You getting past the three before me was no fluke. Your power is real. 
I can’t remember the last time I was put in a corner like this! 
I won’t let this end yet! This match is too fun to let it end this easily! 
...Just a few minutes ago, you were the most powerful challenger. And just now, you became the most powerful of all the Trainers. You are now our newest Champion! 
You got Pokémon! I got Pokémon! Let’s see whose Pokémon is the best! 
I give up! You’re too much! Are you maybe a Pokémon genius? 
Making Pokémon battle each other makes them tougher, you know? 
Hi, what kinds of Pokémon do you have with you? I’ll show you my Pokémon while we have a battle. 
Huh? It’s over already?! I thought I’d win for sure! 
You’re too tough! I won’t battle you again! Just joking! I’ll challenge you again when I level up my Pokémon. 
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, and so am I. When Trainers lock eyes, that means a battle is on! 
Losing makes me mad, but that was still a bunch of fun!
With Pokémon that tough, I bet you could go anywhere in Sinnoh!

Your heart burns as hot as mine! 
This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve trained since then! 
Whew... You’re overtrained for me. 
I knew you were headed back here. I felt it with the soles of my feet!

Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn’t help! 
Gwaaah! This is hurting! 
Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again! Our rhythm of battle! 
Can you hear it? That’s my guitar weeping... 
Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to show you my skill. This time, I’ll shows you why they consider me an ace! 
I’m burning with jealousy over your talent! 
Ace Trainers always work to improve their natural-born talents. 
I see... I have to concede defeat. 
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of Pokémon you can see there? 
You’re one enthusiastic Trainer. 
Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve battled before, haven’t we? 
You sure showed me up. 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. You sing, too! 
Your Pokémon... They’re looking good!

I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the Pokémon League. 
I’m shocked... No, really. 
I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m challenging the Pokémon League! 
Blblblblugh... 
It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have toughened me up! 
The world remains as harsh as ever... 
It doesn’t matter how long it takes, I’m going to the Pokémon League! 
Th-this is so hard... 
How much stronger did your Pokémon become? Let me check for you, OK? 
I’ve had my fill... 
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to become powerful. 
Your battle style... 
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to know what all this means! 
I see... So that’s what it was... 
See? You’ve come back again. There must be something that draws you here... 
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather marvelous... 
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an excuse to slack off. I take pride in challenging those who have bested me before! 
I see... Simply outstanding.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so, we train here daily! 
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out to be the Battle Zone... 
I’ve cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s abilities! I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again! 
Raising abilities alone doesn’t mean I can win either... 
What’s missing from my game... Have you discovered yours yet? 
I see it now... 
The urge to battle you again has struck me. Humor me! 
I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge... 
We’ve faced many challengers since we met, but they were all weak... I relish the tough resistance that only you can provide! 
I’ve found a tough adversary in you... 
Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back, just like before. 
Hmm... 
You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw! 
What I saw in the future turned out to be true... 
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an astonishingly cool manner! 
Right after this, I have to pay out your prize money... 
This time! This time I will win! My spirit is renewed and strong! 
My spirit is broken... 
Do you remember my slogan? People! Nature! Pokémon! That’s right. Harmony is essential! 
You’re A-OK! 
By battling tough opponents, both people and Pokémon grow tough! 
My, you are tough. 
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about a rematch? 
Awesome! You’re a real wild child! 
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?! 
OK, we lost. 
                                                    
                                 
Does this mean I’m only talented as an Artist? 
You’re a lucky one... 
I never thought I’d lose at Papa’s restaurant... 
Ohh... How could I lose at dear Papa’s restaurant? 
Ack! I lost... Check, please!  
So young, and yet so strong! How very remarkable!
I don’t care if I lose. I’m still a happy guy. 
Waaah! You’re too much! 
Wow... You’re out there. 
No one’s hurt? 
Tough, aren’t you...? 
I was with my daddy, too... 
That’s quite the demonstration. 
Hmm... I should have expected this.
My luck’s run out... 
I think I have what it takes to become a successful model! 
Hmm... I failed to foresee this outcome... 
You know, I had confidence before heading into this. 
Yeah, like I’m really supposed to win with a Pokémon like this...
We spend all our time battling in the blizzards of Snowpoint City. We’ll show you how it’s toughened us up! 
What’s with your toughness?! 
You’ve battled all over, you say? That makes you tough, perhaps. 
I’ve only been involved with Pokémon for a short time. I managed to get this far because skilled friends toughened me up! 
I can’t believe how tough you are! 
If you have wonderful friends, there is no limit to how far you can go. 
Our mission is to implement our operations without question. It is all for the new world order that our boss will lead! 
This won’t go unpunished... 
I’m willing to do anything to get ahead in Team Galactic. One day you’ll see what we are all about. It’s wonder, compassion, splendor, humor, power, awe, and tragedy! 
I won’t let you disrupt our research! This is for Team Galactic! 
I got whipped... I look pathetic... 
Our boss is a scientific genius! He will make the power of mythical Pokémon his own! 
Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the- art facility! A snot-nosed kid like you ought to keep your dirty hands to yourself! 
You and your Pokémon weren’t part of my calculations... 
Our boss is trying to create an entirely new world. A world only for us! For Team Galactic! 
Bika bikabika! Pigachu! 
Pikachu... 
Pika... I’ll need a lot more practice to become a real PIKACHU... 
I work in the fiery foundry. You bet I’m hot and sweaty! 
I burned out... 
I toughened up my muscles from honest work. Pokémon have nothing on me! 
Well! It’s not often we get a visitor like you to the ironworks! Let’s mark the occasion with a battle! 
Fire! And once more, only because I feel like it, fiyaaaah! 
The floor panels move automatically. We’re pretty proud of them here! 
Are you maybe getting annoyed by where the floor panels take you? 
I’m going down in flames! 
The sweat of a working man is beautiful to behold... There is also beauty in the tears wept from defeat... 
The toughest of all the grunts! That was me... 
Arrgh! I let some little kid beat me! 
Sheesh... I should have done the fighting myself. 
Humph! You’ve toughened up. But you’re no match for our boss. 
Done in by two kids?! This isn’t right! 
I should have kept my head down and just watched our warehouse... 
Fweh... If I didn’t run... I could’ve...battled harder... 
My last Pokémon. 
I see... I may lose if this pace continues... 
Interesting. And quite curious. 
I admit that you have pushed me to this extreme. 
This... This cannot be! It’s not possible that I lose! 
I won’t accept this! This can’t be! Not after all the sacrifices we’ve made to get this far! What of my new world?! Of my new galaxy?! Was this all a dream to be swept away by your reality?! 
I want to cry... My heart is shattered... 
They’re too tough to handle! What a combination! 
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough, my Pokémon get tougher! 
What just went down?! You’re telling me I lost again?! 
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough, my Pokémon get tougher! 
What just went down?! You’re telling me I lost again?! 
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough, my Pokémon get tougher! 
What just went down?! You’re telling me I lost again?! 
I’m not giving up till the end! I can’t give up! 
What just went down?! You wait! I’ll get tougher! 
I’m not giving up till the end! I can’t give up! 
What just went down?! You wait! I’ll get tougher! 
I’m not giving up till the end! I can’t give up! 
What just went down?! You wait! I’ll get tougher! 
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace? 
My pace is completely off... 
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace? 
My pace is completely off... 
What in the...?! That one hurt, you! 
No way! We can keep going! This is where we hit our stride! 
What are you saying?! We ended up losing?!

Impressive. Your prowess is notable. 
Ouch! Are you one of those loyal fans? You sure are rowdy!

You’re so strong!
You’re so strong!! 
You’re so strong!!! 
You’re so strong!!!! 
You’re so strong!!!!! 
Too much for me! 
Oh, dear me! 
Your toughness is something else. We were completely overwhelmed! 
... 
No way! Not yet! Not giving up! 
W-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon! 
Are you saying something? You think you have me cornered? 
Amazing! You’re very good, aren’t you? 
If we turn it around here, the spectators will be stoked! 
That puts a grin on my face! Guhahaha! That was a blast! 
This is like back at the Gym, isn’t it? I’m in a bit of a bind, aren’t I? 
I’m forced to admit defeat again... You are much too strong. 
It is too difficult, but... Never give up, never surrender! 
You are so fantastically strong. I know why I have lost. 
Not yet! You can’t break our will! 
You’re mighty! You’re worthy of lots of respect. 
We’re not done yet! There’s no giving up! 
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon--defeated! 
You methodically corner me! Just like before! 
I even felt thrilled during our match. That was a very good battle. 
I can’t keep up with healing... 
Striking the right balance of offense and defense... It’s not easy to do. 
Your team! I sense your strong aura! 
At times we battle, and sometimes we team up... It’s great how Trainers can interact. 
...My time with you is drawing to a close... 
...Awww. 
Now this! This is a smoking-hot situation! 
Heeheehee! So hot, you! 
Oh, no! You’re too much for me! 
Mira wonders if she can get very far in the Battle Tower. 
What’s with you?! Do you have a vendetta against me?! 
Humph! Quit flaunting your toughness! It’s not cute in the least! 
Oh, dear... The trouble with fun is that it is over so quickly. 
Wow! You’re out of this world! 
You are good, you! My Pokémon, they have enjoyed it, too! 
My Pokémon can’t be faulted with anything. Your brilliance carried the day. 
It’s not over yet! A League Elite Four can’t give up! 
I will now concede defeat. But I think you came to see how great Bug-type Pokémon can be. I hope you also realized what you’re up against in the Pokémon League. Battling is a deep and complex affair... 
Dear child, don’t assume for an instant that you’ve won. 
Well! Dear child, I must say, that was most impressive. Your Pokémon believed in you and did their best to earn you the win. Even though I’ve lost, I find myself with this silly grin! 
I can feel your determination. Your will is overpowering me! 
This situation... This is heating up! I’m blazing now! 
...! I don’t believe it! I lost! I didn’t take you for granted... But I never expected you to win! I’d never even considered it! I’m blown away by this! You and your Pokémon are hot stuff! 
Hmm... Now what should I do... 
I see... Your getting past the three before me was no fluke. Your power is real. 
I can’t remember the last time I was put in a corner like this! 
I won’t let this end yet! This match is too fun to let it end this easily! 
...Just a few minutes ago, you were the most powerful challenger. And just now, you became the most powerful of all the Trainers. You are now our newest Champion! 
No way! I won’t give up! There’s never any giving up!
What was that about?! I’m going to get tougher, though! Tougher with these guys! 
No way! I won’t give up! There’s never any giving up!

The press is the victim!

[VAR(284, 2, 0)][VAR(513, 15)] This is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Is there something that you wanted to do?
Whoops! Sorry, but I have to do something else. Another time, OK?
Do you want to do anything else?
... ... The Trainer appears to be busy...
                       
Sure thing! As my “Greetings,” here’s my Trainer Case.
Huh? My Trainer Case... Where’d it go now? Sorry! I’ll show you another time!
I’m just showing my Trainer Case as my way of a greeting.
I hope I get to know you better!
Oh, did you want to draw with me? Sure thing, but wait just a second.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s get drawing!
Oh, sorry! I can’t now. Let’s draw another time.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We’re drawing right now. Oh, I know! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], would you like to draw with us?
Oh, all right. Come see me anytime, OK?
OK! Let’s do some drawing together!
                                          
The last letter of what you draw has to be the first letter of what I draw?
Stop drawing funny faces! It hurts to laugh so much!
Wow, you’re good! I’ll try to imitate you!
...Uh-huh... What is that? That’s supposed to be me?
A battle? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s get our battle started!
Sorry! My Pokémon don’t seem to be feeling too well right now. Let me battle you another time.
If you want to battle, you need two Pokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower. 
Whoa! I can tell you’re pretty tough!
You used that move? That’s good strategy!
Way to go! That was an eye-opener!
Oh! How could you use that Pokémon in that situation?
You want to trade, huh? Sure, hold on just a second.
All right! Let’s trade!
Sorry! I don’t have a Pokémon I can trade right now. Let’s trade some other time.
Oh yeah! I really wanted this Pokémon!
Finally, I got that Pokémon I’ve wanted for such a long time.
You can’t trade if you have only one Pokémon with you. 
If you want to do something with me, just give me a shout!
You want to mix records with me? OK, I just need a little time.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s mix our records, then.
Oh, I’m sorry. I have too much to do right now. Another time, OK?
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We’re going to mix our records now. I know! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], do you want to mix your records with us, too?
Oh, all right. Come see me anytime, OK?
OK! Let’s mix our records!
Oh, sorry! I just can’t right this instant. Another time, OK?
It’s fun mixing records!
I’m going to mix records with everyone!
Mix it up! Keep mixing!
You should mix records, too!
Spin Trade? Sure! OK, just hold on a second!
OK, all set! Let’s do a Spin Trade!
Oh! Sorry! I can’t right now. Please ask me another time!
You need an Egg if you want to take part in a Spin Trade. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We’re going to do a Spin Trade now. Hey, [VAR(259, 1, 0)]! Do you want to join us for a Spin Trade, too?
Oh, OK. Come see us anytime!

There is an Egg that cannot be traded in your party.
Spin Trades are so much fun!
There! Stop there!
My Egg’s awesome!
Yes! I got the Egg I wanted!
[VAR(284, 2, 0)][VAR(513, 15)] Hello, it’s [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Would you like to do something?
Whoops! Sorry, but I have to do something else. Another time, OK?
Want to do something else?
... ... The Trainer appears to be busy...
                       
As my introduction, I’ll show you my Trainer Case.
Oh? Now where did I put my Trainer Case...? Sorry! I’ll show you later!
We’re showing each other our Trainer Cases to get acquainted.
Glad to meet you. Please don’t be a stranger!
You want to draw with me? Sure! Just give me a second...
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
Oh, I’m sorry! Let’s draw another time!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We were drawing right now. Oh, I know! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], would you like to draw with us?
Oh... Please come by anytime.
OK! Thanks for waiting! Let’s get drawing!
Sorry! I just can’t right now! Let’s draw some other time.
Wow! You’re really good!
Ahaha! What is that?!
I love drawing! I can draw and draw!
Oops! I can’t stay inside the lines!
A battle? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
I’m terribly sorry, but my Pokémon aren’t feeling well... Let’s battle another time.
If you want to battle, you need two Pokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower. 
That Pokémon... It’s been raised really well!
That’s it! This is the right move now!
That’s awesome! You can battle that way?
You have exquisite timing for switching Pokémon!
A trade? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
I’m sorry, but I don’t have any Pokémon that I can trade now... Let’s trade some other time!
I’m trading Pokémon right now.
I finally got that Pokémon I wanted in a trade!
You can’t trade if you have only one Pokémon with you. 
If you want to do something with me, don’t be shy. Just ask!
You want to mix records? Sure! But I need a little time!
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
Oh, sorry! Let’s do this another time!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We were just mixing our records. I know! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], would you like to mix your records with us, too?
Oh... Please come by anytime.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s mix some records!
Oh, sorry! Let’s do this another time!
It’s so fun to mix records!
I’m going to keep mixing!
Let’s mix it up!
I wonder what’s going to happen?
Spin Trade? Of course! OK, can you just wait a moment?
OK, all ready! Let’s get this Spin Trade started!
Oh! Sorry! Let’s do this another time!
If you want to join a Spin Trade, you need to bring an Egg, too. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We were doing Spin Trades just now. [VAR(259, 1, 0)], do you want to join us and do some Spin Trades, too?
Oh, OK. Come see us anytime!
OK! Let’s do a Spin Trade together!
                                             
                     
There is an Egg that cannot be traded in your party.
We’re doing Spin Trades!
Wah! It moved again!
There goes the Egg I wanted...
If it stopped there, I would’ve gotten a Berry.
Welcome to the Union Room. If there is anything you need help with, please let me know!
How may I help you?
Which topic would you like me to explain?
In the Union Room, you may battle with two Pokémon of your choice that are Lv. 30 or lower. When you visit here, we recommend that you bring Pokémon that meet this requirement. 
You may trade your Pokémon with other players. Meeting new people could be a shortcut to meeting rare Pokémon! 
You may communicate with other players and mix your records. What will happen if you mix records, you ask? We recommend that you try it and see! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
In a Spin Trade, participants each bring an Egg for trading with others. Which Egg will you end up with? What kind of Pokémon is in that Egg? It’s quite exciting and fun! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
You may get together with others and draw. You all get to work on one sheet of paper at the same time. I’m sure a drawing made by friends will be a memorable masterpiece! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
You can chat with other people by selecting “CHAT” in the menu. Go out and meet other players in the Union Room! Let people know what you’re like and what you’d like to do. Mingle, chat, and add to your circle of friends! 
Oh! Here comes someone now! Instead of me, why not strike up a chat with our newcomer? 
It’s rather boring if no one comes to visit... What might we do for entertainment...? 
Do you sometimes get mistaken for a real [VAR(270, 0, 0)]? I just seem to get that feeling from you. 
Hello! That’s right! It’s important to say a greeting! If someone arrives, let’s try to be friendly! 
Greetings! [VAR(284, 0, 0)]? It’s wonderful! I really like it, too! When you meet someone for the first time, the proper etiquette is to introduce yourself. By introducing yourself, you’ll get to know about the other person, too! 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)] Trainer? That’s what you are? Isn’t that something! But I’m sorry to say, I don’t have any Pokémon... I would rather watch than battle, you see. 
Oh! Your [VAR(284, 0, 0)]! I would love to have it! Please trade me! ... I was actually joking. I don’t have any Pokémon, so I can’t trade with anyone... 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? I can understand you’d want one... But you shouldn’t expect people to make trades just for you. You also have to consider what Pokémon the other person wants. 
Welcome to the Union Room! I’m the only one here now, but please do bring your friends for some fun and excitement! If you have time on your hands, I’m also here to chat. You see, I have a lot of time on my hands... 
I’m quite good at drawing! If it’s [VAR(284, 0, 0)], leave it to me! No one’s better than me at it! 
Oh, you’re leaving... ... It makes me feel lonesome... Please do come visit again! 
What’s wrong? Are you feeling down about something? If you’re feeling blue, it’s much better to have fun with friends than to be alone. 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? Yes, please! ...I do want to join in, but I’m on duty here, so I can’t... Sigh... [VAR(284, 0, 0)]... I wish I could... 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? Me, too, please! But I need to stay here and attend to our visitors... Please enjoy it with your friends! 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? You’re inviting me? Oh, but I have to stay here and attend to our visitors. I’m sorry. I’d love to accept, but I really can’t. 
That’s right! Sometimes, it might be better to just go and invite other people. But don’t get too selfish or pushy because you want to [VAR(284, 0, 0)]. 
Yes! It’s OK! Nothing is impossible. Think positively and keep your chin up! 
Everyone has at least one thing they aren’t good at. You should never try to make someone do what they don’t want to do. Incidentally, [VAR(284, 0, 0)] is something that I would like to do. 
Good luck! I hope you enjoy serious battles. You can’t experience ones like this in the Union Room! 
You want to chat? Well, you shouldn’t be wasting your time chatting with me. You need to be more active and talk to other players. After all, you can’t make friends if you don’t talk to people. 
Where are you? Um... Right before my eyes. Oh! Are you maybe an impostor? The real player is somewhere else? ...That’s ridiculous! Please, don’t be silly! My word! 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)] trade? That sounds fun! I would love to as well. But telling me that won’t help. I can’t trade with anyone. 
If you want to have a [VAR(284, 0, 0)] Battle, you need to be more assertive and talk to other players. If you can’t assert yourself, you may never get a chance at a [VAR(284, 0, 0)] Battle!

This is a giant underground network of passages underneath Sinnoh. Huh? What am I doing down in this expanse of a place? That’s kind of hard to answer. I mean, you can do pretty much anything you want down here. For instance, you can dig up Treasure, Spheres, and make a Secret Base. You can play with your friends down here, too. You should talk to the Underground Man in Eterna City. I have to get going now. I’ll see you around!

Hey, konnichiwa! Glad to meet you, guten tag! I’m the Meister. In this language’s parlance I would be called a craftsman. Something like that, n’est ce pas? Comprendo? 
So, sniff, sniff, I smell you! I smell something about you! There is no question! You are a lover of Pokémon just like me! This is wunderbar! So, this is what I will do. I will power up your Pokédex so you can read the descriptions of Pokémon in other languages! Je suis desolee, but not for all Pokémon, however. Only the Pokémon of countries I, the Meister, have visited. Now, may I see your Pokédex? So, I change this setting here... Fool with this here... And done! Now, you may read the descriptions of the Meister’s Pokémon favorites in other languages. How uber!
Hey, konnichiwa! Bonjour and all the rest! Have you a Pokémon named FINNEON? C’est un Pokémon fish-style? If you will be so kind, trade it will you for my precious MAGIKARP?
Danke schon, arigato, gracias, and what-have-you! That MAGIKARP, it accompanied me from the country of my birth. Be good to it, I beseech you!
Oh, non, non! That is no FINNEON! What I want is a FINNEON! You have made the Meister melancholy!
Oh! This is a tragedy! A tragedy, I tell you! But one day, you will trade me the Pokémon I want! The Meister knows this because I have traveled the world!
Because there are Pokémon, I can make friends anywhere in the world. It so inspires me knowing that. It’s so wonderful in a wonderful way!
There is something scribbled on this notice. “The world-traveling Meister has visited over 150 countries! “But the world remains as big as ever!”

There is a giant globe located near the entrance of the Wi-Fi Plaza. The globe, named Visitor Profiles, shows the locations and the local times of visitors to the Wi-Fi Plaza. To see the visitors, check the panel that appears by pressing the A Button. You should also check the balloons that occasionally float by. 
Plaza News is an electronic display that shows occurrences in the Wi-Fi Plaza. If you’re unsure of what to do, please check the Plaza News. 
The Footprint Stamp is a panel where you can play with the footprints of the Pokémon in your party. There are two panels, black and white. Play with whichever one you want. 
                                                                          
We hope you’ll enjoy yourself in the Wi-Fi Plaza before your time is up. 
Tap Toys are toys that you can play with only in the Wi-Fi Plaza. Besides playing with them on your own, you can also share Tap Toys with friends. The Tap Toys can be powered up playing Plaza Games, too. We hope you’ll come up with your own ways of enjoying them!

===============================
For some time after its birth, it grows by gaining nourishment from the seed on its back.
When the bud on its back starts swelling, a sweet aroma wafts to indicate the flower’s coming bloom.
After a rainy day, the flower on its back smells stronger. The scent attracts other Pokémon.
The fire on the tip of its tail is a measure of its life. If healthy, its tail burns intensely.
In the rocky mountains where CHARMELEON live, their fiery tails shine at night like stars.
It is said that CHARIZARD’s fire burns hotter if it has experienced harsh battles.
It shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity.
It is said to live 10,000 years. Its furry tail is popular as a symbol of longevity.
The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.
It releases a stench from its red antenna to repel enemies. It grows by molting repeatedly.
A steel-hard shell protects its tender body. It quietly endures hardships while awaiting evolution.
It loves the honey of flowers and can locate flower patches that have even tiny amounts of pollen.
It eats its weight in leaves every day. It fends off attackers with the needle on its head.
While awaiting evolution, it hides from predators under leaves and in nooks of branches.
Its best attack involves flying around at high speed, striking with poison needles, then flying off.
It is docile and prefers to avoid conflict. If disturbed, however, it can ferociously strike back.
It flies over its wide territory in search of prey, downing it with its highly developed claws.
By flapping its wings with all its might, PIDGEOT can make a gust of wind capable of bending tall trees.
Cautious in the extreme, its hardy vitality lets it live in any kind of environment.
It whittles its constantly growing fangs by gnawing on hard things. It can chew apart cinder walls.
It flaps its small wings busily to fly. Using its beak, it searches in grass for prey.
It has the stamina to fly all day on its broad wings. It fights by using its sharp beak.
It sneaks through grass without making a sound and strikes unsuspecting prey from behind.
The pattern on its belly is for intimidation. It constricts foes while they are frozen in fear.
It lives in forests with others. It stores electricity in the pouches on its cheeks.
It turns aggressive if it has too much electricity in its body. It discharges power through its tail.
To protect itself from attackers, it curls up into a ball. It lives in arid regions with minimal rainfall.
It curls up, then rolls into foes with its back. Its sharp spines inflict severe damage.
While it does not prefer to fight, even one drop of the poison it secretes from barbs can be fatal.
When it senses danger, it raises all the barbs on its body. These barbs grow slower than NIDORINO’s.
Its entire body is armored with hard scales. It will protect the young in its burrow with its life.
It scans its surroundings by raising its ears out of the grass. Its toxic horn is for protection.
It has a violent disposition and stabs foes with its horn, which oozes poison upon impact.
One swing of its mighty tail can snap a telephone pole as if it were a matchstick.
Thought to live with others on quiet mountains, it is popular for its adorable nature.
