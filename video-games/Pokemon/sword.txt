Route 2
Trainer Tips Pokémon can gain Exp. Points by battling other Pokémon. Exp. Points help them grow stronger. And your Pokémon will still get Exp. Points even if you catch a Pokémon you are battling against!
Trainer Tips Trying to take another person’s Pokémon makes you no different than a thief! Poké Balls are only to be used to try to catch wild Pokémon that have no Trainers!
The Pokémon Nursery You’ve found the right place to come to for all your Pokémon Egg finding needs.
Welcome to the city of Motostoke An industrial city studded with steam-powered marvels of modern engineering.

[~ 11]
Galar Mine lies ahead

Trainer Tips A Pokémon’s moves can be physical moves or special moves. A high Attack stat makes physical moves deal more damage, and a high Sp. Atk stat makes special moves deal more damage!

Trainer Tips Pokémon that appear to be surrounded by a brilliant aura tend to be stronger than others. And when you defeat them, they drop Watts! It seems you become more likely to spot these Brilliant Pokémon the more Pokémon you catch!

Welcome to the ancient city of Hammerlocke A city of great history, living and thriving within castle walls that date back to the middle ages.
Route 6
Trainer Tips You can use each Technical Machine, or TM, as many times as you like on your Pokémon. Teach your Pokémon moves of various types to give them an advantage against all kinds of different opponents in battle! Technical Records, or TRs, can only be used one time before they break, however. Be more thoughtful when choosing to use them!
Welcome to the town of Stow-on-Side A vibrant town that has grown up around an ancient mural tucked away in the mountains.

Trainer Tips If you want to stop a Pokémon from evolving, press the B Button while it’s trying to evolve. The Pokémon will be startled and stop evolving. This trick is called an Evolution cancel!
Welcome to the town of Circhester Buildings from an age long gone still stand about the steaming hot spring that covers the town.
Trainer Tips The Pokémon species you see recommended in your Pokédex will be updated once you manage to catch them all or when the date changes.
Circhester Stadium
Route 8
Trainer Tips Checking out glowing Pokémon Dens in the Wild Area will help you store up Watts! If you climbed all the way up here, you’re likely the sort to investigate every nook and cranny. So keep that curiosity alive to search out every last den as you run around the Wild Area, too!
Welcome to the town of Spikemuth This rocking town has a punk vibe and streets crammed with shops lined up cheek by jowl.
Route 9
↑ Route 9 → Spikemuth
Circhester Bay
↓ Spikemuth
Trainer Tips There are times when you throw a Poké Ball to catch a Pokémon, and it shakes just once. The more Pokémon you catch, the more likely this curious phenomenon is to occur. Since it makes it more likely you’ll be able to catch your target, it’s called a critical catch.
Route 10
Trainer Tips The Dynamax phenomenon is caused by a special power that originates from within Pokémon, warping the space around them and making them appear far larger than they truly are. Some Pokémon also change appearance upon Dynamaxing. This particular kind of Dynamaxing is also known as Gigantamaxing.
Welcome to the modern city of Wyndon This booming metropolis was designed and developed by our very own Chairman Rose.

Is the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color what you want?
Actually, never mind
Jolly good. Jolly good indeed! You’ve picked a wonderful color!
Hold on now. That’s the same color it is now! I’d hardly call that a color change!

Do you want to withdraw from the rally?

No
Oh, you want to withdraw? Of course! I hope you come back for another attempt!
Ah, too bad... You’ve run out of time! But I trust you’ll be back again for another try!
Splendid! That’s the first Rotom Rally you’ve successfully completed! Here’s a little souvenir for the occasion!
Amazing! You’ve earned over [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] points! Here’s a little souvenir for the occasion!
Thank you so much for participating in the Rotom Rally! Here’s a little souvenir for you, as a sign of my gratitude!
If you let me give your bike some extra power, I can make it charge up the turbo boost faster! It’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike more power, I can help the turbo boost charge up even faster! It’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike even more power, I can increase its turbo-boost charge speed to the maximum! It’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
All right, your bike has extra power! Since your turbo boost charges faster now, why not have another go at the Rotom Rally?
All right, your bike has extra power! Since your turbo boost charges faster now, why not have another go at the Rotom Rally?

Stopper message (TBD)
At last, the Gym Challenge’s opening ceremony! My heart is pounding with all the excitement!
Corrr!
Motostoke is something else! What other city has a lift to take you between the upper and the lower districts?
The eight Gym Leaders that challengers have to face... They’re all frightfully strong. I wonder if any of the Gym Challengers stand a chance.
[~ 5]
No wandering into that tall grass for you if you’ve got no Pokémon of your own, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
You can’t go any farther in with that Wooloo standing in the way!
And where do you think you’re off to, then? We’re having a battle—you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Be serious, would you? We’ve got to go look for that Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Sorry, but Team Yell caused quite the kerfuffle, and now the bridge is in a bit of a state... We’ll have things cleaned quick as can be done, but could you give us some time?
If you’re looking for your Bag, [VAR 0100(0000)], didn’t you leave it in your room? And grab yourself a hat for the weather, as well![VAR 0114(0008)]
Heya, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop was looking for you, you know. But no need to go to the next town to find him when he lives right next door, right?
[~ 15]
You did tell your mum that we’re heading to Wedgehurst, right? She’ll go spare if you disappear without a word.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mzzz... Mzzz...
You wouldn’t want to wake up the sweet sleeping Wooloo, right? Better to take the long way round.
Let’s go and meet Lee at the station! It’s dead ahead from here![VAR 0114(0005)]
My Wooloo simply loves the Pokémon Center. Come along, Wooloo! You’re perfectly healed! Time we go back home!
Meeeeeeh...
I lost to the Trainers out training their teams on Route 2... I just can’t believe it... Give me a moment to process, would you? I’m in shock here.
The Slumbering Weald is over this way! Let’s go find that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe the chairman was quite clear. Get your Water Badge at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You must be a Gym Challenger, right? If you’re looking for the Gym Leader, Nessa, she’s off at the lighthouse. The lighthouse is, well... If you head toward the sea from here, you shouldn’t be able to miss it.
We’re blockin’ off this route to get in the way of Gym Challengers—you got that? “Our Marnie’s all done with Hulbury! Our Marnie’s all done with the sea! Our Marnie defeats every leader, and she’ll bring us all sweet victory!”
Team Yell’s hard at work trainin’ up our Pokémon t’be extra hard here in Galar Mine No. 2!
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our chants here?! “You’re not passin’! You’re not passin’! You’re not passin’, not through here! You’ll not get through till we’re all done here!”
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our cheers here?! “M-A-R-N-I-and-E! That’s how we spell victory!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell! “She’s cute! She’s tough! She won’t take no one’s guff! Ooour Marnie! She’s our Marnie!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell! “Glory, glory, to our Marnie! Glory, glory, to our Marnie! Glory, glory, to our Marnie! As our girl goes marchin’ on!”
Excuse me! You need permission to enter the vault here in Hammerlocke!
You can’t drown us out, mate! We’ll just turn the volume up! “M-A-R N-I-E! That spells victory to me! With the knick-knack paddywhack, give Growlithe a bone... Marnie’s gonna send you home!”
[~ 34]
Corviknight is a Pokémon that flies all about carrying people where they want to go. But even they get tuckered out...
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet. You can’t enter without the Fire Badge. Would you like me to take you back to the bridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Got it! Then come with me!
Got it! Well, don’t push yourself too hard. Set up camp or something when you need a rest!
My Corviknight got all rested up, so it’s already headed off on its next Poké Job!

It’s a mailbox that Pokémon collect letters from!
There are so many books! The ad says the magazine with a special feature on all the Gym Leaders is the most popular.
It’s a record shop. Apparently you can find some rare records here.
[~ 22]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
This city is just massive! I need to keep checking my Town Map, otherwise I know I’ll get lost!
Here in the Galar region, I’d say it’s fair to call the Champion a regional hero. We’re all transfixed by everything he does!
You gotta throw Poké Balls! Throw them over and over to get your pitching technique sorted!
Leon throws his Poké Balls with so much energy! I wonder if the Pokémon inside get dizzy?
Churu churu.
[~ 31]
It’s wonderful that there’s space for Steenee to relax and enjoy itself. In fact, I’m tempted to join it and quench my thirst, too!
We use the Pokémon move Growth to raise our flowers, so they get rather large!
I always bring flowers home—on special days or even normal days. My Pokémon loves the scent of flowers so much.
I love flower Pokémon!
Shrinking down to fit in Poké Balls, and the next thing you know, growing massive by Dynamaxing... It must be a lot of work for Pokémon!
Minci minci minci!
Minccino likes things neat and tidy. It’ll brush away any dust with its tail!
I see that you’re working on a Pokédex! You’ll meet lots of different Pokémon if you head to the Wild Area.
There’s something satisfying about actually being able to hold the products when you shop. Then again, buying things online and having Pokémon deliver them to you has its own charm.
You can really tell a person’s character by going shopping with them. My husband...well...he doesn’t think too much about what he buys.
Grrrarock!
Onix is big, but it can get even bigger by Dynamaxing!
Howzit? I came all the way from Alola to watch the Gym Challenge in person!
If I could choose my own uniform number, which one should I pick? I can’t make up my mind!
I can’t wear the same uniform as my favorite Gym Leader. I’d get way too nervous.
Records truly are amazing. They bring life back to singers who no longer can sing...
Mr. Rose has a real love for the Galar region. It’s not enough to help keep us all supplied with energy—he even supports the Gym Challenge!
Steam power’s amazing! It can even move that giant lift!
I’m always frightened by airplanes and whatnot... How those giant chunks of metal move so fast. Pokémon don’t bother me, though.
I never get tired of watching those giant, steam-powered gears turning!
My Toxel likes tinned food way too much.
There are some Pokémon that just love to battle. I guess there’s lots of different ways to live with Pokémon!
It’s fun playing with Mandibuzz, but really I wish I could fly with it!
Buafuah!
Poen poen.
Come on now, Tympole. Time to head home.
In the Galar region, it’s only natural that we help each other out. The cleaning I do is just volunteer work!
Even if there’s no point in having a chin-wag, it’s still great to hear the voice of someone you like!
People can change whenever they want—they just need to want to change... Maybe this old man can make a change, too.
Pokémon need PP, or Power Points, to perform moves!
It’s fine and dandy to have battles in the city, but you need to make sure you don’t get in anyone’s way!
I’m playing hopscotch with Wynaut and my younger sister! Do you know hopscotch? You have to jump your way through the court!
We can play with our Pokémon here!
Wy wynaut.
Once I get my new hairstyle, I’m going to stop by the Rotomi at the Pokémon Center to update my League Card!
I do my best every day and cheer on my favorite Gym Leaders... You really don’t get tired of doing the things you love!
Some people say they like Pokémon because of how strong they are, but I think that their cuteness is part of their appeal, too!
The Gym Challenge is a journey, you know. You travel throughout the region, together with your Pokémon. Remember, if you were able to take the first step, the second step is never quite as hard.
I know old folks like us can get carried away offering advice, but the most important thing for young ones like you is to live the way you want.
Mworp!
Well? What do you think about our secret hideout? We want to make a new Gym!
I bet we would make it the best Gym in Galar in like two years!
The Gym Leaders battle each other separately from the Gym Challenge in order to determine who is stronger.
Don’t you wish people could use Pokémon moves, too? I mean, I bet I could unleash an amazing Hyper Beam!
Most of the companies here in Galar are owned by Chairman Rose!
My favorite person is the Champion! My favorite word is “strongest”!
Ah, Motostoke Stadium! This is where the opening ceremony is held! Exhibition matches are super exciting, too!
You’re participating in the Gym Challenge? I bet you have some dependable Pokémon, then.
You’ve got the Fire Badge! That’s wicked, mate!
The Gym Leaders will show up for the Gym Challenge opening ceremony.
You’re a challenger, right? Don’t let those Gym Leaders beat you!
I was watching your match! I literally shouted with excitement when you defeated Kabu!
The stadium is so huge! I wonder how many houses would fit inside?
The stadium can even handle Dynamax Pokémon battling inside! It is said that long, long ago there was a giant stadium made entirely out of stone.
[~ 86]
I feel like that challenger named Bede has some potential! I bet he’ll pull off something incredible!
My favorite is Leon’s Charizard!
Everyone participating in the Gym Challenge is welcome to stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
We League staff are here to provide support for the various matches that occur throughout the Gym Challenge.
Go, Gym Challenger! Looking forward to it!
Do your best!
I’m cheering for you!
Give it your best shot!
Yeah! So cool!
Go! Go all the way! Just keep going!
Oh! You’re that challenger everyone’s talking about.
You’re gonna face Kabu? Well, good luck!
Kabu’s a strong Trainer. That’s for sure!
Go all out!
All the Gym Leaders... right here!
You’re an amazing Trainer, defeating Kabu and all!
[~ 103]
Great weather, eh, mate?
I can’t believe Kabu lost! What a match!
Hey, Champion! Thanks for everything!
Good day to you!
Hey there! That was a good match!
I heard Kabu’s training his team all over again.
Something good happen?
I wish something good would happen.
Guess I should go look for something good.
That meal was a delight!
Time for some Max Raid Battles in the Wild Area!
I can’t find the TR that I really want...
The Gym Challenge! The Gym Challenge!
I want to battle Leon!
Where’d Leon go?
Cooking while camping is just fantastic!
Curry’s kind of like stew, right?
I hear curry’s really popular in places like Kanto.
It’s so soothing to see Pokémon playing in the city.
My hobby’s going camping and playing with Pokémon!
I bet I could become a camping master!
Oh! You’re the Gym Challenger I’m cheering for!
I’m gonna buy the uniform of my favorite Gym Leader!
Your uniform number is super popular!
Pardon.
Yeah, that makes sense.
That’s about right.
Speed is important! It lets you attack first!
TMs are great! They never break!
The Rotom Rally! The Rotom Rally!
Poké Balls! Great Balls!
Ultra Balls are ultra-great!
Master Balls are a sure catch!
Dynamaxing makes your Pokémon become huge!
Gigantamaxing changes your Pokémon’s look!
You can win a Master Ball through the Loto-ID.
Mworp!
Bworp!

Have you visited Hammerlocke Stadium yet? It looks super rugged!
I’ve been told that Hammerlocke’s Gym Stadium is located right in the center of the Galar region!
Noibat loves fruit! It’s always looking for it using ultrasonic waves!
Squilili squililili!
Hi there, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Trainer! Have you edited your League Card at all? As you gather material for it, it becomes harder and harder to decide what you want to use. It’s so much fun!
I have a friend who told me that he dresses up as a Pokémon and does Poké Jobs. But it’s not me—it’s a friend!
I saw the ruins at Stow-on-Side, but... I don’t really get art sometimes...
She keeps going on about art, but really all that matters is whether you like what you see or not.
These clothes I’m wearing, they were given to me back when I was a student. They’re made from durable Pokémon silk, so I believe they’ll last me a good while yet!
Not too many Gym Challengers make it all the way to Raihan... I really wish we could see more matches with him and his Pokémon.
Opal’s been a Gym Leader for several decades— the very definition of a seasoned veteran... I doubt you’ll stand a chance.
Chairman Rose himself once participated in the Champion Cup. He really took off after the Semifinals!
I heard that the Meowth of Galar look different from the Meowth of Kanto or Alola! I think it’s called a regional form!
I like my curry sweet, but then my father always adds too much bitter seasoning!
A lot of people buy replicas of Leon’s uniform, but nobody can wear it ’cause the cape’s too heavy...
We agreed to meet at the Pokémon Center, but I’ve been here awhile, and still no sign... Maybe I should go check the other Pokémon Centers?
Gastrodon, I choose you! SQUEEEAAA-SQUISHY-SQUISHY-SQUISH!
Rhydon against Gastrodon! I’m at a disadvantage in terms of type matchup, but experience is on my side!
Todon...
Do don!
I saw a Pokémon sucking nectar from a flower, so I decided to copy it!
I wish there were boxed lunches you could eat on the train. They’d be so popular!
Children can’t get through the Wild Area, so we have to ride the train. It’s safe! We don’t need an adult to ride with us!
At that restaurant, the Pokémon is better at cooking my food to perfection.
We all know that dragons guard treasure! It’s definitely fitting that Raihan’s the guardian of the vault.
They say that the Galar region has lots of old buildings!
I’ve heard that Pokémon in the Wild Area hide all sorts of things in their dens. There’re apparently even odd Pokémon that collect TRs!
You really should visit Wyndon sometime. People from all over the world gather there!
Kwaaa!
I wonder if there’s something special about people who find Wishing Stars?
Once I become Champion, I’m going to gather all the Wishing Stars in the world and give them to you!
The curry I made while camping was amazing, but the curry I made at home was only so-so... I wonder what was different?
Oh, are you headed to Stow-on-Side, Gym Challenger? Everyone knows that Route 6 leads on to that good old town!
Hey, this is the final Gym!
You did it! You got the Dragon Badge!
The stadium... Not good. This is not good!
Next is Wyndon! Time for the big event!
I saw your match in the stadium! It was incredible!
What a match! The best battle of this year!
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s go!
I’ll be cheering for you during the Semifinals!
Here [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she comes! It’s that Trainer!
Oh! I know that Trainer! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s super strong!
Hello!
Think only of victory!
Your matches help me feel brave!
How are things?
You’re stronger than Raihan! That’s amazing!
The Champion’s Pokémon are looking good!
Now, where did my Pokémon wander off to...
It’s tough trying to find a Pokémon that can fly.
Turns out my Pokémon was at home the whole time!
Amazing!
Am I ever thirsty... I wish I had some tea...
I want to go on a trip with my Pokémon, but where to?
It really makes my blood boil when I lose a battle!
Time for the Champion Cup!
That red light... It was so scary...
The vault is outside of the stadium.
I heard that underneath the stadium is a power plant!
These stadiums... Such odd buildings.
I want a cool Pokémon to be my partner!
My favorite move is Teatime!
My favorite Ability is Hunger Switch!
My five favorite Pokémon? Oh, I can’t decide...
I want all the clothes from my favorite brand.
My favorite Trainer is the Champion!
It’s a stone statue of a Poké Ball. There’s a rumor that if you touch it, you’ll have better luck catching Pokémon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : z_c0301
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Muuurrrrrrfff!
Wow... This Pokémon is huge...
I’m glad we live in a world where I can coexist with a giant Pokémon like this!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
If you’re sitting, you have to stand up eventually, right? In the same way, even if you’re defeated, sooner or later you’ll get back on your feet.
[~ 6]
Mima mime!
You can tell Leon absolutely loves to battle. Just look at his smile!
Pokémon Trainers are really amazing! I mean, they can compete on the world stage!
Mr. Rose used the power of his company to turn this city into a tourist spot, but without ruining the historical buildings and streets!
How many companies does Mr. Rose own again?
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
This Mr. Mime’s name is Marcel! It’s really amazing!
It must be nice to be a supporter of someone. It’s not easy to be so dedicated to a stranger!
If a Trainer I’m cheering for loses, it really brings me down, as if I was the one who lost! Even if the match itself has nothing to do with me, that’s what it means to be a supporter.
Better to raise it from a Charmander. You’ll form a stronger bond that way.
I’m gonna join the Gym Challenge too, with my very own Charizard!
Hello? Yeah, I got tickets for front-row seats in the stadium! Come on over!
I can’t even keep my siblings under control. I don’t think I could handle raising six Pokémon.
I’m pretending to be Falinks!
I’m pretending to be Falinks, too!
Me? I’ve been a fan of Leon since he first participated in the Gym Challenge!
Anybody can say things like “I’ve been a fan for a long time!” Or “I’ve watched all his matches!” It doesn’t prove that you’re a real fan!
Marnie gave me her autograph just now! It’s my treasure!
Isn’t this a huge Ferris wheel? It’s known as the Galar Hurricane.
Don’t listen to my sister—she’s just making things up.
Bridges connect two separate things, so they can be seen as symbols of friendship, too!
When I see a truly amazing battle, it fills my whole body with energy! I’ve got all the respect in the world for Trainers who can put on matches like that!
Pokémon that work in the hotels and Pokémon that participate in battles... They all have a sharp look to them!
[~ 31]
Brrrheeeim!
This kind Pokémon carried us all the way to the hotel.
You’ve gotta give it to Mudsdale. I’ve never seen it overloaded, no matter how many people are riding it!
I can change my job or even my home, but I can’t change my favorite challenger and my favorite Pokémon!
Growlithe! I’ll race you to the stadium!
Raihan likes to use Sandstorm first!
I’ll use my speedy Pokémon to defeat any Pokémon that try to change the weather!
Bork!
[~ 40]
Exactly! My Growlithe lost so much weight!
Running a full circle around Wyndon certainly burns a lot of calories...
I clean so that I can properly appreciate the beauty of the flowers.
I’m going for a picnic with my Pokémon!
I cross the bridge one way feeling anticipation for the match I’m going to watch, and then I cross the bridge the other way feeling excited after seeing an amazing match!
We can just walk to the stadium, but challengers have to win if they want to reach it...
I wonder how many houses would fit inside Wyndon Stadium?!
You never know the weather until you wake up. You never know who will win until it’s done.
Everybody in the world watches the same match. That means everybody in the world can talk to each other about that same match!
Great matches will always be remembered by the crowd!
Kantonians and Galarians both seem to like waiting in lines...
Get your official merchandise here! We also have League Cards!
I came looking for rare League Cards, but they’re all sold out!
Today’s weather is perfect for a match! I mean, I say that for any weather, and the stadium has a roof, but still.
Would you care for some Pokémon snacks or Pokémon drinks?
I wasn’t thirsty at all, but all these juices look so good that now I feel parched!
Challengers are just too amazing... Any mistake they make is seen by tens of thousands of fans, but the challengers just keep on battling as if it were nothing. They must all have nerves of steel!
He says he likes someone who’s fun to be with, even when they’re eating their usual food.
I think the reason why we feel restaurant food is so much better than normal food is because of the novelty of it all.
We’ll show you the full power of Team Yell!
We’re gonna stay out of trouble this time. I mean, we want to watch the matches, too!
[~ 62]
I’m not gonna go into the stadium just yet. I want to enter it as a challenger!
Welcome, Challenger! Please, battle to your heart’s content!
Time for the final match... Everyone’s got their eyes on you!
That was the best match I’ve ever seen!
Welcome, Challenger! Please, battle to your heart’s content!
This might be the first time we see a Trainer defeat Leon.
I...I’m speechless... That was just...amazing...
Leon, Leon, the greatest Champion ever! ♪ Leon, Leon, will he be beaten? Never! ♪
My sister just keeps singing Leon’s cheering song!
Charizard’s Max Flare is different from any other Pokémon’s!
I won’t lie—I started cheering for Leon because my child is a huge fan.
I’m taking as many pictures as I can. They’re like little slices of time.
I feel like my Pokémon always smiles when we take photos together.
Cheeez!
I’ve got my eyes set on Wyndon Stadium!
[~ 78]
Kraw! Kraw!
[~ 80]
Krow row!
[~ 82]
Cheers!
Nothing like a good match to spice up your day.
Amazing matches make me want to work hard, too!
Much obliged.
Much obliged!
Much obliged!!!
Good day!
Kids have their whole future ahead of them!
The future’s in your hands, Champion!
I can’t wait to see Dynamax Pokémon!
Being able to see Pokémon Gigantamax is the best!
So, Sonia’s finally decided to become a professor, eh?
The Champion’s match!
Oh man, I can’t believe Hop lost...
I love Leon, but I love the new Champion, too!
So many people! It’s a little intimidating...
People from all over the world gather here, huh!
The Galar region’s growing on me.
I always bring up the weather when meeting new people...
I can’t stop myself from saying what’s on my mind.
There were Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald after all!
I train myself together with my Pokémon!
The important thing about training is to never give up.
A strong will is the secret to becoming a strong Trainer!
Yaaay! I’m a Charizard!
I’m gonna Dynamax someday!
I swear I’ll beat the Champion!
This city’s huge... Let me check my Town Map.
Even kids can ride the Flying Taxis!
I like the monorail, too. I think it’s kinda cute!
There must be at least one ninja around here...
Was there a Pokémon that was like a ninja?
Maybe I’ll challenge the Champion myself!
I’ve got my Charizard pose down pat!
I feel a new Champion is about to be born!
I need to get all the official merchandise!
At last! The final match!
The final showdown... This is so exciting!
Hey, it’s [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Strong and noble! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] is the best!
I’m cheering for you both! Show us a good match!
Go on! Show us what you can do!
Please! Can I have an autograph?!
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
If you want to get around Wyndon, you’ve come to the right Flying Taxi, guv’nor! Where’d you like to go?
The Rose of the Rondelands Hotel
Wyndon Stadium
Monorail Station
Rose Tower
Battle Tower
Never mind
You got it, guv! Let’s get moving, Corviknight!
Aw, that’s too bad. Well, let me know if you ever need a ride!
All right, guv, here we are! Just come to me if you need a ride again!
Talkin’ to me ain’t gonna help you find the bad guy, now is it? I’ll cheer you on, so go out there and track him down![VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara!
So there are good League staff members, and then there’s this bad League staff member, and the only difference is that the bad one is wearing sunglasses? Why even bother with the different look, then?
If I were this bad League staff member, I’d just lose the sunglasses...
We’re crazy busy because of the Champion Cup, and yet I can’t get to Rose Tower... Some League staff aren’t doing their jobs!
There are some League staff that’ve gone and started up a fan club dedicated to Ms. Oleana...
I’ve heard that the Champion and Chairman Rose are having a very important discussion right now... I wonder what it’s all about?
It’s finally time for the Champion Cup! Being super busy makes you want to slack off, doesn’t it?
I want to get to Rose Tower but the monorail isn’t moving...
There’s no sign of that bad League staff! Where’d they go?!
I’m looking for something to look for!

Hiya! Me and my little sister have set ourselves up as a pop-up Pokémon Center service. Not that we asked anyone if we could or should. Galar Mine is pretty rough on a team, isn’t it? I’ll heal up your Pokémon for you, friend.
Come talk to me anytime you think your team needs a bit of care!
Welcome to our pop-up Pokémon Center! You want your team healed up again?
Thanks for waiting! Your [VAR 0101(0000)] should be all better now!
Thanks for waiting! [VAR 0101(0000)] and the rest of your team should be all better now!

Why does Spikemuth have its shutter down? Are they having a party in there?
What’s this? The earth is shaking?! Maybe if I try to sway in the same way... Nope, not helping!

The Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, specializes in Dark-type Pokémon. He’s a decent bloke, though.
That cape with all the logos... Was that the Champion running by?!
With the shutter down, nobody’s going to be able to attempt the Gym Challenge.
I hope everything is OK in Hammerlocke...
All this red light! Is it Dynamax light?
How? How can wild Pokémon Dynamax when we’re nowhere near a Power Spot?
The Champion and Charizard are superheroes!
Oh, I know! The geoglyph! This is a replica of the geoglyph on the hill!

Going to the Wild Area is a snap if you use the Flying Taxis!
If you want to heal up your Pokémon, there’s nothing like setting up your camp and cooking them a good meal. Here, you can add this Berry to the pot!
If you ever come across a tent, check it out to join the camp of whoever set it up. If you’d like, you’re welcome to visit my camp too—it’s this one right here!
If your precious Pokémon get injured, don’t forget to heal them up with a Potion! And you need Antidotes to fix up poison. Just remember to stock up on items, and you won’t have to visit Pokémon Centers so often!

Anyone would want to wear the same uniform as their favorite Gym Leader!
Even if your Pokémon are doing just fine, there’s nothing wrong with setting up your tent and having a little cookout!
If your Pokémon are a bit low on energy, set up your tent and give them some food!
Camping with your Pokémon, playing together, cooking together... these are all great ways to become closer with your Pokémon. You’re welcome to stop by my camp, too, if you’d like!

If you’re on a bicycle, you want to get to your destination as quickly as possible, right? That’s why we race!
What is the problem with those Team Yell goons? I can understand wanting to cheer someone on, but they cause so much trouble in the process! Hardly a decent way for fans to behave.
That big building you see in the distance is Hammerlocke Stadium! You’re going to battle there, too!
The secret to preparing an amazing meal is stirring it just right, over the perfect heat! You know you’re doing great if the top of the pot starts sparkling. Why not stop by my camp and practice cooking a bit?

My brilliant little Mragnar is the best! She gives me Berries that she’s found when we camp together! Do your Pokémon do that? I guess it must be proof of how friendly she feels toward me. My Pokémon are all so very sweet and such good friends. You should come play with them, too!

Hop’s House
Deeeeeew!
It’s a well-used barbecue! The grill is perfectly seasoned.

You see that house in the distance, with the purple roof? That’s where the Pokémon Professor lives.
Having a meal with your Pokémon makes the food taste extra good!
I heard that Leon has a younger brother... I bet he’s an amazing Trainer, just like Leon!
All around here is just quiet countryside, but wait until you see a big city. It’ll take your breath away!
Pokémon become stronger by battling. But how you raise them is where you get to show off your skills as a Trainer.
Leon’s just amazing! He’s a superstar to everyone!
The Charizard pose! Just doing the pose along with Leon makes me feel like I’ve gotten stronger!
In the morning, my Pokémon wakes me up, and in the evening, I put my Pokémon to bed... I can’t imagine a life without Pokémon!
I’ve just remembered what the sign here used to say. “To the right is the Pokémon Lab. On the opposite side is the station.”
I used to want to be a professional Pokémon Trainer when I grow up! But I can’t think about Pokémon day in and day out, the way Leon does...
It’s fun to do some shopping in a boutique! Even just getting a new hat can change your whole look!
If you’re looking for the Pokémon Professor, you can usually find her at her lovely home by the lake, enjoying the slow life.
Basics for Pokémon Trainers, lesson one! The Pokémon at the top of your team will be the first one to enter battle!
If you ever get lost during your travels, don’t forget your trusty Town Map!

In order to bring out the full strength of their Pokémon, Trainers must be knowledgeable!

Milo does more than just work the fields. He raises beautiful flowers, too!
Fluff fluff...
If you hold flowers, Pokémon will gather around you!
The League Cards of Gym Leaders tell all sorts of stories.
You can challenge the Gyms as many times as you want. I guess it’s to test your unbreakable will!
If you’ve never seen it before, you should really go see the amazing scenery from the hilltop. In fact, you should go see it again even if you have seen it before.
That geoglyph... I heard nobody knows its name. Maybe it was a forbidden name or something...
I took a photo of the geoglyph, but it just doesn’t compare to seeing it yourself. Still, looking at the photo is enough to bring back a rush of emotions!
How can a geoglyph drawn ages ago last for so long without eroding away? It’s so perplexing! If I think too much about it, I won’t be able to sleep.
You know what I think? I think the geoglyph was created with the help of Pokémon.
I wanna stick my head into the photo stand-in when I grow taller!
Such mysterious stone structures... Were they made by people...or by Pokémon?
If you don’t take proper care of your equipment, it can fail you when you really need it.
Route 5 is really long... It feels good to speed through it, though!
More people are coming to see the geoglyph these days.
You could say Milo raised all the Trainers here!
The new Champion is pretty amazing!
Time for the Gym Challenge. How exciting!
I can’t believe Milo lost...
Hey, is that the Champion...?
Wait, I have to wait my turn for the Gym Challenge?!

I feel like the time you spend trying to make up your mind is the true essence of shopping.
You’ll have no trouble in the Gym Challenge if you take the time to train up now!
Mew meowow.
Why does Nessa love the lighthouse so much...?
Galar is a huge island. Lighthouses have always been really important in helping ships find their way.
When you see one of those giant Pokémon while fishing in the Wild Area, it feels like it’s either catch or be caught!
Nessa’s really stoic about Pokémon. She’s made her Gym mission really tough!
I remember when I did the Gym Challenge... I never did get the Water Badge.
I’ve got high hopes for you! I mean, I say that to every challenger, of course.
Freshly harvested veggies! Look good, don’t they? Freshly gathered Berries! I guess they look good?
Mistakes aren’t that bad when you cook with your mates. At least they make for funny stories!
Galar Mine No. 2 is a good spot. It’s full of rock-solid Pokémon.
Truuummm!
Chairman Rose!
Can I have an autograph?!
I bet it’s gonna be tough to defeat Nessa.
You defeated Nessa! You’re quite the Trainer!
Eternatus... What in the world was that?
Just keep going, me. Just keep going and going.
Nessa always gathers the best food!
I’m aiming for the title of Champion now, too!
Nothing’s biting...
Maybe I’ll head to the Wild Area to do my fishing...
Where’s a good fishing spot?
I got an autograph from the chairman!
Maybe I’ll head over to the Captain’s Table.
Gotta love that ocean breeze blowing through!
Let’s see, what’s the specialty of Hulbury...?
The local specialty is seafood! Good, I already ordered some.
Maybe I’ll stay here forever!
Hi there, Gym Challenger!
Good job on the Water Badge.
Hello, Champion!
Nessa does seem to love the lighthouse...
What’s the deal with those Team Yell goons?!
I hear there’s a Pokémon that’s a great detective!
It’s a record shop. Apparently you can find some rare records here.

Just getting here was so satisfying! I can’t imagine what seeing the ruins will feel like!
Every time I see the ruins, I’m enamored of them. Why are they so appealing to me, I wonder...
We’re using the mural to bring more business to our town! Actually, we’ve been doing that for a long time, now.
Raca raca taaa...
Shashakaaay!
My uncle’s Pokémon here is slacking off. The Pokémon that we hired for the Poké Job is looking sharp, though!
Come on! Let’s play with Bronzong!
Zudadadada!
Um, um, where is your mouth?
I wanna wear Bronzong on my head!
Can Bronzong really make it rain?!
Diggy diggy dig!
Why not buy some ruins souvenirs? They’re quite valuable, you know. You can only get them here!
I’ve already got enough luggage, mate... They do look cool, though.

Driiig.

Dudd dudd dudd.
I want to show the Stow-on-Side ruins to my Diglett. Who knows—maybe it’ll awaken some latent artistic talent, right?
What’s going on?! I heard a huge noise come from the direction of the mural! Is this some sort of surprise event for tourists?
We should let the people at Ballonlea know about what happened with the mural. Let’s see now... To reach Ballonlea, you have to head through that mushroom forest.
Cap cap.
The places where you can Dynamax your Pokémon are known as Power Spots. The Gym Stadiums of the Galar region are built on these Power Spots.
Wh-wh-what’s going on?! What’s happening at the ruins?
Wh-wh-what’s this? The hero was actually two people and Pokémon?
Quite an impressive Gym Stadium!
Sudden, big noises are a great way to get people feeling uneasy...
I feel it was more artistic before it got destroyed.
The ocean, huh... Not a mountain, huh...
I’ve seen you before... Are you a Gym Challenger?
That young lady, Sonia... She’s researching the truth about the ruins, right? Could she be the granddaughter of Professor Magnolia?
Some Pokémon live in the mountains, some Pokémon live in the forests! So many different species!
What was that noise...? Thunder? No, it couldn’t have been...
If you want to get to Ballonlea, you’ll need to make your way through Glimwood Tangle. Remember, in Glimwood Tangle... It’s important to touch the mushrooms.
Are you a tourist? Or a Gym Challenger?
What a match! A fantastic battle, that!
It’s the Champion that discovered the hidden ruins!
I hear the Gym mission really makes you dizzy!
Everyone seems wobbly, even if they get the Badge...
Wow, the Champion! Wicked!
I got some great deals in the market!
I made a huge amount of money in the market!
The market hasn’t been too good to me recently...
To be honest...I don’t think the mural looks that good.
I can’t wait to catch more Pokémon!
The destroyed mural... I liked how messy it looked.
It’s Stow-on-Side’s famous mural. It’s said to be a very deep work of art...
It’s the statues that were hidden behind Stow-on-Side’s famous mural. They depict two heroes and two Pokémon.

Welcome to the town of snow! You already know the name of this town, right?
Suh suh snoh!
My Clobbopus just spent a good chunk of time in the hot spring. Its body is toasty warm now!
Igna!
I hear that Pokémon in Poké Balls or Boxes are nice and comfortable.
The Hero’s Bath... I hear this hot spring has been around since ancient times.
I watch the Gym Leaders’ matches on the giant telly in the stadium!
Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Ice-type moves! Maybe they don’t like cold, huh?
Muscles! No cold is too cold if you have powerful muscles to keep you warm!
You’re in trouble if your Pokémon gets frozen during a battle! It won’t be able to move!
Are snowmen Pokémon?
I know there are Ice-type Pokémon, but is there such a thing as snowman Pokémon?
[~ 12]
The falling snow hides the Ice-type Pokémon around here really well.
Seems like the hot spring’s a perfect temperature today, too. Only Pokémon bathe in it, though.
It’s easy to get depressed when it’s cold. But Darumaka are able to store more strength the colder it gets. I’m jealous!
Rolly roll.
Fliter fliter.
Shhhwaaaaaah.
Dei de de.
Kuuu ku ku.
Fwooomf.
Ahhh, this is the life!
There are two challengers I’ve got my eyes on— Challenger Hop and Challenger Marnie.
We shouldn’t forget about Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], right?
Seems like the hot spring’s a perfect temperature today, too. Only Pokémon bathe in it, though.
Is that a Persian engraved on this wall?
Goro goh!
The stones paving the ground are quite cold. Snow piles up on them in no time.
There are plenty of people who enjoy Pokémon battles, even if they can’t participate in the Gym Challenge. Actually, there are people who don’t battle at all, too.
They say this is the hot spring where the hero rested his wounded body.
I try to remove chance from my battles as much as possible, but sometimes I still feel it all comes down to luck...
I thought I was going to lose for sure, but then my Pokémon scored a critical hit!
Iiissse.
The Gym Challenge is reaching its end.
I wonder who made it to the tournament?
Becoming the Champion on your first try... Amazing!
I love the snow so much!
I, said the Pokémon.
If rain is the sky crying, then what is snow?
I’m just keeping an eye on the town.
I’ve been walking around so much, I’m almost too healthy!
Nothing like a nice, long walk after a good meal!
I need to get curry toppings at Bob’s Your Uncle.
The curry is what brings the rice and ingredients together.
All sorts of flavors become one in curry.
People and Pokémon should be full of energy!
Getting Badges is no trouble with enough energy!
The Gym Challenge was such a great competition this year!
The ancient hero liked the hot spring, huh?
What exactly did the hero do?
Is the Champion a hero?
The ancient Hero’s Bath. It is said that heroes bathed here to heal and rest.
Sometimes the only thing to do in the cold weather is have an ice cream!
[~ 54]
Ice types are the perfect fit for icy towns! Snom is just right at home!
Nothing like Fire types for icy towns! I’m toasty warm thanks to Sizzlipede!

Even a run-down place like this is important for the people and Pokémon who live here.
I won’t quit Team Yell! I’ll keep cheerin’ for Marnie!
I’m a huge fan of Piers. I’d really fancy seeing him in more matches.
At the end of the day, this place’d be more lively if there were more Gym Challengers.
Speaking of Piers, he refuses to Dynamax his Pokémon! But the chairman tried to move the Gym to a kinda faraway place near a Power Spot.
Closing the shutter to sabotage the other challengers was right poor sportsmanship.
Pokémon’ve got to work hard for a Gym Trainer like me to do well. Cheers, mates!

And now that you’ve grown so strong, perhaps it’s time I started looking ahead myself.
It’s time we adults started working on improving the here and now, for the sake of all that’s to come!
And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What you ought to do now is...
believe in yourself and your partner Pokémon, and keep on blasting ahead!
In order to create that bright future we all hope to see!
People of Galar!
Here you have it! A new legend born right before your eyes!
Your Champion, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Bet you can’t wait to see what kind of future a kid with this kind of strength might bring about!
I sure can’t! Let’s watch and see what [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she can do!

Ranked Battles let you compete with Pokémon Trainers all over the world.
It’s nerve-racking to battle against Trainers all over the world. That’s why you should learn every possible way to battle at the Battle Tower.
Leon...he transformed Rose Tower into the Battle Tower when he became its owner. He’s no longer the Champion, but he really wants to make everyone strong! I admire him!
I’ll keep battling and steadily raise my rank!

I’m Ball Guy! I’m here to cheer everyone on, whether they want me to or not!
It’s the Ball Guy! Who are you on the inside?
Aaah! A Poké Ball monster!
I feel like Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] has a balanced team, but [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she doesn’t have any way to decisively win, you know?
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ll remember your name from now on! I’ve always loved how decisive your party is!
I guess the Champion’s going to extend his winning streak again.
The unbeatable Champion was defeated, and a new Champion was born. We got to witness history being made!
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! Remember, the Semifinals and Finals are just speed bumps on your way to facing Leon. You have to win!
You made it to the Champion Cup! That’s amazing! You really are a powerful challenger now, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Everyone in Galar wants to see what you can do!
You made it all the way to the Championship Match! You can’t lose now! You have to win, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You have to beat the unbeatable Leon and bring a new era to Galar!
It’s the great Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! I was the first one to see you had the potential to become Champion! Maybe I can become a Trainer trainer some day since I’m so good at discovering talent! Hee hee... I’m just joking. Seriously though, congratulations! I’m so happy for you!
Ba ba bug!
E-excuse me, but... could I get a handshake?
Of course!
It’d be my pleasure
Th-thank you so much! I’m never going to forget this!
I’m a huge fan, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! I want to become as strong as you someday!
So [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she made it this far, huh.
I wonder who’ll win?
I can’t tell who’s going to finally win!
Oh, it’s [VAR 0100(0000)]! So cool...
It’s Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Give it your best shot! No regrets!
The whole world is watching this match!
It’s the new Champion! Your battle had me in tears!
Oh my goodness! It’s [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s go!
You can do it!
You’ve got to beat Leon! You just have to!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!
We’re counting on you to keep the Galar region nice and lively, Champion!
Until the emergency in Hammerlocke settles down, there’s nothing we can do...

Uh... Now who was I again? ... ... ... ... ... ... Oh yes! I’m the Move Deleter! I can make Pokémon forget their moves.
You’re here so I can make your Pokémon forget a move, um-hmm?
Which Pokémon would that be?
Just remember me when there’s something you want to forget!
What’s that, friend? That Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
What’s this, friend? Eggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.
Mm-hmm... And which move should it forget?
It was a great success! Your Pokémon has forgotten that it ever even knew [VAR 0107(0000)]!
Everyone calls me Madam Memorial. I know every move that a Pokémon learns as it grows, you see. I can also help your Pokémon remember any of those moves that it has let go in the past. I’ll help your Pokémon recover their lost moves in exchange for Heart Scales, if you have any.
Would you like to remind your Pokémon of a long-forgotten move?
If there’s a move you want one of your Pokémon to recall, bring me a [VAR 0109(0000)]!
Which Pokémon is it?
That is an Egg.
This Pokémon doesn’t yet have any moves to be recovered.
Which move would you like it to remember?
You gave a [VAR 0109(0000)] in thanks.
Now it has remembered that move! Come again if you need anything else!
Would you like me to teach Volt Tackle to your Pikachu?

I found this three days ago, but I’ll give it to you!
Though...use caution, you know? It is at least three days old, after all.
I don’t know how this ended up in my pocket... so here—why don’t you take it!
The question is...how did it get in my pocket?
I was just walking along when this fell on me from above... Why don’t you take it?
After all, I’ve only got painful memories of it... hitting me on the head, that is.
I stumbled upon this buried in the ground. Why don’t you have it?
I don’t plan on being tripped up in my journey, so better you to take it than me!
A wild Pokémon was holding this when I caught it. Take it!
Do you think Pokémon like these things, too?
I found something amazing just now. Think I’ll give it to you!
It’s amazing, so you’d better take proper care of it and not lose it!
Do you know if there’s anything to find over yonder?
Seeing all this wide, open space...simply makes you want to run wild, doesn’t it?
I’m gonna find loads of Pokémon!
Hey, fancy meeting you again! Hope you’re doing well.

I’m crazy strong and flush with cash! Why won’t anyone battle me?! How about you? Dare to take me on?
You’re crazy strong, too! I’ll teach you a good trick then. There are heaps of items lying around the Wild Area that people have dropped! Go around picking them up and then selling ’em off, and you can be flush with cash, too!
I’ll work on getting even stronger yet, so come find me for another battle sometime!
Ahhh! Winning makes me feel generous, so I think I’ll teach you a good trick! There are heaps of items lying around the Wild Area that people have dropped! Go around picking them up and then selling ’em off, and you can be flush with cash, too!
Hey there! I found a bit of a rare item here in the Wild Area. You want it? Only [VAR 0200(0000)] W!
Looks like we have a deal! I hope it helps you out a bit on your adventure!
You enjoying the Wild Area? You know some items are easiest to get through Max Raid Battles, right?
Hahaha! I guess it does sound a bit suspect when you stop to think about it, eh? But if you change your mind, you know where to find me!
I fished up something brilliant! This is absolutely...brilliant! Want my brilliant find for a brilliant bargain of just [VAR 0203(0000,002C)] W?!
Well, that was a brilliant choice you just made! Then here you are! As promised!
Think I’ll fish myself up another brilliant find!
Whaaat?! What a brilliant blunder for you...
All right. Snap to it. Let the battle begin!
Oh, yes? Right then. Right shame that is.
You don’t have enough Watts, pal... Try checking out any glowing dens you find to gather up some more!
You don’t have enough brilliant beaming Watts! You’d better hurry, or I might hook a better deal!
There’s energy pouring out from the den!
There’s a bit of energy trickling out of the den...
You obtained [VAR 0204(0000,002C)] W!
Heya, all right? We two brothers are known as the Digging Duo! We’re digging up treasure here, see?
You’ve got a fair bit of luck finding us here! If you’d like to spot us some Watts, we’ll dig you up some handy treasures for your adventure!
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of stamina, but when it comes to skill, my brother’s the best! Want me to dig you up some treasure? It’ll only cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] W! And a wee saving of your progress, too.
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of skill, but when it comes to stamina, my bro’s the best! Want me to dig you up some treasure? It’ll only cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] W! And a wee moment to save your progress, too.
Thanks for your support! Then I’ll dig up all I can for ya!
Thanks for your support! Then I’ll dig up the best find I can for ya!

Bingo! It’s [VAR 1302(0000,0000)][VAR 010A(0000)]!
Should I keep digging, then?
Yeah? Probably wise. I’ve still got some petrol in the ol’ tank, though.
Phew! I’m all tuckered out... I guess that’s probably it for this dig!
I managed to dig up [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s this time. Take good care of [VAR 1101(0000,0402)]itthem!
Oh? What... You haven’t got the Watts! If you want more Watts, maybe try searching out some Pokémon Dens and looking into them!
Wait! No! I’m not finished yet! I can still keep on digging!
Dig for me!
I’m good
What’s your best record?
My greatest record is [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s in one go. Told you I wasn’t lacking in stamina, eh?
My greatest record is [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s in one go. Told you I wasn’t lacking in skill, eh?
Whoa?! Feast your eyes on this one! This is a mighty rare find, you jammy thing!
You! Yes, you! You’ve got Pokémon with you, haven’t you? You camp with them, don’t you? And you cook alongside them, right? Delicious curries will cure them of whatever ails them, you know! And you can get Berries to cook up curries at trees like that one right there! Yes, right there! And if you want more ingredients, talk to me! I’ll sell you all my freshest finds for real cheap!
How are you doing, young friend? Would you like me to help see you to the next town?
To Motostoke, please!
To Hammerlocke, please!
No, thanks
[~ 102]
Then simply leave it to me!
Here we are! And when you’ve trained up a bit, give the Wild Area another chance, would you? She’s got some fine secrets, she does.
If your Pokémon are ever getting a bit ragged out here, set up camp and cook them up a nice meal to have them feeling better in no time.
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “The large Pokémon you see wandering around in the Wild Area are strong! “If you try battling one and it seems like you’re in over your head, try to run! Run like the wind!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “Cooking at your camp can restore HP to your Pokémon, and even the PP they need to use their moves over and over! “Pokémon that have fainted and can’t battle any longer will perk right up as well with a piping hot plate of curry before them! “Visit Berry trees to collect plenty of Berries, so you can always make more curries!”
Hi there! Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Thanks for stopping by! Would you like to buy anything before you go?
On your way to Motostoke? If you are, you’ll find it just up over that rise and to the east! Once you find the walls of the city, just follow them till you reach the stairs!
Isn’t there anyone who wants to come join me for a Max Raid Battle? If only people would let me know on Y-Comm, I’d have them join me in a heartbeat!
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “Use the Right Stick to rotate the camera when you’re in the Wild Area! “And if you press the Right Stick, you’ll find you can see a wider view of things! “Press the L Button to look straight ahead again!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “The Wild Area is overflowing with a special sort of energy, measured in Watts! “You can gather Watts yourself from glowing Pokémon Dens and glowing Pokémon in the wild! “You’ll also find Trainers in the Wild Area who are willing to give you all sorts of items if you’ll just give them some of your Watts!”
[VAR 0100(0000)]
There’s something written on the old pedestal. Do you want to read it?
May 7 Once, these lusciously green lands of ours lay barren. The grass wilted. Our crops withered. This was a tundra shrouded in frigid cold.
Many days into a bleak winter, a Pokémon appeared on the tundra—adorned with a regal crown yet wounded and weak. Full of pity, our people brought the Pokémon to our village and saw to its care.
August 18 Under the care of our ancestors’ healing ways, the visitor’s wounds mended. It shrank back in fear if approached with open palms, so all kept their hands closed in its presence.
Once it regained its full strength, the visitor emitted a dazzling blue light that breathed life back into our wilted fields, blessing them with the promise of harvests once more. Perhaps this was its way of showing its gratitude.
November 30 Green flourished once more around our village, and rich soil began to spread. Vast lands lay open for farming once more. The village folk began to call the visitor a king in appreciation.
Our village had long been plagued by a ruffian that ran rampant through the fields, devouring crops as it pleased. But the king, resplendent in its full power, suddenly spoke to us in our tongue, vowing to rein in the ruffian.
January 2 Before long, the ruffian had bent its knees to the king and become its loyal steed. Our people’s faith in the king grew firm and unwavering.
Our ancestors built a temple around the sacred sapling atop a tall mountain to give the king a worthy home. Moreover, they crafted a set of reins to let the king command its proud steed with ease.
April 21 The king brought abundance and life to this land that was once frozen tundra. We owe these very Crown Plains to our king.
And as long as the bond between us people and our king holds strong, these lands will no doubt thrive for all time in fertile green.

Oh...my gosh! I saw...THE most...AWESOME Pokémon EVER! I can show you its awesome Pokédex entry for just [VAR 0203(0000,002C)] W, if you like!
Really? You DON’T want to see it? Are you absolutely...COMPLETELY positive?
Have a look, then! Feast your eyes on its awesome splendor!
Is that not completely...TOTALLY awesome? You’ll find different Pokémon depending on the weather, so make sure to search EVERY day!
You don’t have enough Watts! Go find some... and THEN I’ll show it to you!
It seems you have stumbled a little on your path. Let us get poor Kubfu healed up.
Kubfu is back in fighting shape! May the tide’s flow favor you as you face the Tower of Waters.
First, let us restore your Pokémon to full health.
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!

Hey! Guess what? I’ve just found a great big load of Apricorns! I might even be willing to give you one... if you let me have [VAR 0203(0000,002C)] W!
What? You didn’t need one? And they were such a bother to gather, too...
Here you are, then! Freshly gathered Apricorn!
Y’know, if you feed four Apricorns to the Cram-o-matic in the Dojo, I’ve heard you miiight just get a rare type of ball!
You haven’t got enough Watts! Go get some, and then I’ll let you have one!
All our young’ns have gone off to live in the big city. It’s tough for us old folks, getting by with only our Pokémon.
We only grow enough crops to keep the village folk fed. We’re self-sufficient, and nothing goes to waste.
When you’re trudging through snow, you’ve got to really stamp down with your heels. Helps keep you from face-planting in a snowdrift!
Every year, the cold seems to bite harder. It’s gettin’ to be too much for these old bones.
Our village may not be the liveliest place, but do have a relaxing stay and enjoy the sights. I suppose there’s not much to see besides that old statue...but enjoy the one sight, anyway.
Have you had a look at our statue of the King of Bountiful Harvests?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Mayor’s House
Freeze Inn
The door’s locked. Seems you can’t get in just now...
What’s this? There’s a note stuck in the door! “I’ll be at the fields in the Giant’s Bed. —Chief”
It’s a statue of the King of Bountiful Harvests! What a large crown it’s got!
There’s a large, red flag planted in the ground!

Welcome to the Dream Park! Where dreams become reality and Fossils become Pokémon!
Do you have any Fossils on you? Do you wanna turn ’em back into Pokémon?
[~ 2]
Which Fossil do you want to restore back into a Pokémon then?
All righty! You just leave it up to me! I’m gonna turn that [VAR 0109(0000)] of yours back into a Pokémon lickety-split!
What, you don’t want me to restore your Fossil? Tch! Don’t you get how amazing this chance is?
[~ 6]
I turned that Fossil of yours right back into the Pokémon it used to be! This here is [VAR 0101(0001)]! You’d better take right good care of it!
You obtained [VAR 0101(0001)]!
[~ 9]
Hmm? Now color me surprised! Your team’s just packed with Pokémon! I guess I’ll just have to take care of this lovable little lug until you come back with some space!
Someday this whole place is going to be filled to bursting with Pokémon from the ancient past. That’s my dream for this: the Dream Park! To bring the ancient world back to life!

No, thanks
If you want to meet mysterious Pokémon that disappeared from the world long ago... Then you’ll have to find some Fossils first! You do know about Fossils, right?
If you find any Fossils, you can have my pa take a look at them for you.
Fossils are the remains of ancient Pokémon that have been preserved in the ground. They can be restored and brought back to life so we can meet those ancient Pokémon again! What do you think? It’s pretty amazing, right?
Wow! You’re pretty amazing yourself! You’ve found every known Fossil that can be restored into a living Pokémon, haven’t you? That is just so amazing that I think I will have to give you a little reward! This is your proof of being a Fossil Master!
Are you a Fossiphiliac, too? A Fossil fan, my fine [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! If you are, you might know the answer to this... What did my sweet [VAR 0109(000A)] turn into when I had it restored? If you’d like to see for yourself, how about a Pokémon battle?
That’s a real shame! Don’t let that refusal fossilize—come back and fight me anytime!
That’s right! Sweet little [VAR 0109(000A)] becomes a fine [VAR 0101(000B)]!
I hope I’ll get to meet more sweet little Fossils soon, not just my [VAR 0109(000A)]!

Welcome, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! The tournaments here are always open to you, of course! Give one a try, won’t you?
Welcome, Champion! Would you like to take part in a tournament?
Understood! Perhaps next time, then!
Is there a particular Trainer you’d like to invite to take part in the tournament today?
There is someone...
No one in particular
Who would you like to invite to take part?
Next
Quit
[VAR 0100(0000)]
You’d like to invite [VAR 0100(0000)]?
Then I’ll take you through to the pitch. And good luck!
Very good! It looks like your invitation has been accepted! I’ll take you through to the pitch now. And good luck!
Congratulations on another victory! Please take your reward!
We look forward to your next visit!
Well, that’s a rather disappointing outcome... But you’ll get ’em next time, Champion! We look forward to your next visit!
You’re on a real roll, Champion! Let me offer my ultra-great congratulations!
I’m really feeling bowled over here... So here! Take this and have a ball battling!
Welcome, Champion! Leon is waiting for you.
You need a partner if you want to participate in the Galarian Star Tournament. Why not go speak to the Trainers around here? They might be looking for a partner, too!
Very good. We’ll register you and Marnie as partners. Now then, are you ready to proceed?
Very good. We’ll register you and Hop as partners. Now then, are you ready to proceed?
Yes
No
In that case, please head into the locker room.
Understood. Please just come and speak to me when you’re ready!
Welcome! Which competition would you like to take part in this time?
The usual tournament
The Galarian Star Tournament
Never mind
Very good. In that case, please choose your partner!
Congratulations! Here’s something to commemorate your victory!
[VAR BE05(0006)]You received [VAR 0205(0001,002C)] for winning!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Sport Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
One more thing. It seems there are some more Trainers who want to pair up with you after seeing your amazing performance this time. Why not try teaming up with someone new the next time you decide to participate?
Too bad about this time, but you still get a participation award!
We hope you decide to participate again soon!
One more thing. It seems there are some more Trainers who want to pair up with you after—
Well, well, well![VAR 0114(0042)]
If it isn’t M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]! It seems your talents have only grown greater since we last met![VAR 0114(0042)]
I would expect no less from one whom we ourselves call a celebrity![VAR 0114(0042)]
It is I, Sordward![VAR 0114(0068)]
And I, Shielbert![VAR 0114(0069)]
A dandy duo of celebrities, former royalty, and— as it so happens—the sponsors of the Galarian Star Tournament![VAR 0114(0068)]
Just so it’s clear, being a sponsor means paying a jaw-dropping sum of money.[VAR 0114(0069)]
The truth is, we have both been assisting in getting this tournament off the ground for quite some time now.[VAR 0114(0068)]
This is how we seek to atone for the terrible troubles we’ve caused for the people of Galar![VAR 0114(0069)]
And naturally, we’ve been participating in the tournament too, of course.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Though it’s hardly surprising that you did not notice us, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]. We always lose in the first match for whatever reason![VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah![VAR 0114(006A)]
However, it’s getting to the point where I would like to at least have some victories to speak of![VAR 0114(0068)]
If all we do is lose, what was the point of using our considerable clout as sponsors to join in?[VAR 0114(0069)]
So, seeing as that is the situation...[VAR 0114(006A)]
you and I together are sure to be able to reach new heights of glory, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0068)]
Forgive me, Brother, but I must disagree. It is I who shall share the victors’ stand with M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0069)]
Hmm...hmm... I see, dear Brother.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Hmm...hmm...hmm... Indeed, dear Brother.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, then! Apologies for rudely interrupting from such an elevated position.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We do enjoy elevated positions so much![VAR 0114(0069)]
We look forward to a favorable decision regarding our proposal![VAR 0114(0068)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(0069)]

The repellent’s effect wore off!
The repellent’s effect wore off! Would you like to use another one?
You used [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)].
[~ 3]
It’s a sturdy-looking rock. Maybe a powerful Pokémon could break it...
[~ 5]
It’s a big heavy-looking boulder. Maybe a powerful Pokémon could move it...
...Oh?
Do you want to call Tauros?
Do you want to call Machamp?
Do you want to call Sharpedo?
There is not enough space to call this Ride Pokémon here.
You can’t ride your bicycle right now.
You can’t get down from your bicycle here.
Your Pokémon Boxes are full! Better to try again later.
You jotted down the current status on [VAR 0109(0001)].

I just can’t seem to catch a Galarian Meowth... If you’ve got a Galarian Meowth, want to trade it for my Meowth?
Wow, it’s so cute! You’re OK with trading for my Pokémon?
I see. Well, let me know if you change your mind!
Hooray! It’s the Galarian Meowth of my dreams! I’ll take such good care of it! Depending on the region, some Pokémon may have a different appearance or types!
Thanks for the Galarian Meowth! How is Cash?
Huh? You’ve only got one Pokémon! You’ll need at least two Pokémon if you want to trade.

Say, if you’ve got a Bunnelby...would you like to trade it for my Skwovet?
Oh my, you’re going to trade that one?
Oh dear, that’s too bad!
I’ll take great care of your Bunnelby! So take care of my Skwovet, too!
I’m looking after the Bunnelby you traded me with great care!
You’ve only got one Pokémon? You’ll need to have at least two in order to trade!

You got a Minccino? Interested in tradin’ it for my Cottonee?
You fine with tradin’ that Minccino with me?
No good, huh?
Thanks, mate! You just made my day! I’ll take real good care of it!
Minccino’s doin’ great! Take good care of my Cottonee!
Wait a tic. You’ve only got one Pokémon to battle with. You can only trade if you got at least two.

Toxel are so cool. I really, really want one. If you’ve got a Toxel, would you please trade it for my Togepi?
So cool! You’re really going to trade me that Toxel?
Yeah, I get it. Toxel are so cool there’s no way you’d trade me one...
Hooray! A Toxel! Just like I’ve always wanted! I promise to take good care of it!
Toxel is growing really well. Pokémon you get in trades are easy to raise.
You can’t trade if you’ve only got one party Pokémon. Please come back when you’ve got at least two.

Hey there. You happen to catch a lot of Maractus? How about trading one for my Hatenna?
You good with trading that one?
Come back if you change your mind.
All right! What a great trade! A give and take between Trainers!
A Pokémon you have a lot of might be a rare Pokémon to someone else. That’s when a trade might be in order.
You’ve only got one Pokémon, so you can’t trade. Bring some more Pokémon with you if you want to trade.

Have you caught any Yamask in Galar? If you have, would you be interested in trading for the Yamask I caught abroad?
Are you OK with trading me that Yamask?
Oh no... I’m so sad.
Hehe. What a great trade!
Is the super-rare Yamask that I caught behaving itself?
It’s kind of hard to trade when you’ve only got one Pokémon with you. Please come back when you’ve got more.

I’d really fancy catching a Vanillish, but catching Pokémon is a young person’s game, by gum. I sure would be glad if someone would trade me a Vanillish for my Throh...
Oho. You’ll trade with me?
Perhaps I’ll ask another Trainer...
Oho! Quite the splendid Vanillish, I say. You have my gratitude!
Oho! This Vanillish sure is a cute one! I want to stay with it forever!
Ah, sorry young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady, but if you want to trade, you’ll need to have at least two Pokémon in your party. Come back when you do, eh?

I’m lookin’ for a Pokémon trade. How ’bout your Obstagoon for my Kantonian Mr. Mime?
You sure you wanna trade that Obstagoon?
Right then. Come back whenever.
Thanks, mate! I’ll take really good care of your Obstagoon!
No matter whose Pokémon it is, a Pokémon can only been given a nickname once. My Mymo already has a nickname, so you’ll never be able to change it!
You don’t have enough Pokémon in your party for a Pokémon trade. You need at least two if you wanna trade...

I’m searching for a Frosmoth. You wouldn’t happen to have one, would you? If you do, I’d like for you to trade it for my Duraludon, please!
Oh! You’ll really trade me that Frosmoth!
Please come back if you change your mind.
Thank you so much! It’s just as splendid as everyone said it would be! It really gets my creative juices going!
Your Frosmoth is really energetic! It has great potential as a design model!
You can’t trade when you’ve only got one party Pokémon. Come back when you’ve got some more Pokémon with you.

Hello. Do you want to use this and awaken your Pokémon’s hidden powers?
Hidden Power changes type depending on the Pokémon that learns it. Somehow I can tell what type that move will be. If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn. Would you like to know this?
If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn. Would you like to know this?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power, the move’s type would be [VAR 0103(0000)].
The type of this Pokémon’s Hidden Power is [VAR 0103(0000)]!
If you want to know, just ask me.
I don’t think it’s possible for an Egg to use Hidden Power.
Unfortunately, this Pokémon can’t learn to use Hidden Power.

Welcome to the Nursery. How may I help you?
Nice to see a new face around here. This is a Pokémon Nursery. We take care of people’s Pokémon here. When people leave two Pokémon with us, we sometimes find Eggs. If you’re interested in that sort of thing, ask the old lady inside to tell you more. Do you want to leave any Pokémon with me?
Do come back soon.
We found your Pokémon holding an Egg. Would you like to take it?
Is that so? In that case, we’ll keep it ourselves.
You received an Egg from the Nursery worker!
Take good care of it, and raise it well.
It looks like your Boxes are all full. Have a look at them and come again, won’t you?
[VAR 0101(0000)] is doing just fine.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are doing just fine. They really seem to enjoy each other’s company.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are doing just fine. They seem to get along all right.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are doing just fine. Though... They don’t seem very fond of one another.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are doing just fine. Though... They don’t seem to like playing together at all...
I’m afraid you’d be left with too few Pokémon if I took any from you now.
You can leave up to two Pokémon with us. Which Pokémon should we look after?
We’re looking after [VAR 0102(0000)] now. Which other Pokémon would you like us to take?
It will cost 1,000 to leave two Pokémon. Would you like to leave them both?
It will cost 500 to leave one Pokémon. Would you like to leave your Pokémon with me?
That will be an additional 500, please.
Then you can trust us with both [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)]! I’ll take fine care of them.
Then leave [VAR 0102(0000)] with me.
Whenever you want to collect your Pokémon, do let me know.
You don’t seem to have enough money...
Things are going just fine. Would you like to take your Pokémon back anyway?
Just a moment, then. I’ll go get your [VAR 0102(0000)].
[~ 25]
Would you care to take [VAR 0102(0000)], too?
You don’t have many Pokémon in your party, so I can only take one from you just now.
Welcome to the Nursery! How can I help you?
Hello! This here is the Wild Area branch of the Pokémon Nursery! We’re just as capable as the Nursery on Route 5. Don’t you worry about a thing! Will you be leaving any Pokémon with us today?
Come again!
Your Pokémon was found holding an Egg! Would you like to take it with you?
If you’re sure, then I’ll keep it myself!
[~ 33]
Take good care of it, and raise it well!
It looks like your Boxes are all full. Have a look at them and come again, won’t you?

Would you care to take [VAR 0102(0000)], too?
You don’t have many Pokémon in your party, so we’ll take just one for now, all right?
I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. I help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers like you. Lately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon holding Eggs. It’s mysterious, isn’t it? If you want us to take care of your Pokémon, please speak to my sister inside the building.
Alola! [VAR 0101(0000)] is doing just fine!
Alola, Champion! [VAR 0101(0000)] is doing just fine!

Oh hey! I have surprising news for you! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! It’s like a total mystery where it came from, but you want the Egg your Pokémon was holding, right?
You received the Egg from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh, your party is full... Please come back again after making space for the Egg.
I’ll keep it if you don’t want it, but you want it, don’t you?
Then I’ll take it. Thank you.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. We can take up to two of your Pokémon.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. What would you like to do?
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. Champion, what would you like to do?
OK. Come back another time.
Oh, my little sister was looking for you!
If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won’t be able to battle. Please come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don’t be silly. That’s an Egg!
All right. I’ll take care of your [VAR 0101(0000)] for a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon. Would you like to leave one more Pokémon?
You have very energetic Pokémon, don’t you? Do you want to take one back?
[~ 81]
If you want your [VAR 0101(0000)] back now, it will cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)].
You don’t seem to have enough money...
You took back your [VAR 0101(0000)] from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Do you want to take the other one back, too?
Oh... If you leave a Pokémon with me, you’ll be left with only the one. Catch some more Pokémon and come back.
Your party is full! Make room, and then come see me again.
I’d like to leave Pokémon
I’d like to take my Pokémon back
Never mind
Is everything OK?

I’m the game director! The Rotom Dex is pretty fun, isn’t it? If you manage to fill in some of your Pokédexes, come and show me, would you?
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Whoa! You’ve registered all the Pokémon that can be found on Melemele Island!
You did it! Congratulations! You completed the Melemele Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Yikes! You’ve gone and found all the Pokémon for Akala Island!
Amazing! Congratulations! You completed the Akala Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Oho! You’ve got every Pokémon that can be found on Ula’ula Island here!
That’s just like you! Congratulations! You completed the Ula’ula Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Oh, wow! You’ve registered all the Pokémon for Poni Island!
That’s superb! Congratulations! You completed the Poni Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! Now what is that invigorating expression you’ve got on your face? Could it be? Are you here to show me a Pokédex? ... ... ... Oh! Whoooaaa! No way! You’ve completed the entire Alola Pokédex! It’s amazing! Amaza-laz-a-ling! You’re too much! Cannot compute!
This is really truly an astounding feat! Congratulations on completing the Pokédex!
Phew! There! I’m glad I didn’t mess up the stamp. And...it looks like your Trainer Passport leveled up, too! Come see me again anytime if you manage to fill in another Pokédex!
Phew! There! I may have stamped that one a bit harder than necessary, but I couldn’t seem to help it! I feel honored that I get to help a great Trainer like you celebrate your achievement!
I’m the game director! Hey, it’s you again! The master of the Alola Pokédex! Now that you’ve filled in your entire Pokédex, have fun visiting lots of different facilities and places with your Pokémon. Enjoy Alola! And get along with your Rotom Dex, too! Thanks again for playing!
I’ll go ahead and give you a new stamp to commemorate completing a Pokédex! Here we go! Bam!
All right, then! I’m going to give your Trainer Passport the super-special stamp I’ve been holding back this whole time! Here we go! Bam!
I really want to reward you somehow for your mastery in Pokédexing! Let’s see what I can dig out of my pocket... Boy, I feel like a Picker-Upper! My Secret Base was Gold Rank, by the way. And...ta-da! It’s a Shiny Charm! Just having one of these makes it more likely that you’ll encounter Shiny Pokémon!
And that’s not all! Here’s a little something special that would go well on a tireless Trainer like you, who’s been running all around Alola to fill your Pokédex!
You received a set of the Karate Gi Jacket and Karate Gi Pants!
And that’s not all! Here’s a little something special that would go well on a veteran Trainer like you, who learned Alola inside and out to fill up your Pokédex!
You received a set of a Pokémon Center Nurse Cap, a Pokémon Center Nurse Top, and a Pokémon Center Nurse Skirt!

It’s a plant with a gentle fragrance. Pokémon probably like it, too.
When the fireplace isn’t in use, Pokémon come in and out through the chimney.
It’s a fridge with some scratches on it. Did Pokémon try to open it?
There are a lot of books that look difficult to understand. Some of them are collections of Professor Magnolia’s research.
Do what plants would want instead of what you want. If you keep that in mind, plants will grow.

Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center! Still hard at work today, are you? Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Morning, Champ! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, Champ! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center! Still hard at work today, huh, Champ? Would you like to rest your Pokémon?

We hope to see you again!
Happy birthday! I hope you’ll keep visiting the Pokémon Center for many years to come! Now, would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches itself to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
Happy birthday, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you. Each and every day!
Oh, today is a special day! I know it’s a day early, but happy birthday!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center whenever your Pokémon’s HP is getting low. And if you’re planning to go far off the beaten path, you should probably remember to stock up on Potions from the Poké Mart, too. Good luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!
Oh, you’re back, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Looks like you and your team are tuckered out. You should have a nice rest while you’re home. ... ... ... ... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now, that’s more like it! You and your Pokémon should be all rested and ready for anything! Be sure to take care of your Pokémon when their HP gets low and they’re too tired to battle.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ll heal up your Pokémon!

[VAR 0100(0000)]. Prepare yourself, for I shall now use my psychic powers to Teleport you to the top with me![VAR 0114(0072)]
That was a truly elegant battle, wouldn’t you agree, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I am trusting you to continue in this elegant vein.[VAR 0114(0072)]
My Future Sight told me that we would come this far together! Now, let us bear witness to what is yet to come as well![VAR 0114(0072)]
You really knew what you were doing when you chose me as a partner, didn’t you? Hee hee! Let’s melt down our rivals into itty-bitty pieces![VAR 0114(0071)]
You know, you and me make a better combo than I would’ve expected! If you like, maybe we can keep teaming up even after the competition, too.[VAR 0114(0071)]
I’m so excited that my whole body’s shaking... [VAR 0100(0000)]! We’re gonna rip victory away from the competition, you hear?![VAR 0114(0071)]
Woo-hoo! I can’t believe little ol’ me gets to battle alongside Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s have some fun until we’ve won![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just what I’ve come to expect from you! You’re just the sort of student I can entrust all my secrets to—even my secret game exploits![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’ve finally reached the tippy-top! Let’s have the time of our lives giving all the spectators in the stadium the time of their lives![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hey, Chief! I’ve gotta say—I’m chuffed you chose me! Not sure if I can keep up with a Champ like you, but I’ll try not to hold you back! Gahahaaa![VAR 0114(0076)]
That first match went off without a hitch! Let’s roll right over ’em in round two, too. My darlin’ Nia said she’d come watch, so I’ve gotta make sure she sees her papa at his best![VAR 0114(0076)]
No surprises there, eh? You and me, we’re a match made in legend! Let’s keep it turned up to a hundred till we’ve seen this all the way through, Chief [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! With you and me battling side by side, we’re sure to be the greatest thing Galar has ever seen! Let’s ensure everyone has a good time by making this the greatest tournament ever![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m seeing even greater strength from you than you’ve shown me before, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I was so pumped up that I nearly had Charizard attack your team by accident![VAR 0114(0004)]
Looks like we’ve reached the pinnacle of our champion time together! [VAR 0100(0000)]! This is it! The greatest final match ever![VAR 0114(0004)]
Seriously? Wasn’t there anyone else willing to partner with you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
At least you won’t hold me back in battle, like most of these other Trainers would have done.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The final match, is it? It doesn’t really matter, though. Winning with you at my side won’t prove my strength to anyone.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thanks for choosin’ me for this tournament. Morpeko seems real pleased to get to battle alongside your team, too.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’ve been workin’ on really polishin’ up my skills lately, since I’m a Gym Leader now an’ all that. I won’t let you steal the spotlight this whole battle, even if you are the Champion![VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m really lookin’ forward to gettin’ to share this win with you. That’s why there’s no way we’re losin’ here in the final round![VAR 0114(000D)]
It’s quite the honor, getting handpicked by the reigning Champion. So let’s have a great time together, taking it nice and slow.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Everyone out here is really strong. I guess I can’t let my guard down just yet! But I’m not too worried. No matter who I’m up against, I’ve got you with me, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
We’re finally here at the end. Let’s throw everything we’ve got at our last opponents and bowl ’em over![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve got to admit, it feels a bit strange teaming up together with you like this. I mean...I’m happy to get to battle alongside you, but you’re just too good. You know?[VAR 0114(000F)]
What did you think of our graceful Water-type moves? I’ve worked to refine them to their purest form. I’ll be firing them off from beside you in the next match, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
When you and I team up together, there’s no way we can do anything but win. So once you’re ready, let’s go and do just that.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You are both my partner and my rival in this contest! I will expend my strength as much as I am able to at your side—while learning from your example![VAR 0114(0010)]
That last battle raged hotter than even flame. But we can’t be reduced to ash just yet. We need to burn even brighter before it’s over![VAR 0114(0010)]
The flames of my strength... They have been fanned by your wind, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! Having made it this far, there is nowhere left for us to go but the very top![VAR 0114(0010)]
Wantin’ to pair up with someone like me... I won’t pretend like I know what you’re up to. Dynamaxin’ my Pokémon’s still off the table, but I’ll do whatever else I can in this battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m not even a Gym Leader anymore or anything. But thanks to you, it seems like I’m still gettin’ in plenty of tough battles, huh?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well. Looks like we made it all the way to the end. So what? Nothing to worry about. This’ll be a walk in the park for you and me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
This...is...brilliant! You and me, kid... We’re gonna be the greatest tag team in history. I feel a bit sorry for the others. They don’t even stand a chance—because we’re sure to win this![VAR 0114(0017)]
Anyone facing off against the great Raihan and [VAR 0100(0000)] is done for! And no need to worry—I’m recording the whole thing with my Rotom Phone to post later. Speaking of which... Try to smile a bit more in the next match, would you?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Naturally we blew right past the second round! You really are something, [VAR 0100(0000)]... There aren’t many who can keep up with me. When we win, we’ve definitely got to snag a sweet selfie together to commemorate this![VAR 0114(0017)]
Thank you very much for inviting me to join you. I will use all my skill to try to live up to your expectations, so let us begin at once.[VAR 0114(0011)]
One has to be careful not to let a single victory lull oneself into complacency. But at the same time, being able to battle with you... It feels so right and...comfortable.[VAR 0114(0011)]
We finally face our greatest challenge, which will decide whether we taste victory or defeat. Let us do our best to align our moves and attacks even better than we ever have before![VAR 0114(0011)]
You may be the Champion and all, but I don’t plan to sit back and let that decide this match. I’m going to show everyone the brilliance of the Rock type—in that sense, I’ll even beat you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That last battle... Well, you conducted yourself just as I would have expected, Champion. If you hadn’t, you wouldn’t have been worthy as my partner.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hah... So we come to the end at last. Be careful you don’t slip up. All it takes is one pitfall for a battle to end in disaster. Let’s finish this up before it comes to that.[VAR 0114(0014)]
A...are you really sure you wanted m-me to be your partner?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Umm... Let’s...er...let’s do it again![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]... L... L... Let’s win this tourney![VAR 0114(0012)]
Looks like someone needs to chill. You want the power of my ice to slide to victory? Don’t worry—we’ll have these weak opponents trembling before us![VAR 0114(0015)]
Just what I expected of you, Champion! This is going to be fun, battling with you. Let’s bring the temperature down even lower. I won’t lose here, so take care you don’t freeze![VAR 0114(0015)]
You’ve done well, battling so many times in a row. One more match till we win the whole thing! You sure you have it in you? I won’t let you live it down if you drop the ball because you’re too tired![VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, well, well, well, WELL! Young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]! What an honor to have been chosen by you. I am gratitude personified, as you can surely see! Anyone fool enough to take on a pair of celebrities such as ourselves shall soon be tasting our dust as we outstrip them![VAR 0114(0068)]
How very like you, your glorious Champion-ness! No matter where you go, there are none who can stand up to your majesty! I wonder whether my earnest but incomparable team has been any help to you at all.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Only one step remains for us to take before victory lies within our hands! When you consider yourself ready, let us bring this tournament to a glorious finale![VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well, well, WELL! Young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]! It is an honor to have been chosen by you. I am terribly indebted to you for this boon. Just you wait and see—I will prove to you that I am just as capable a battler even when not paired with my older brother! Because that is what a true celebrity does![VAR 0114(0069)]
I am all aflutter with delight at being able to share such a victory with you, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]! It seems it was worth all the training we put in as we toured the region apologizing for our celebrity-scale misdeeds![VAR 0114(0069)]
The final round is all that awaits us now! Our victory is practically assured! Fate has made us a sweet promise, and she surely will not betray us now! It will pain my heart slightly to seize a victory such as none my older brother shall ever grasp...yet a true celebrity never lets such feelings show![VAR 0114(0069)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Thanks for calling me, mate. I know I’ve been spending all my days hitting the books, but I think it’s actually taught me more about battling, too! Let’s make this a tournament that’ll bring smiles of delight to everyone’s faces![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s our Champion of Galar for you! You’ve gotten even stronger since the last time we battled, haven’t you? To think that I got to learn and battle alongside someone like you, [VAR 0100(0000)]... It’s really been the best thing in my life, and nothing makes me prouder.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Here we are at the final round! I’ll wring out every bit of strength I’ve got in me. After all, it wouldn’t do to be the one to blame for making Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] lose![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t have any intention of outstaying my welcome, you understand. But if you young ones insist that you need my help, then I can hardly ignore your pleas.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yes, yes, well done. You seem to be coming along quite well. You’re precisely what I’ve come to expect in a Champion—even if you are sadly lacking in pink. Let’s keep it up, and we’ll reach the top.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s obviously no fluke that you managed to defeat that young Leon. Even partnering up with a retired old woman like myself isn’t slowing you down, is it? Win this whole thing, and I’ll even offer you my heartfelt congratulations.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Fugaaa! Fugagaga! I’m a Pokémon! Have a battle with me!
Listen for a second. Scorbunny and Sizzlipede are different species, but they’re still both Pokémon. Scorbunny and I are different species, just like Sizzlipede and I are different, too. If you think about it that way, there’s no problem with calling me a Pokémon. I don’t mind.
What? You don’t have to worry about me. Even I know it’s pretty lofty logic. I...I wanted to become a Pokémon once.
You can be one
Well...good luck with that
Hey, I’ve got it! A change of fashion style could change the way I feel, too! Basically, if I can make myself feel the way a Pokémon does, it’d be like I became a Pokémon, don’t you think?
You! Would you please put on some clothes with a fiery spirit that embodies my burning feelings?
I appreciate you encouraging me, but I can’t feel like a Pokémon that way. Please! Show me some clothes with a Fire-type design!
What’s this? Is that...? I feel like I’ve completely become a Pokémon. Wearing a hot, fire-styled outfit can make you feel different. I feel like I’ve become a Fire-type Pokémon!
Thanks for cheering me up! It’s hardly a proper reward, but I hope you like it anyway. Acrobatics is a move that does more damage if the user isn’t holding an item!
I’ve been thinking... If a Cramorant swallowed me, and then someone else caught it... Would I be able to go inside the Poké Ball, too? If I did, I’d be the first person in humanity’s history to be caught by a Poké Ball. “Gotcha! A man was caught!” They’d have to say something like that, right? Basically that means I’d equal a Pokémon, no? Yeah. Yeah, definitely “no.”

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you look a little more Champion-like, huh? Only a little, though.[VAR 0114(000D)]
What’re you gawkin’ at? It’s exactly what you think. I look wicked as a Gym Leader, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I wanna show everyone that even if you can’t Dynamax, you can still use other tactics and have a lot of fun![VAR 0114(000D)]
C’mon, Champ! How ’bout an exhibition match?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Of course!
Now’s not a good time
Don’t get the wrong idea! This ain’t you usin’ me for trainin’. I’m usin’ you for trainin’—got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sure, that’s it. Spikemuth’s my home turf, after all. It’s only natural you’d feel nervous.[VAR 0114(000D)]
As expected. You’re a proper Champion, ain’tcha, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000D)]
OK! I’m gonna give you somethin’ important. So keep it safe or I’ll get mad, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come back any time you’re free. I don’t mind trainin’ against you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just couldn’t stay away, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Guess it can’t be helped. Shall I beat you hollow?[VAR 0114(000D)]
If I’m not good enough to beat you yet, that means I definitely can’t go sayin’ I’ve surpassed my bro![VAR 0114(000D)]
Battling the Champion sure is excitin’! Be sure to come back again, OK? Morpeko and I will be waitin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]

A treasure lies buried somewhere in Turffield...
According to this treasure map, the trick to finding the treasure lies in the standing stones. “Seek yourself three standing stones, with Grass before the other ones. Use well that strength, and find then the strength of its strength in the end. Dally not, if you’ve a mind To find what time has left behind.” ...That’s what it says, but I can’t make heads or tails of it!
What?! You actually managed to find treasure?! That’s amazing! I was completely stuck!
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Grass.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Water.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Fire.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Flying.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Poison.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Dark.”
There’s something buried in the ground!

You’ll run into stronger wild Pokémon the farther you go into the Wild Area. If you feel like you’re in a pinch during a battle, just use a Poké Doll!
No matter how strong a Pokémon is, you’ll be able to catch it eventually, so long as you join in the Gym Challenge and gather the Gym Badges!

It’s a Toxel! A real Toxel! I found an Egg, and carried it around with me— and it hatched into a Toxel! Why don’t you raise it? It’s a real shocking Pokémon!
Tox tox!
And take these, too! They’ll help your Pokémon grow if you use them!
Eggs are found at Pokémon Nurseries! Exp. Candies are found from Max Raid Battles! And you’ve found yourself a real nice friend today, wouldn’t you say?

Would you like to test your knowledge about type matchups?
OK. So here’s the first question!
[VAR 0103(0001)]-type moves are super effective against which type of Pokémon?
[VAR 0103(0002)]
Ding ding ding! Right answer!
Bzzzzzz! That’s incorrect!
The next question!
Please try again.
You got [VAR 0200(0004)] out of [VAR 0200(0003)] question[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s right!
You understand Pokémon type matchups very well!
You have some understanding about Pokémon type matchups.
You may want to learn about Pokémon type matchups a little bit more...
You got them all correct for the first time. So I’ll give you a present!

Oho... I see you’ve become the Champion. Then I can now have your Lv. 100 Pokémon undergo Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I have undergo Hyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to undergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR 0102(0001)] is already so strong, it doesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?
Which stat should I hype up?
[VAR 0109(0000)]: [VAR 0201(0001)]
Quit
The training starts now!
This Pokémon can’t be trained any further!
You don’t have enough [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0000)]...
Phew... [VAR 0102(0000)] got stronger from the Hyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more Hyper Training?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?
Come back when you’re ready to get hyped for some Hyper Training.

Hee hee hee! This month’s birthday horoscope is spot on!
Hmmm? Do you want me to tell you your fortune, too?
OK! In that case, can you tell me the month you were born?
Next, I need to know what day you were born!
Oh, OK! Well, let me know if you change your mind!
I got it!
So your birthday is [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)]?

Congratulations, Champion. Here, I’ve got a little something for you as celebration.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Magnolia! Why, you didn’t have to come all this way![VAR 0114(0008)]
After everything [VAR 0100(0000)] has achieved, it’s really the least I could do.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Wishing Stars that make Dynamaxing possible are parts of Eternatus. And when Eternatus was awakened, Dynamax energy flooded the entire region...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Because of that, Dynamax Pokémon were popping up all over, causing trouble across all of Galar. But [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser friends came to our rescue.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Dynamax phenomenon has long been an important part of Galarian culture. I hope everyone will use the power of Dynamaxing correctly in the days to come.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, young [VAR 0100(0000)]. Please, do what you believe is best.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Poor Professor Magnolia... It seems she’s quite bothered by the chairman’s actions, since she helped carry out so much of the researching into Dynamaxing for him.[VAR 0114(0008)]

The Pokémon band, the Maximizers, is amazing live! Want to watch?

No, thanks
They can actually get pretty into it, so the performance might run pretty long! You still want to watch their concert?

I think I’ll pass
They’re the max of the max, right? The Maximizers are wicked!
Right then! Come back if you want to get maximized!

Welcome to the Battle Café.
Hm? You’ve already battled today, haven’t you? Please come back tomorrow.
You can battle here once a day! If you win, we’ll give you a treat, on the house! Do you want to battle?
Okeydokey! Let’s have a break!
That was a battle as refreshing as a glass of Moomoo Milk!
That was a battle as exquisite as a glass of Lemonade!
That was a battle as smooth as a cup of Tapu Cocoa!
That was a battle as exciting as a glass of Pinap Juice!
That was a battle as elegant as a cup of Roserade Tea!

We have adopted the Double Battle rules here. Please come back with two or more Pokémon with you.
We look forward to your next visit.

Well now, what’s this? I see you have a Rotom Phone and a bike... That means you must already know that the Pokémon Rotom absolutely loves to jump into all sorts of different motors! If you want to find out how a Rotom enters motors, then try to best my very own Rotom!
You’re not interested in Rotom...? Really? Do such people even exist...?
Prepare to be confounded by all the various forms of my dear Rotom!
You defeated every one of my Rotom... You should be able to put this catalog to good use!
If you use the Rotom Catalog, it will let Rotom enter all sorts of home appliances! Oh, and of course, Rotom can get out again.

Evolution is a bit tricky for Pokémon Trainers... If a Pokémon evolves, it’ll get stronger, but its appearance will change. Do you want to know how to make your Pokémon strong without it evolving?
Oh, that’s too bad. If you change your mind, please come back.
OK. I’ll teach you while battling! Let’s have a Pokémon battle!
Even though my Dottler hasn’t evolved yet, it was hard to take down, wasn’t it? The secret is this Eviolite!
If you let a Pokémon that can still evolve hold this Eviolite, that Pokémon’s Defense and Sp. Def will go up!

You and your Pokémon...have the potential to become great friends! If you have your Pokémon hold this item, your friendship may grow even stronger!
Have a Pokémon hold the Soothe Bell, and that Pokémon will grow friendly faster than normal.

Oh, you’re a Pokémon Trainer! Here, let me give you something nice. Try using it on your Pokémon!
TRs are vintage! You can use them to have your Pokémon learn rare moves! They break after one use, too, which is also extra old-school!

Why, hello there, young man. Are you interested in weather?
Why, hello there, young lady. Are you interested in weather?
Oh, is that so! Well then, let me get started...
If the sunlight is harsh during battle...
Fire-type moves become more powerful, while Water-type moves are weakened!
The sunlight will thaw out any frozen Pokémon, and they’ll be immune to being frozen while the weather lasts, too!
Moves that use light, like Solar Beam, can be performed in one turn!
The effects of some other moves also get enhanced, like those of Growth and Synthesis.
Certain moves, like Thunder or Hurricane, become less accurate.
If it’s raining during battle...
Water-type moves will become more powerful, while Fire-type moves get weakened!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, also get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, moves like Thunder or Hurricane will become sure hits!
If it’s hailing during battle...
any Pokémon that’s not Ice type will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, the move Blizzard will become a sure hit.
If a sandstorm is raging during battle...
Rock-type Pokémon get a boost to their Sp. Def!
Any Pokémon that’s not Rock, Ground, or Steel type will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
Whew! I got a little carried away there!
Thanks for listening so politely. Please, take this!
You’re the first one to listen to everything I had to say about weather... Here’s a little something extra, just as a thank-you!
I’ve gone and tired myself out. Come back tomorrow if you’re interested.
Oh, I see...

Thank you for choosing my Flying Taxi! Please take this TM as a token of my gratitude for your patronage!

The sounds of scratching glass or screeching noises feel like they suck the energy right out of you, don’t they? Take this TM—it can cause that kind of effect.
Screech... It’d be awful if you heard a screeching sound like that in the middle of the night.

So, that means the culprit must be among us![VAR 0114(0042)]
Wait... Who are you?![VAR 0114(0042)]
After all the trouble of deducing things, don’t go messing it up now![VAR 0114(0042)]
*sigh* We’re accused of being criminals... Will you help us out?
I just want to be let go soon...
Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
*cough* I suppose I should introduce myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Howses. Yes, THAT Howses—the great detective. I’ve been hired by the hotel.[VAR 0114(006D)]
At present I have cornered the culprit of a most heinous crime.[VAR 0114(006D)]
And that crime is...[VAR 0114(006D)]
the strange case of who ate the large quantity of Berries in the lobby![VAR 0114(006D)]
I’ve gathered the three people who were present in the lobby at the time of the crime...[VAR 0114(006D)]
But because of the noise, my marvelous deductive reasoning seems somewhat muddled at present...[VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s it! You, interfering child! You will be my assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Listen to the stories of each suspect, and find the culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
Looks like you were unlucky enough to get caught up in this, too...
It was a huge pile of Berries in the lobby, right? There’s no way I could’ve eaten that many. I’ve been saying that this whole time.
That detective sure seems like trouble, doesn’t he?
I will admit that I saw the mountain of Berries, but my doctor told me to stop eating those things. I’ve got it in writing right here.
*sigh* Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
Huh? Berries? I didn’t eat them. Hey, you haven’t seen my Pokémon around here, have you?
Chewww!
Ah! My Pokémon! Where were you?
Muuunch.
It sure has a lot of Berry juice on its mouth...
Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(006D)]
After listening to everyone’s accounts, I have deduced the culprit.[VAR 0114(006D)]
Dancer! You are the culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? Why me?
Because you’re a dancer! You move and shake your body so much that you needed all that food for extra energy![VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s evidence as clear and sharp as the leek of a Farfetch’d![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? What does that even mean? You’re no detective—you’re a fraud!
Wh-who are you calling a fraud?! You can’t be referring to me, the great detective![VAR 0114(006D)]
I can’t deal with this disrespect! I leave it to you! You find the culprit!
*gasp*[VAR 0114(006D)]
Fraud detective... It’s so cruel, I might cry...[VAR 0114(006D)]
You think I’m the criminal, too?!
You’re a fraud, too! A fraud assistant to a fraud detective!
Good, you get it.
What? You think I’m the culprit?
Sorry, but you’re totally wrong. I’ll do you a favor and keep that a secret. Let’s pretend that didn’t just happen, OK?
I can’t eat Berries, after all.
Wha?! You think I’m the culprit?
You’re wrong! Think things over more carefully!
Oh!
Cromch?
Could this be the culprit?
Munch...
What? That Skwovet is the one responsible?[VAR 0114(006D)]
Muuunch?
Ah, it’s true! It’s got Berry bits around its mouth!
Oh, you’re right. I see it now that I look more closely.
Yes, it definitely ate the Berries. Definitely...
Muuuncha.
As...[VAR 0114(006D)]
As... As expected of my assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Here! Recompense for solving this mystery! Take it![VAR 0114(006D)]
Splendid, just splendid! I’m overjoyed![VAR 0114(006D)]
I must be off now. Take care, everyone![VAR 0114(006D)]
Hey, you! Wait just a minute!
Hahaha! I guess I’m supposed to chase after him, too.
Muuunchaaa!
Thanks for solving the case! Skwovet is saying you did good, too.
Cheeew.

Here, let me give you these Hi-tech Earbuds! Oh, no need to thank me—it’s just a whim.
Do you know what’s so “Hi-tech” about the Hi-tech Earbuds? When you put them in your ears, they actually let you control the sounds of your surroundings! You can even make them stop specific sounds, like Pokémon cries!

What do you think about my secret beach? It’s a small mysterious paradise located on the very cool ocean. You’ve come all the way here, so I’ll give you a present.
The move Dive... Your Pokémon won’t be hit by attacks while it’s diving in the water. That’s right... It may be similar to my beach, which is so cold that nobody visits.
It certainly is a beach... But it’s just too cold!

H-hello there... You look like someone I might trust...
You see, there’s someone I fancy and I...I... I’ve written him a love letter!
Do you think you might deliver it for me?
Of course
Certainly not!
Oh, right... Sorry for asking such a strange thing of you...
D-did you change your mind, perhaps? Will you deliver my letter for me?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! I’m so glad I found someone like you to help me!
My name is Paula. Here you are. This is the letter I want you to deliver!
Deliver it to Frank for me, won’t you? Frank in Ballonlea. That’s who you want.
Please make sure the letter reaches Frank. Frank in Ballonlea. You’ll find him, won’t you?
Frank? That’s my grandda’s name.
You’re looking for Frank? That’d be me, yes...
What’s this? You’ve got a letter addressed to me?
You handed the Old Letter to the old man.
Now who could be sending me letters? Oh! Why, this says it’s from Paula!
That does take me back ages... Paula was the name of a girl I spent all my time playing with when I was a young lad...
She fell ill. Didn’t tell me, though. She kept it a secret just how sick she was.
We ended up having a great row about it... Then I moved away not long after that fight. I never met her again after the day I left.
How was she? Did she look well? Dear old Paula...
She looked well
... ... ...
That’s a comfort to hear.
What? The quiet type, are you? Meowth got your tongue?
I reckon I ought to give you something for this gift you’ve brought. For you’ve brought me back a piece of my youth.
Do you have a dear friend in your life? Make sure you treasure those dear to you while you have them close.
What’s this? You found something lying on the ground...
Finding your way through Glimwood Tangle is a fair sight easier if you give the mushrooms a li’l nudge to light them up.
Every time I meet granny Opal, she tells me I should wear more pink, the old bat.
My grandda seems to have a bit more spring in his step lately. Thanks for bringing whatever was in that letter!
Thank you...for delivering the letter...

Ta-da! You took the time to talk to a Poké Ball, so you deserve a little reward!
In case you were wondering, I’m not just any old Poké Ball! But then who am I, you ask? Well, the answer is simple. They call me the Ball Guy!
I’ll be rolling around stadiums here and there, so if you see me, don’t be shy! Come up and say hi!
Hi there, Champion! I’ve been waiting for you!
If I can become mates with the Champion, then maybe I can finally become the official mascot of the Gym Challenge...
Oh, before I forget! You were able to become Champion thanks to my cheers, right? So, here’s something to make sure you don’t forget your old friend Ball Guy!
A super-rare League Card! You’ll be the envy of every collector out there, I promise you!
Don’t worry about the card’s slight wrinkling. That’s just because everyone tried to get their hands on it! I know it looks like a common one, but mark my words—it’s a true treasure of a League Card!
Hello there! It’s your good friend Ball Guy! Don’t you worry—I’ll always make sure every Gym Challenger has a ball! It’s my duty as the volunteer mascot of the Gym Challenge!

I noticed something shiny on the ground while I was wandering the Wild Area, and so I went to investigate. Guess what I found? Star Pieces! A whole bunch of them! Here, you can have one, too!
You can sell Star Pieces for a good price at the Poké Marts. I’ve got my eye on some new clothes and a new hat already!

Ahhh... My delivery guy caught a cold and can’t make it today.
You’re the one who dined here with Chairman Rose, right? Would you please help us deliver some food?
Oh, sorry for asking something so strange.
Thank you! I truly appreciate it!
As for where to deliver the food... Sorry, I forgot to ask for an address.
I heard a clickety-clack sound from the phone. Maybe that’s a clue as to where to go?
Thanks for delivering the food. Here—something for your trouble.
Come back sometime for more work!
Back again? I wanted to ask you to deliver some food again. Is that OK?
I don’t know if this helps, but I think I heard a Pokémon cry over the phone. Like...
The customer told me to look for a green roof, but I wonder if there is such a house in Hulbury.
Thank you for taking care of all the deliveries. You really helped us out.
This is a little token of my gratitude. Please take it.
Welcome! Oh, it’s you. Please relax and stay as long as you’d like.
Oh, are you delivering my food? Thank you for your trouble! This restaurant’s dishes are full of seafood and so delicious!
I’ve already paid the restaurant, so I’ll give you candy as a tip!
For someone so young, you sure are a hard worker!
Ah! I’m starving! Oh, I can smell the ocean. You’re from the restaurant, aren’t you? I’ve been drooling while waiting for the food! Thank you for delivering the food!
You get energy from food! You should eat balanced meals!
You’re delivering food? Well, hey! I’m the one who ordered it! The tail curry of this restaurant has a unique flavor. I love it! Say hi to the manager for me!
It was easy to spot the green roof, wasn’t it?
Swiiirl.
You received the ordered food.
You handed over the ordered food.

Psst. Hey, you. You heard the rumor?
I have
I haven’t
Y-you have, huh? I mean, I don’t really care or anything...
What? You haven’t heard?!
There’s a rumor that if you give the one you like an Applin, you’ll be together forever!
Actually, the truth is, there’s someone I like.
She’s gonna move overseas pretty soon...
I’ve been searching for an Applin so I can get my feelings across the right way. But I can’t find one...
If you’ve got an Applin, would you please give it to me?
Oh, OK... Sorry to ask for something so weird. Guess I’ll look a little more on my own.
Whoa! You mean you’ll really give me an Applin?
[VAR 0100(0000)] handed over Applin!
Wow! I did it! I finally got an Applin!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Since you went through the trouble of giving me an Applin...
I’ve got to tell her how I feel!
Sorry I’m late. What was it that you needed to talk about so suddenly?
I... Err... H-how’s your packing going?
Pretty much everything’s been packed.
Since I’m moving away tomorrow...
Yeah...
H-hey! Check out this Pokémon!
Oh, an Applin! Amazing! Did you catch it?
W-well...
N-no. Someone gave it to me.
I’m sorry! I really wanted to give you an Applin that I caught on my own! But, well...
Ah, just forget it! I can’t give you this Applin.
You’re right. I can’t take it.
Yeah...
Even if we’re separated and far away from each other...
I’ll still be waiting...for an Applin you caught yourself.
Wait—do you mean...?
Ah, um... I’ll, uh—I’ll see you later!
Say, what do you think that was about, just now? Do you think it meant that...?
Good on you!
Congratulations!
Th-thank you?
Wait! Does that mean what I think it means?!
Really, really?! I can’t believe it! Woo-hoo!
Ah, sorry! I just never thought that we both felt the same way.
Right, well, I’d better give this Pokémon back to you.
You got back your Applin!
Here, take this, too. Think of it as a reward for helping me take that first step.
I’m going to catch an Applin all by myself!
And then, someday, I’m going to go give her that Applin!
Yeah! I’d better get searching for an Applin!
Thanks again, mate. See ya!
Uh... I appreciate you wanting to help me out, but maybe you should make sure you actually have an Applin?

I hope you’ll have another [VAR FF00(0006)]Let’s Go[VAR FF00(0000)] experience with this Pikachu, too!
The Pikachu I gave you is very special! You should try [VAR FF00(0006)]Dynamaxing[VAR FF00(0000)] it!

Mugou!
Electric Memory—on! This’ll help save on the electric bill!
Gumuuu?
Guess it really doesn’t work until Type: Null evolves. Drat...
Oh, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]. It probably goes without saying at this point, but congratulations on your victory!
To commemorate your achievements, I present you with this rare Pokémon—Type: Null!
Ah, and these, too.
[VAR 0100(0000)] received memories!
Once Type: Null evolves, its type will change depending on which memory you have it hold.
Ah, Champion! Are you taking good care of Type: Null?

Waaaaaah! My Minccino’s gone missing! What should I do?!
Can I help?
I don’t have time to help right now...
Waaaaaaaaah!
Huh? You’ll help me look for Minccino? Oh, thank you so much!
My Minccino really likes to play in the water, and it also likes the sound of whistling! I bet it’s hiding somewhere where there’s lots of water. But I can’t think of a place with lots of water here in Motostoke... It has a weird cry that sounds like “Mworp,” so if you hear that cry, try whistling!
[~ 6]
Mworp...?
It’s the missing Minccino!
Minccino went back to the boy.
[~ 10]
Minccino? No, I’m just an old man.
I come here secretly to freshen up, but I guess I’ve finally been found out!
Let me give you a little something to remember our meeting!
Now then, I must be on my way! Farewell! Ha ha ha ha!
The man went home!
That’s my Minccino!
Minccino came back! Thanks for helping me find it!
Please take this. It’s my way of saying thank you!
Minccino is my best friend. But it’s so full of energy, I can’t take my eyes off of it!

Oh... Champion. I never thought I’d run into you in the mines.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ve been doing some voluntary community service on Mr. Rose’s behalf.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Mr. Rose... A long time ago he used to work in a coal mine, you know. That’s why I’m actually happy with doing this kind of work. Yes! I’m so happy, I think I’ll give you one of my prized League Cards![VAR 0114(0007)]
You don’t need to worry... I have a hundred copies of Mr. Rose’s League Card. They’re all signed, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Champion... Thank you for stopping Eternatus. I know Mr. Rose feels the same way... But he was just so worried about the future...[VAR 0114(0007)]

Name’s Cara Liss. I am researching Fossils, huh.
Fossils in Galar are broken into top halves and bottom halves for some reason, huh. Strangely, no matter which top and bottom you combine, they can be restored together. Perhaps, within this mystery, lies the key to understanding these combinable Pokémon, huh.
Hm? You’ve got some Fossils there, huh. Will you show them to me, Cara Liss?
Don’t act so haughty.
Which of your Fossils do you think stands up to the high standards of Cara Liss?
Which of your Fossils do you think will pique the curiosity of Cara Liss?
Fossilized Bird

OK. Restoration time. Let’s unravel the mystery of these Fossils!
All right, I’ll stick ’em together! Here...we...GO!

Wow, I think you’re on your way to becoming real good friends!
Seems like you’re pretty good friends! Still, I bet you could become even closer!
You two get along great! Together is always better—am I right?

Hello there? What’s this? Did you need something from me? Riiight... Why don’t you run along for now, but come back when you’re as strong as a Champion, would you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, blow me over! You’ve become Champion? Now, that’s something worth writing home about![VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Morimoto. I’ve been waiting for a strong Trainer like you to come find me.
If you’ve got faith in your own skill, care to join me in a match?
Is that so? Well, that’s a right shame.
What’s this? Can’t battle if you don’t have at least two healthy Pokémon capable of joining in!
That’s the ticket! Now watch out! Because Morimoto’s got more than enough to motor right over you!
You’re really strong! I should’ve known!
Since you’ve managed to trounce me, I guess you’ve earned yourself a reward.
Let’s have ourselves a rematch someday!
You seem to keep motoring right over ol’ Morimoto. Let’s see who wins the next time!
I’m all tuckered out for today. How about tomorrow for a rematch?
And here [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is! Ready for that match?
And...go! Awww, I missed again?! It’s harder than it looks to get a catch! Hmm? You... You look like you’d know the proper way to throw a Poké Ball!
I’m a planner! My job is think of ways to play, so I suppose that means that playing itself is my job!
Hear that background music? Yup, I made that!
We came here to research a bit. But the Galar region is lovely, isn’t it? The best part of all had to be enjoying the different toppings on all the curries. Curry is a big hit in Kanto, too, you know!
Do you like Pokémon?
Well, thanks for that! I hope you’ll always love them!

Got some Pokémon questions? Feel free to ask away.
Undergo Hyper Training

Remember a move
Forget a move
Quit
Rate a nickname
Check a Pokémon’s memories
Well, come back anytime.
So, you’re the new Champion! I can put any of your Lv. 100 Pokémon through Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I put through Hyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to undergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR 0102(0001)] is already so strong, it doesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?

Which Pokémon should learn my move?
Which Pokémon should I have remember a move?
Which Pokémon should I have forget a move?
Hm? This move is quite rare. If your Pokémon forgets this move, it won’t be able to relearn it. So I’ll teach it another rare move for you.
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
There are rare moves that your Pokémon can’t learn by leveling up or by using TMs or TRs! If you’re interested, I can teach them to your Pokémon.
You want one of your Pokémon to forget a move? If you want your Pokémon to use a move it’s forgotten, it’ll have to relearn the move first. So be careful.
I can have your Pokémon remember any move they should’ve had the chance to learn up until where they are now.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves that it can forget.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves that it can remember.
Huh? You can’t choose an Egg! It hasn’t even hatched yet!
[VAR 0102(0001)] has already learned the special move.
Would you like me to teach this move to another of your Pokémon?
Is there another Pokémon you’d like me to help remember some moves?
Would you like me to have your Pokémon forget any other moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon forget moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon remember moves?
Shall I stop teaching your Pokémon moves?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?

Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as [VAR 0102(0000)]! You’re right—that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!
[~ 77]
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as [VAR 0102(0000)]! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is much better! How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)]! That is a truly impeccable nickname! I can’t say anything bad about it! Take good care of [VAR 0102(0000)]!
Now, now... That is merely an Egg.
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a nickname and change back to the name that the Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. [VAR 0101(0001)]! It reminds you of the time when you first met the Pokémon! Come see me again if you want to give Pokémon nicknames.
For a Pokémon you got from another Trainer, you only get one go at changing its name. It’ll be [VAR 0102(0000)] from now on and forever. So you’re sure that’s the name you want?
All right. Let me know if you change your mind.
Shall I rate another Pokémon’s name?
Which Pokémon’s memories are you interested in?
Somehow I can tell what Pokémon remember.
[VAR 0102(0000)] seems to have memories from its time with another Trainer.
Do you want to hear about the memories of any other Pokémon?

I sense great potential as a Trainer in you. But it’s still a bit early... Please come back when you become the Champion.
Eek! Champion! Do you want to teach your Pokémon the marvelous move [VAR 0107(0001)]?
See you!
Oh, Champion. The Pokémon you are with right now can’t learn this move...
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach this move to?
Sorry. [VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn this move.
An Egg can’t learn this move!
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows this move!
Which move should be forgotten?
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)] [VAR 0102(0000)] forgot [VAR 0107(0001)]! And it learned [VAR 0107(0002)] instead![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]

Hey there, Trainer! You’ve just taken your first step into the world of camping! People call me the Camping King! I can help you out with all your camping needs. Remember, everyone starts out as a rookie! If you’ve got any questions about camping, feel free to ask me!
Well, well! Today looks like another fine day for camping, I’d say!
Is there anything camping related you’d like some help with?
I want to change my tent color
Rate my Curry Dex, please
I want to change my cooking utensils
Feel free to ask me anything about camping!
I’ll pick out a color that goes well with your Pokémon!
Hmm. Hmm. Yes, I see... A color that would suit [VAR 0102(0000)]... That’s it! It must be the [VAR 0103(0001)] type’s color!
Oho. Let’s see now... A color that suits your [VAR 0102(0000)]... Which do you think is a better fit?
Yes
No
[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color
[VAR 0103(0001)]-type color
The [VAR 0103(0000)]-type color? Are you sure?!
I’ve changed your tent to the [VAR 0103(0000)]-type color!
Oh? Why, you haven’t made a single dish yet! Come back after you’ve tried making one, and show me!
You’ve reached the highest heights of curry creation! I have nothing more to teach you! Continue to strive for curry creation excellence!
How’s your Curry Dex coming along? Allow me to have a quick look at it. Looks like you’ve made [VAR 0202(0001)] kind[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of curry!
You’re still a camping rookie! For starters, why not try throwing any ingredients you like in the pot and see what comes of it!
Looks like you’re getting the hang of cooking while out camping. Try adding in Berries to your curry to give it a little extra oomph!
With ten curries under your belt, I think you’ve graduated from rookie status! Keep trying to create all manner of wonderful curries from here on out!
You’ve certainly started making your way down the long road of curry cooking! Be sure to fan the flames just right, so as not to burn the dish. And don’t spill anything when stirring the pot!
Oh! Why, you’ve made at least thirty different kinds of curry! I can feel the curry creation potential radiating from you! Keep doing your best to aim for higher and higher heights!
Seems like making curry has become a common part of your everyday life by now, right? Remember you can always buy more ingredients, as well as find them lying on the ground! Gather as many different ingredients as you can and make all different kinds of curry!
You stand now among the curry cooking elite! You probably already know this, but if you cook in someone else’s camp, there’s a chance you’ll be able to use an ingredient that wasn’t in your Bag!
That look on your face! That faint fragrance of some spice! You’ve become a truly splendid curry chef! I bet there are times you look through your Curry Dex and relive all the memories that fill it!
You’ve made every single curry I know of?! Amazing...simply amazing! You may very well complete your Curry Dex before even I do!
Oh? Oh?! Could this be? Can this truly be?! You’ve...you’ve completed your Curry Dex! You’ve made every known curry in this world to date! To have come so far in your camp cooking... I’m touched! Truly touched! Thank you!
Since you’ve made at least [VAR 0202(0000)] different kind[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s of curry, how about a reward?
You put [VAR 1300(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)] away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Fresh Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Weighted Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Soothe Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Mirror Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Tympole Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Champion Ball away in your Camping Gear.
Sausages are a staple topping! Be sure to try cooking with them!
This Fresh Ball is a new kind of Poké Ball I’ve developed... Nah, I’m just having a laugh! It’s a toy you can use to play with your Pokémon while camping. It’s the spitting image of a Watmel Berry, and it’s quite heavy, too. You might have a little difficulty throwing it!
Remember, a Heavy Ball is what you use to catch Pokémon! This might look similar, but it’s a Weighted Ball... It’s just a toy! It makes a real heavy sound as it bounces! Try playing with it when camping with your Pokémon!
The Soothe Ball makes a sound like a bell when you throw it! Try throwing it when you’re camping with your Pokémon to calm everyone’s hearts!
The Mirror Ball is ultra-reflective and the pinnacle of funkiness! Try throwing it when you’re camping with your Pokémon to get everyone pumped up!
The Tympole Ball looks like...well...Tympole. You can hear Tympole’s cute cry when the ball bounces on the ground!
The Champion Ball is a kind of gag gift with Leon’s face on it! Try throwing it when you’re camping with your Pokémon. Leon’s face will fly far and bounce with some impressive oomph!
Moomoo Cheese melts in a curry and makes a dish taste even better! Cooking with it will also help you add some new entries to your Curry Dex. So try using this ingredient next time you cook!
Everyone knows Slowpoke Tails are a delicacy! They fall off all the time and grow back quickly, so they’ve become a popular cooking ingredient! Adding it to a curry is sure to create a taste that you’ll fall in love with!
Ah, another thing...
Thank you for completing your Curry Dex! You’ve truly accomplished something marvelous! And such a cook deserves an appropriate set of cooking utensils. Please take these!
You received the golden cooking utensils!
You’re using the golden cooking utensils right now. Would you like to change back to the normal ones?

First, I’ll tell you about the mysterious dish called curry. Everyone in Galar has been hooked on it! To start, you need to mix in a Berry to make the curry! Then you cover a grain called “rice” in it! And there you have it! It’s quite literally curry with rice! But wait! There are ingredients that you can add to the dish, like toppings to better suit your tastes! You can make all sorts of magnificent curries while you’re camping! And whenever you make a new kind of curry, it’ll be automatically saved in your Curry Dex! So try making all manner of different curry recipes!
You got the Fresh Ball!
You got the Weighted Ball!
You got the Soothe Ball!
You got the Mirror Ball!

A Gym Challenger! Ah, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu, you’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in Turffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger! And you’ve even earned your first two Badges! But I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to Galar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special training with his team. You might want to head there to try to catch him.
Oh? A bit late for challenging the Gym tonight, wouldn’t you say? Come again tomorrow. If you need a place to pass the night, all Gym Challengers can stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
Let’s all do our utmost as Gym Challengers.
First stop will be Turffield, eh? I’m off for Route 3 myself!
I’ve made it this far, at least... But now I’m not sure I can make it any further. Can I really beat the Fire Gym? I don’t know...
Your Pokémon really got stuck in and did [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir best for you, didn’t [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthey... When I watched your match, I was the one who ended up feeling fired up to carry on!
The opening ceremony of the Gym Challenge... My whole family’ll be watching back home... I should go check my hair once more in the mirror, don’t you think?
Getting to see Chairman Rose address us all like that... I’ve never been so fired up in my life!
I got the Grass Badge and the Water Badge... But can I really get a Fire Badge?
You beat that Kabu fellow?! You really are a great Trainer... At this rate, I bet the other Gym Challengers will start wanting to test their mettle against you.
I heard that this year’s Gym Challengers include Trainers that were endorsed by the chairman and even the Champion!
Collecting all eight Gym Badges... It feels a bit like a treasure hunt, doesn’t it? I wonder how hard the battles will be against the Gym Leaders, though.
You’re one of those Gym Challengers that were endorsed by Leon, right? No wonder you’re up to taking on Kabu.
That’s Leon for you, isn’t it... He must’ve seen at a glance how much potential you had, and that’s why he chose to endorse you.
I’m dead nervous, and this is only the opening ceremony... What’s the matter with me?! My Pokémon all seem to be aching to battle, so why can’t I seem to feel the same way...?
I got to stand on the pitch in a stadium, just like I’ve always dreamed of doing... Next up, I’ll be battling on that pitch! No! Winning on that pitch—as the crowd goes wild!
There are heaps of us starting out like this, but only a small number will make it to the end...
Just seeing the Champion is a dream come true. But my real dream ought to be to defeat him!
Finally, the time’s come for another Gym Challenge!
Time to train up my team out on Route 3!
I’m ready for that Fire Gym Leader Kabu!
We’re not done yet. Let’s give it our all!
Everyone’s already nervous. Will we make it to the end?
I’m going to make it to the end of this—just you watch!
There are still a number of challengers in the running!
That Gym Challenger’s done better than I ever dreamed!
Hmm. So everyone here is a fellow Gym Challenger...
Everyone’s going to be competing to win this.

I’m sorry, but only challengers taking on the Gym mission can go beyond this point.

Oh? Welcome. Is there anything you’d like to know about?
Is there anything else you’d like to know about?
Here at the Pokémon Nursery, we take care of the Pokémon that Trainers leave with us. The Pokémon we look after won’t get strong, but if you leave two Pokémon with us, we sometimes find Pokémon Eggs. If you want to leave your Pokémon with us, please speak to my granddaughter outside.
If you put a Pokémon Egg in your party and carry it around, a Pokémon will hatch from the Egg. Nobody knows where Pokémon Eggs come from. They truly are mysterious...
If you want to find Pokémon Eggs, think about the two Pokémon you leave here. I recommend you leave two of the same species of Pokémon with different genders. If the species are similar, we may still find a Pokémon Egg. But it seems we never find Eggs with certain combinations of Pokémon left here.
Please come again.
Tell me about the Pokémon Nursery
Tell me about Pokémon Eggs
Tell me about what Pokémon I should leave
Nope

Looks like your sweet [VAR 0101(0001)] might be running on empty. Let’s have you rest up.[VAR 0114(0008)]
As long as you have Pokémon at your side and the energy to carry onward, you’ll naturally find that you always have a smile on your face![VAR 0114(0008)]
What a frightful situation this has become... Still, I suppose everything will be all right as long as we’ve got Leon taking care of it... And you wish to help him as well, don’t you? Don’t worry—I’m certain you’ll be of some help![VAR 0114(0008)]
I suppose there must be many demands on you, love, now that you’re Champion... But remember: the important thing is that you be the kind of Champion you want to be.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Master Ball’s guaranteed to catch any Pokémon in one try, right?! That’s amazing! I bet you’ll run into a Pokémon that’ll deserve such an amazing Poké Ball one of these days![VAR 0114(0008)]
Professor Magnolia mentioned something unbelievable the other day. She said that Dynamaxing doesn’t actually make the Pokémon itself grow bigger! But they’re still able to physically interact with others, right? They must really hold an amazing amount of power![VAR 0114(0008)]
By the way, have you been to the Battle Tower in Wyndon? Leon’s mother was saying he’s been having a proper ball![VAR 0114(0008)]

To Hop, his brother is a superhero.
Even though Leon is no longer the Champion, he’s still a superhero to Hop. Now that both are Trainers, Hop must’ve realized Leon is even greater than he’d imagined.
You know, the last time Leon came round, he actually took his time to enjoy a meal with us... It’s been ages since I’ve seen him like that! Maybe we should all get together for another barbecue again sometime!

There’s a collection of various caps.
Leon is so busy that he hardly comes home. But I would like to keep his room clean and tidy.
Although Leon is no longer the Champion, he’s still very busy and hardly comes back. But I think he should do whatever he wants to do while he’s young.
There is a Poké Ball with a Charmander in it.
You read the letter attached to the Poké Ball...

“Regarding the Changes Pokémon Can Undergo” Pokémon do not only change in appearance when they level up. They can also do so through the use of certain items or under the influence of the area they are in, in some cases. It is hypothesized that some factor within the Pokémon itself is what allows for these changes to their form and biology, but thus far, conclusive evidence of such a factor has not been found by researchers.
“What Is the Dynamax Phenomenon?” This phenomenon, in which Pokémon take on gigantic forms, has only been observed in the Galar region. Moreover, it only seems to occur in specific locations and under set conditions.
“On the Gigantification of Pokémon” While the general principal holds that Pokémon grow stronger and larger by evolving, it is also true that simply making oneself appear larger is another survival strategy with merit.
Hello again, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]. It has been a while, hasn’t it?
I’m really sorry for the part I played in driving [VAR 0101(0001)] mad back then.
Masters Sordward and Shielbert and I have been doing volunteer work to atone for what we did.
I’m grateful that Professor Sonia would still trust me to look after the lab, even though I’ve deceived her once before.
Well, one thing led to another, and I’m working here again. Don’t worry—I’ll do my best to actually help out this time. Hehe!
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Thanks for the hand back in the Crown Tundra! I’m writing up our findings now, but there’s so much to cover I hardly know where to start![VAR 0114(000B)]

When the fireplace isn’t in use, Pokémon come in and out through the chimney.

The food here is out of this world. It’s worth coming here just for this, even if it means going out of your way!
Talking about work during a meal? What are you trying to do? Ruin your own food?
This dish is cooked to perfection! It’s juicy but not overly soft, and gives you something to really bite into! I must send the cook my compliments!
I absolutely adore watching my child eat. He looks so happy and content!

Only after you master basic moves can you engage in more advanced battles. That’s what I learned from karate.
I heard that some wild Pokémon soak in hot springs to heal their injured bodies.

You’re welcome to stay at either building of Hotel Ionia.
Hotels are the best. No need to worry about cleaning or laundry or anything.
We’ve got tickets for the very-front-row seats in the stadium! Sometimes moves can come flying our way, but it’s wicked exciting!
I’m waiting for someone... My Noibat’s using its ultrasonic waves to help look.
Weeeoooeeeoooeeeooo.

Is this your first visit to the Isle of Armor?
I’m researching Pokémon biology here on this island.
You want to register the Pokémon you catch on this island to your Pokédex, right?
I’ll update your Pokédex so you can do just that.
Your Pokédex is being updated... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The Isle of Armor Pokédex has been added to your Pokédex!
When you’ve caught a lot of Pokémon on the Isle of Armor, come back and show me your Pokédex.
Do you want to show me the Isle of Armor Pokédex?
Do you want to show me your completed Isle of Armor Pokédex again?
Oh, that’s too bad.
Hee hee! Let me see.
Your current progress on the Isle of Armor Pokédex is...
[VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon seen and [VAR 0202(0001)] Pokémon caught!
Hehehe. You’ve only just gotten started on completing your Isle of Armor Pokédex! Good luck! I’m cheering for you.
Hehe! You’re still new to this island, but you’re doing well! If grass is shaking, there may be a rare Pokémon! Check rustling grass as much as possible!
What? You already caught 30 Pokémon or more? I must say you have talent. Of course, you raise your Pokémon and make them evolve as well, right? By doing so, you can fill your Pokédex!
Have you already caught 50 Pokémon? That’s incredible! I-I think you might have even filled over a quarter of your Pokédex already... Please walk around the Isle of Armor even more!
Whoa! What a talent! I bet you’ll catch over 100 Pokémon in no time! You’ve been checking Pokémon Dens, right? You can meet rare Pokémon in the dens.
Whoa! You’ve caught 100 Pokémon! I’ve been dreaming of this moment! I think maybe we’re halfway there?! Thanks to you, my research is going very well.
... ... ... ... ... ... Oh, sorry! I was mesmerized by your Pokédex ’cause it has so few blanks. I think you’re really going to complete this Pokédex! I bet you already know that weather can also influence what Pokémon you encounter, too!
I’ve never seen an Isle of Armor Pokédex that’s been filled so much! Is it because you make the most of Surprise Trades? You can also cooperate with someone to get Pokémon that are hard to collect.
Wow! You’re getting there. You’re so close to completing your Isle of Armor Pokédex! You no longer need my advice. I believe you can do it. I’ll be waiting for you!
Congratulations! You finally did it!
You completed your Isle of Armor Pokédex!
Thanks to your hard work, I made remarkable progress on my research.
I’m so glad that I asked you!
To commemorate your great achievement, let me add something special to your League Card!
Done!
I’m extremely happy! Please also take this as a token of my gratitude!
This is not something everyone can do! Thank you so much!
Hehehe! I can’t get tired of looking at this awesome Isle of Armor Pokédex! Congratulations!
Oh? That Pokémon...
Is that Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pokémon?!
It’s a Pokémon you can’t find even in the entire Galar region, let alone on the Isle of Armor.
Thank you for showing me Zarude. Please take this as a token of my gratitude!
It’s the cap of a boy who meets a lot of Pokémon during his journey. I thought it’d look nice on you.
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Do you want to give your Pokémon Max Soup?
Yep!
Tell me about Max Soup
Nope
What do you want to know about Max Soup?
Do you have any other questions? What do you want to know?
Effects of Max Soup
Pokémon that can drink Max Soup
Nothing
Which Pokémon do you want to give Max Soup to?
If you give Max Soup to a Pokémon that has great potential, it’ll become a special Dynamax Pokémon— a Gigantamax Pokémon! But if a Gigantamax Pokémon drinks Max Soup, it’ll become a Dynamax Pokémon!
If you want to know the Pokémon that have the potential to Gigantamax... My apologies, but please read the book on the shelf.
If this [VAR 0101(0001)] drinks Max Soup, it’ll become capable of Gigantamaxing!
If this [VAR 0101(0001)] drinks Max Soup, it’ll become capable of Dynamaxing!
I’ll use three clusters of Max Mushrooms to make Max Soup! Is that all right?
I’ll use three clusters of Max Mushrooms and one comb of Max Honey to make Max Soup! Is that all right?
Of course!
I changed my mind
What? You don’t want it? All right, next time.
In order to make Max Soup, I need three clusters of Max Mushrooms. If you have a Max Raid Battle, particles for Dynamax will scatter around all over the place, which helps Max Mushrooms grow in forests and caves on the Isle of Armor!
Nonobear!
Urshifu doesn’t like the taste of Max Soup and won’t drink it... It does have the potential to Gigantamax, though... I wonder why it won’t drink it.
Urshifu won’t drink Max Soup unless I put Max Honey in it! Please get three clusters of Max Mushrooms and one comb of Max Honey!
I make Max Soup once per person per day! That’s a promise I keep with Ms. Honey!
[VAR 0102(0001)] is now capable of Gigantamaxing!
[VAR 0102(0001)] is now capable of Dynamaxing!
“Pokémon that have the potential to Gigantamax and can drink Max Soup!
“Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise Rillaboom, Cinderace, Inteleon, Butterfree, Pikachu, Meowth, Machamp, Gengar, Lapras, Eevee, Snorlax, Garbodor,

“Last but not least, the Master Dojo’s secret Pokémon, Urshifu! ... ...” That’s all!

I’m completely obsessed with moves. Under the supervision of my master, I’ve been developing new Pokémon moves day and night.
I’ve spent a lot of time developing many moves.
[~ 2]
[~ 3]
I’ll teach your Pokémon a move for a small token of gratitude...
Shall I teach your Pokémon a move for five pieces of Armorite Ore?
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach a move to?
You don’t have enough Armorite Ore... I mean, gratitude.
Please obtain Armorite Ore in Max Raid Battles on the Isle of Armor.
Turning down my offer so firmly... That’s a move that children are good at.
Then I’ll take your Armorite Ore... I mean, gratitude.
If you want me to teach your Pokémon a move, come back with a small token of gratitude.

Oh! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Just the person I wanted to see! Tell me... Do you collect Watts?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Sure do!
What are those?
Of course you do! You’re such a pro at all this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Watts are a kind of energy you can collect from Pokémon Dens![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll have you know that the Watt business is positively booming right now around here.[VAR 0114(0074)]
They say that those who hold the most Watts hold the key to success![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ve actually been trying to gather up Watts to spruce up the dojo a bit, get some more gear...[VAR 0114(0074)]
But both my darling hubby and my son are more the indoor types, you know?[VAR 0114(0074)]
And it’s pretty hard for me to collect that many Watts all on my own...[VAR 0114(0074)]
If you ever happen to have some Watts to spare, [VAR 0100(0000)], I’d be glad to take them![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, but I wouldn’t ask you to give them to me and not get anything in return! This would be a business transaction, of course. I’ll reward you for your generosity![VAR 0114(0074)]
Whenever you have some extra Watts, simply come and talk to me![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What can I help you with, love?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Anything else you need from me?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m here to share some Watts!
What’s the next goalpost?
I’m ready to battle!
Nothing
If there’s ever anything I can help you with, just say the word![VAR 0114(0074)]
How many Watts could you bear to part with?[VAR 0114(0074)]
1,000 W
5,000 W
10,000 W
50,000 W
100,000 W
500,000 W
1,000,000 W
All my Watts!
Never mind
You’ll give us [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W?[VAR 0114(0074)]
You’ll give us all your Watts, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, you sweet thing. I do appreciate your wish to help, but you simply don’t have the Watts![VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], you’ve given us... [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W so far![VAR 0114(0074)]
Thank you so much! I’ll be sure to use the Watts to help develop the dojo even more.[VAR 0114(0074)]
With over [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I can afford to have a hair stylist come work here at the dojo, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this the hair salon? Yes, this is Honey from the Master Dojo. ♪ I was wondering if you could spare a stylist to come enjoy the lovely island life with us! Yes, that’s right—the Isle of Armor... Mm-hmm...[VAR 0114(0074)]
They’re sending someone right over![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, dojo! It’s lovely to meet you all! I’m your new hair stylist!
But I can’t bare all the secret arts of hair styling to you all. So when you’d like to have something done, please call on me in this room here! No cameras allowed! And no speaking of what you see inside this room!
Now that’s a real pro... True masters are always picky about their craft.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Hee! But now we can always look our best— even out here in the wilds![VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we’ve gathered over [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I can order a Rotomi terminal for the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this the Pokémon Center? This is Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪ I’d like to buy one of your Rotomi terminals for some Watts, but what do you say? Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm... Yes, that’s right...[VAR 0114(0074)]
We were able to make a deal! And I got them to send it right over at once![VAR 0114(0074)]
Though... Hmm? This doesn’t look quite right...[VAR 0114(0074)]
There’s something written on the screen here. Now let me see...[VAR 0114(0074)]
“Thank you for your purchase! To get your new Rotomi up and running, you must first install our proprietary software.[VAR 0114(0074)]
“To order your copy today, contact our sales department...at...” What![VAR 0114(0074)]
They’re simply trying to gouge us for more Watts! Of all the greedy, conniving business practices![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m awfully sorry about this, [VAR 0100(0000)]... But it looks like we’ll need a bit more of your help to get our Rotomi up and running...[VAR 0114(0074)]
And now that we’ve exceeded [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, we can finally get our Rotomi up and running![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this the Pokémon Center? Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪ Yes, again! Fancy that... We ordered a Rotomi from you a little while back... Yes, yes, it does look lovely... But we’d rather prefer it to actually WORK, too. Mm-hmm... Could you send someone right over?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Now that that’s taken care of... Let’s fire it up![VAR 0114(0074)]
Roto!
Pleazzzed to greet you, Mzzz. Honey!
Rotomi at your service! Bzzzt!
And I am delighted to hear it! I’m sure you’ll be worth every last Watt you’ve cost us... In fact, we’ll make sure of it![VAR 0114(0074)]
Our Rotomi is up and running thanks to your Watts, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
So be sure to use it plenty![VAR 0114(0074)]
And now that we’ve blown past [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, we can get a vending machine for the dojo, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this Macro Cosmos Living? Yes, this is Honey over at the Master Dojo. ♪ I was just wondering if we could get one of your lovely vending machines over here at our dojo... Yes, yes, that’s right... Of course...[VAR 0114(0074)]
*glug glug glug* Ahhhhh! That is some refreshing water![VAR 0114(0074)]
We’re able to offer the drinks at far less than the usual asking price, so I’d get all your drinks from here from now on if I were you![VAR 0114(0074)]
We’ve only got Fresh Water in stock so far, but the dojo’s services are really getting robust![VAR 0114(0074)]
With some more Watts, I can expand the lineup even further, too.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And we’ve hit [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W! We can stock Soda Pop in the vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello! Macro Cosmos Living, right? Honey from the Master Dojo here! ♪[VAR 0114(0074)]
*gulp gulp gulp* Ahhhhhh... Lovely![VAR 0114(0074)]
Soda Pop brings a little fizz and sparkle to every day, doesn’t it? And we don’t even have to leave the dojo now to get some![VAR 0114(0074)]
And there’s still more room to expand the lineup further...if we get some more Watts.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we’ve hit [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I can order in some Lemonade for the vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello, Macro Cosmos Living! Honey from the Master Dojo here! ♪[VAR 0114(0074)]
*gulp gulp gulp* Now that’s just what was needed! I’ve got such a spring in my step that I feel I’m dancing on air![VAR 0114(0074)]
A refreshing bottle of Lemonade sounds like just the thing to cool you down when you’re feeling all hot and sweaty![VAR 0114(0074)]
I think we’ve got quite the lineup of drinks now, but maybe we could use something to nosh on?[VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we reached [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I think I can arrange for regular deliveries of fresh ingredients to come here to the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello! Is this the Dream Dairy? This is Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪ Is it possible to ask for a regular delivery of your delicious products? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...[VAR 0114(0074)]
We managed to pull off a swift new contract! It took no time at all, and it’s sure to be a hit! We’ll have fresh ingredients delivered to the dojo each day now, so feel free to take your pick! Within reason, of course...you silly sausage![VAR 0114(0074)]
[~ 79]
What should I do next with all these Watts... I wonder if people would like to get nutritious drinks from a vending machine, too...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Since you’ve given us [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I’ll add some healthier drinks to our lineup![VAR 0114(0074)]
Ah, er, hello? Have I reached No. 1 Pharmacy? This is Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪ I was just thinking how much I’d love to offer your supplement drinks here... Right, right... Mm-hmm... Naturally...[VAR 0114(0074)]
You can now buy your fill of Protein and Iron right here at the dojo! This...is...AMAZING! And since we bought so many, we got bulk pricing. Good for the body...and the pocketbook![VAR 0114(0074)]
I know it’s not the whole array of supplements yet, but this is still a huge step for us![VAR 0114(0074)]
With some more Watts, I can expand the lineup even further, too.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we’ve reached [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, let’s try to get some more supplements in stock![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this No. 1 Pharmacy? It’s Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪ Thank you so much for all your support so far. In fact, we’d like to offer some more of your products here at the dojo... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Look! Look! Now we’ve got Calcium and Zinc, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
If I just raised my Sp. Atk enough, maybe I could fire off a Focus Blast or two...[VAR 0114(0074)]
And there’s still more room to expand the lineup further if we get some more Watts![VAR 0114(0074)]
So! Since we reached [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, let’s get even more supplements in stock![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello, No. 1 Pharmacy? It’s your old pal Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪ Do you think we could ask for just one more teeny tiny addition to our regular order?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Now we’ve got HP Up and Carbos for sale![VAR 0114(0074)]
If I raise my Speed a bit more, I might be able to finish my hair and makeup in just seconds![VAR 0114(0074)]
But first, I’ve got to think of another way to help the Master Dojo’s name recognition![VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we’ve got [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W now, I think we can finally negotiate to get the Master Dojo added as a League Card background![VAR 0114(0074)]
Ahem. Hello? Hello. Is this the Pokémon League? Honey here from the Master Dojo! ♪ I’ve got a plan that I think will benefit the both of us, if you might be interested... Mm-hmm... Exactly right...[VAR 0114(0074)]

That was my initial plan, anyway. But they caught us in such a random moment, didn’t they... I think we’d better just keep this a personal keepsake and not spread it about much.[VAR 0114(0074)]

I’M HERE TO BATTLE!
What?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Hey, wait. Aren’t you...?
You remember me? We met at the station when you first came to the island!
To think I might’ve been standing where you are right now if I’d only had the guts... Cripes, but that would’ve been a disaster! Letting you go to the Master Dojo in my place is the best thing that’s ever happened to me!
Thanks to my cowardice that time, I was able to join an even BETTER dojo than this old place!
The Wile Dojo!
And as the strongest, wiliest, and wildest Trainer the Wile Dojo has got...
I’m here to show the fusty old Master Dojo that it’s time you all pack up and make way for the the new hotness that’s here to replace you!
Now, now, let’s all just settle down...[VAR 0114(0074)]
You know this person, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I must say, his manners leave something to be desired. You should pick your friends more wisely.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Nobody asked you! Who are you to be judging me!
Bring out the strongest Trainer you’ve got, this instant! I’ll show you your dojo is done for!
Well, this wasn’t what I’d had in mind, but...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], but could I ask you to wait just a bit longer for that battle?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Seriously? Disappear already, would you? I’m not here to beat on somebody’s mum.
You know, love, you’re really being quite the bother here...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Wh-what?!
Hey! W-wait! Augh—!
N-no! Stop! Mercy!
NGAHHHHHHH!!!
B-but I’m the strongest person in the Wile Dojo! How could this lady have destroyed me like this?! I couldn’t even lift a finger to stop her!
You there.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Y-YES, MA’AM?!
You haven’t even mastered the basics of understanding how moves work.[VAR 0114(0074)]
You sure you don’t want to come start over from scratch at the Master Dojo?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Once we tear you down completely, I promise we’ll build you back up as a proper Trainer.[VAR 0114(0074)]

I’m about to blow your mind![VAR 0114(0074)]
Nooooooooo! Fiddlesticks! I didn’t think you’d actually be able to beat me![VAR 0114(0074)]
But at least you did get my pulse racing...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Thanks for showing me a really great time in that battle![VAR 0114(0074)]
Honestly, my darling hubby would be the first to tell you that he and I are on the same level when it comes to our strength in battle...[VAR 0114(0074)]
And yet you beat me, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You really are strong![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m sure that you’re really igniting a new fire in my darling hubby and our other students.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I don’t mean to ask too much of you, but if I might ask a bit more...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Please do carry on as a part of the Master Dojo family, and help all our family learn and grow![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, and...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I won’t let you rest on your laurels for too long, mind![VAR 0114(0074)]
Let’s have another great battle soon![VAR 0114(0074)]
Heehee! Battling you really is the best, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Give me another shot at beating you tomorrow, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Oooooh, that one felt really close! You nearly had me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
But victory is mine today![VAR 0114(0074)]
But I’m pretty tuckered out for today.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Let’s save the revenge match for tomorrow! I’ll be waiting for it![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m pretty tuckered out for today. Come ask me for another battle tomorrow, ’K?[VAR 0114(0074)]
You know, [VAR 0100(0000)], we have so much to thank you for...[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s all because of the Watts you shared with us that we were able to make the Master Dojo into the fine facility it is today.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I tried my best to help
No, no... It was nothing!
And you succeeded! It’s amazing how you managed to collect so many Watts![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, you humble H[VAR 1100(00FF,0405)]ubertolly! I won’t have you downplaying this effort![VAR 0114(0074)]
You know, when my hubby first told me that he wanted to open a dojo of his own...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I have to admit, I had a lot of doubts.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I was still working at my previous job at the time.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And there was simply so much work that went into getting the dojo built...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Let alone the question of whether anyone would even want to move to an uninhabited island like this, just to train at an unknown dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
But...my hubby-wubby and I both gave it our all.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And when Hyde came along, the students all pitched in and helped out with everything.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And of course, you’ve been a huge help as well, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
We’ve made it to where we are today because we got so much help from so many people...[VAR 0114(0074)]
This has been an entirely different chapter of my life, but it’s turned out to be a great one![VAR 0114(0074)]
So thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’d like you to take this. Not as any sort of payback for all you’ve done, but just because I want you to have it.[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s a very rare card that only the master and I have had copies of until now![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, look! Slowpoke![VAR 0114(0074)]
Slooow...
Po?
Teehee! Don’t they look all lovey-dovey to you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Ahhh! This has been so lovely! It’s been so long since I was last able to simply take a nice stroll without worrying about a thing![VAR 0114(0074)]
Just feeling the lovely breeze on my face...[VAR 0114(0074)]
But if we stay away too long, I suppose everyone will start to worry about us.[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s time we headed back home![VAR 0114(0074)]
Let’s go home!
Can’t we stay just a little longer?
Heehee! Of course! Our family is waiting![VAR 0114(0074)]
Now, now... Look who is trying to hog Ms. Honey’s attentions all to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imerself![VAR 0114(0074)]
Thank you for the lovely stroll, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0074)]
Though, I’m a little embarrassed about how much I blathered on about my own past![VAR 0114(0074)]
Don’t tell anyone I’m such a soggy Sally! I’m counting on you![VAR 0114(0074)]
If you could spare us another [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, [VAR 0100(0000)], then...let’s see...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I could hire a hair stylist for the dojo so you could change your look whenever you like! How would that sound?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I could try to get the dojo one of those Rotomi terminals, like they’ve got at Pokémon Centers![VAR 0114(0074)]
I could get our Rotomi actually up and running![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll put in a vending machine where you can buy really cheap drinks whenever you like![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll increase the vending machine’s lineup by adding Soda Pop, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll increase the vending machine’s lineup by adding Lemonade, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll have fresh ingredients for cooking delivered regularly to the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make it so you can buy nutritious supplements from a vending machine right here at the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make more kinds of supplements available in our vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make even more kinds of supplements available in our vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll have a special Master Dojo design made for your League Card![VAR 0114(0074)]
[~ 239]
I’ll be able to make you a true work of beauty! You’ll have to wait to find out just what! Teehee![VAR 0114(0074)]
[~ 241]
I’ll set you up with the chance to battle a frightfully strong Trainer! Really![VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, there’s not much more that I can offer you...except maybe a bit of my time? We don’t get much time to really talk here at the dojo with so many students around. Would you like to go on a nice quiet walk, just you and me?[VAR 0114(0074)]
[~ 244]

Oh, you! You know, I’ve got nothing left to give you! You’re just doing it for your own satisfaction at this point, huh?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I can’t repay you in any way, but how many Watts do you want to share with us?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Thank you, love! I’m sure the dojo will put it to good use in some way or another![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hrmm... If only someone— *mumble* No, but who would gather that many— *mumble*[VAR 0114(0074)]
What’s this? There’s a note stuck to the refrigerator... “These ingredients are for everyone’s meals! No nicking food outside of mealtime! —Honey”
The refrigerator is packed full of ingredients. What are you in the mood for?
[VAR 0109(0001)]

So? Does my Exp. Charm seem to be working as intended?[VAR 0114(0075)]
What is this thing? Some sort of machine made out of junk parts to look like...a Pokémon?
You like it?[VAR 0114(0075)]
Hmph. You wouldn’t get it anyway.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Heh. I thought you might be the type.[VAR 0114(0075)]
That’s my [VAR FF00(0006)]Cram-o-matic[VAR FF00(0000)], and—just to be clear— it’s the invention of the century.[VAR 0114(0075)]
It’s my very own brilliant take on recycling.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Though it doesn’t do a thing right now, since it’s out of power...[VAR 0114(0075)]
If I just had enough [VAR FF00(0006)]Watts[VAR FF00(0000)]... But Mummy won’t give me any more of hers...[VAR 0114(0075)]
All it would take is a measly 500 W to get the Cram-o-matic up and running, y’know?[VAR 0114(0075)]
I can give you that
That’s too bad
Whoa! Seriously?! You’ll give me the 500 W I need?![VAR 0114(0075)]
Do you want to keep going with the same combination of items?
You obtained [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]!
You’re lacking one or more items. Ending combination process...
It’d take me ages outdoors to collect 500 W... And the outdoors and me... Well...let’s just say, our systems aren’t compatible.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But you... Sorry, what was your name again? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]? I guess you’re more the outdoors type, huh?[VAR 0114(0075)]
I’ll feed those Watts you gave me into the Cram-o-matic at once, and...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Power! On![VAR 0114(0075)]
Crrr...
Crrraaa-AAAMMMMMM!
Huhuhu... Perfect. Just perfect.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Put in four items you don’t need, and you’ll get one new item in exchange.[VAR 0114(0075)]
If you put in four of the Apricorns that grow here on the Isle of Armor, then you might even get a rare Poké Ball...if you’re real lucky.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Since you gave me the Watts and all, feel free to use my Cram-o-matic as much as you like.[VAR 0114(0075)]
So if you want [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]...[VAR 0114(0075)]
First you’ll want to add [VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR 010A(0002)]...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Then you’ll need [VAR 1302(0003,0000)][VAR 010A(0003)]...[VAR 0114(0075)]
[VAR 1302(0004,0000)][VAR 010A(0004)]...and ... ... ...[VAR 0114(0075)]
[VAR 1302(0005,0000)][VAR 010A(0005)].[VAR 0114(0075)]
[~ 66]
[~ 67]
[~ 68]
Fine, I’ll explain how the Cram-o-matic works one more time...[VAR 0114(0075)]
You take four items you don’t need, you put ’em in, and then you get one new item. That’s it.[VAR 0114(0075)]
[~ 71]
Huhuhu... Perfect. Now it’s sure to work.[VAR 0114(0075)]
All that’s left is to fire it up with the ON button, so...here we go! Let’s push it![VAR 0114(0075)]
Crrrrrr...
... ... ...
Cripes! It powered down.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Must still need more Watts...[VAR 0114(0075)]
What’s that, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Did you actually manage to get a rare ball?![VAR 0114(0075)]
You’ve got some serious luck. I’ve run the numbers, and those things are rare.[VAR 0114(0075)]
One of Daddy’s friends came here once to make those kinds of balls for him. This real old guy...[VAR 0114(0075)]
He may have been old, but he was good. He could make a rare ball with just one Apricorn.[VAR 0114(0075)]
I tried to observe how he did it and program that into my Cram-o-matic.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But my success rate is still way lower than that old guy could pull off...[VAR 0114(0075)]
But I’ll keep improving my tech, until someday, we can replicate the skills of even a master craftsman through the power of science. Just you wait.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Er. I mean. Forget it... I said too much...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Want me to share one of my recipes with you? I can. It’ll cost you [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] W. That’s all.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Come back when you’ve collected some Watts.[VAR 0114(0075)]
You don’t have enough Watts.[VAR 0114(0075)]

Oi, oi! We don’t get too many Trainers out in these parts!
They call me Digging Pa. You’ve met the Digging Duo? Well, they’d be my sons!
Digging Pa’s the name, and digging’s my game. Well...more my vocation, really.
Haven’t got any Armorite Ore, have you? You know, it’s that rare type of rock the Isle of Armor’s known for?
If you just give us a few pieces of that ore, I’ll put these fine old muscles straight to work, digging you up loads of Watts!
[~ 5]
Shall I dig you up some Watts in exchange for [VAR 0201(0003)] piece[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s of Armorite Ore? You’ll need to jot down a quick record of your progress first, if that’s all right.
Well, give us a shout if you need Watts!
Digging Pa...at your service! What can I do for you today?
Dig me up some Watts
Tell me what my record is
Nothing, thanks
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
Right then. Here goes!
I’ve dug up [VAR 0207(0000,002C)] W just now. Shall I keep on digging?
Phew! That’s all the digging I’ve got in me!
H-hold on! I can...I can still keep digging!
Graaah!
Heh! Feels like I could dig up a Watt trove like I haven’t seen in ages!
Here goes!
There’s [VAR 0207(0000,002C)] W!
One last go, then!
Digging [VAR 0107(0001)]!
Phew. Right. Feels like I’ve settled down a bit.
I dug up [VAR 0208(0001,002C)] W altogether this time.
Your record is [VAR 0208(0001,002C)] W in one session.
Oho! Got yourself some Armorite Ore, have you? Mind giving us [VAR 0201(0003)] piece[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s?
If you get your hands on some Armorite Ore, come give us a piece!
I’ve dug up [VAR 0208(0001,002C)] W!
Hold your Horsea! Bit short on Armorite Ore, aren’t you? Come again when you’ve got a good [VAR 0201(0003)] piece[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s!
Y’know what? Our meeting feels like a real stroke of luck! If you like, I’ll dig you up some Watts for free to mark the occasion! You’ll just need to jot down your progress first. That all right?

Hello. People call me Digging Ma. Have you met Digging Pa? He’s my partner.
I enjoy digging and the thrill of digging with my lovely shovel. It’s my digging friend.
I feel like giving you a piece of Armorite Ore to commemorate our meeting...
But, no! I’ll give you a chance to choose! You could receive the piece of Armorite Ore... or you could use it as payment to have me dig to see if I can find even more Armorite Ore!
However! If my lovely shovel breaks while I’m digging, you won’t get anything...
I do need to ask you to quickly save your progress first, but if you are seeking some thrills, why not try your luck with me?
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
Digging always comes with risks... It’s unavoidable. Brace yourself...
[~ 9]
I’m looking forward to when you’re ready for a game of your lifetime!
Here I go!
Aah... Sorry! I hit a hard rock, and my lovely shovel broke.
The Armorite Ore you were supposed to get is gone...
Such is life! Anyway, see you again somewhere!
I dug up [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Armorite Ore.
[~ 16]
If I stop now, you’ll get [VAR 0203(0002,002C)] piece[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s of Armorite Ore!
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
[~ 20]
[~ 21]
[~ 22]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
Shall I keep digging?
Hehehe! Quitting also takes courage. It might be a very wise decision!
[~ 27]
Hmm? Wait... Wait!
My lovely shovel is whispering that it still wants to dig!
Second wind! Here I go!
Yaaah!
[~ 32]
I’ll give you the Armorite Ore as I promised, then.
I’m Digging Ma— Oh, we meet again.

... ... ...
Di... Di...
Di... Digleeet!
Oh! Diglett! You’re here!
Hahaha! You little rascal! I was worried about you!
Dig!
Thank you for finding my Diglett.
Is that a Diglett?
Is it from Alola?
This is a Diglett from the Alola region!
It’s a regional form. That means it has a different appearance, because it’s from a different region!
Oh! I didn’t expect to meet someone who knows about it!
That’s right! This is a Diglett from the Alola region.
When I traveled in Alola, I fell in love with these adorable three hairs.
I caught a lot of Diglett there and came back. But they went somewhere when I looked away for a second...
Digleee!
Anyway, you found a Diglett buried in the ground...
You definitely have a talent for finding Diglett!
If it’s OK, will you find all the other Diglett, too?
Oh, what a kind person you are! Words can’t express how grateful I am!
Don’t worry. It’s not that hard. During your adventure, all you have to do is find tufts of three hairs and speak to them.
You’ve found [VAR 0202(0001)] Diglett so far, so please find [VAR 0202(0002)] more Diglett.
If you find them, please tell them to come back to me.
If you find the last one, please tell it to come back to me.
Oh! Hello!
Thanks to you, [VAR 0202(0001)] more Diglett came back to me!
One of them has evolved into Dugtrio...
If you find those three hairs again, please tell them to come back to me!
I’m so happy that a lot of Diglett came back. So...
I’d like to give this Pokémon to you!
I met this Pokémon in Alola—just like my Diglett!
I’d like to give this item to you!
Ah... Including the one that just came back, the number of Diglett that have come back is...
Wha—? All 151 Diglett came back?!
Thank you so much! Thanks to you, all my Diglett have come back!
Dispec!
I think this Diglett is saying that you’re worthy of its respect, because you found them all.
Dugether!
What? You want to go together with this Trainer, because you respect h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?
Diii!
Hmmm. I feel a bit sad, but...
if that’s what it wants, I’ll respect its wish!
Please take good care of Diglett.
Diglett became your Pokémon!
How is your Diglett? My Diglett and I are having a blast ’cause I still have 150 of them.

You seem to have an awesome bike! Let me customize it if you’d like!
Oh... Hmmm. Let me know when you get a bike that can run on the water.
I’m a bike lady! I love bikes and bike maintenance!
Do you want me to customize your bike with a design that I came up with?
Sparkling White
Glistening Black
Original design
Yes, customize my bike
I want to change my outfit
Nothing
No, thanks
Which design would you like to choose?
Sparkling White it is! I’ll polish your bike so that it’ll shine with sparkling white light!
Glistening Black it is! Your bike will shine with a special coating!
You want to change it back to the original design? Sure thing!
Hahaha! I get it. You like your bike the way it is!
Come back anytime when you want me to customize your bike.
OK! Hold on a second!
Customization complete! Enjoy your ride!
Your Rotom Bike is now Sparkling White!
Your Rotom Bike is now Glistening Black!
Your Rotom Bike was changed back to the original design.
Come back anytime when you want to try a different customization!
Changing the appearance can change your mood, too! Do you want me to customize your bike?
While I was at it, I also set your bike’s charge speed to the max.
You want to change the color of your outfit. Is that right? Then I’ll make it so that the color matches your [VAR 0101(0006)] there.
Rotom colors
[VAR 0103(0004)]-type color
[VAR 0103(0005)]-type color
Never mind
How about the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color? It would match your [VAR 0101(0006)] very well!
Which color do you think would match your [VAR 0101(0006)] best?
Would you like to use one of these colors to match your [VAR 0101(0006)]?
Would you like to use one of these colors to match your [VAR 0101(0006)]?
Is the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color what you want?
Actually, never mind
Yes! Very good! You’ve picked a wonderful color!
Hmmm. That’s the same color it is now! It’s not a color change at all!

Hi-yah! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Do you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Yes
Tell me how it works
No thanks
No, I’ll quit
Select the type you want to use for sparring.
I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want to do. Some other time, then.
Restricted Sparring is a training course that restricts the type of Pokémon you can use. Select a type first, and then battle using up to three Pokémon of that type. No duplicate Pokémon or items are allowed. If you can win five times in a row, you’ll complete the training. However, if you lose even once, the sparring will end there! You can restore your Pokémon between battles, but only twice in total, so use the opportunities very wisely. That’s all! Do you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Oh, you changed your mind? Some other time, then.
Let the battles begin! Battle No. 1! Ready...
Next. Battle No. [VAR 0203(0001,0000)]! Ready...
[~ 15]
Go!
Well done!
Do you want to restore your Pokémon? (You can restore them [VAR 0200(0001)] more time[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s.)
You lost...but train yourself and your Pokémon, and try again! I’m looking forward to your next challenge.
Your result for this Restricted Sparring set is... You had [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] victor[VAR 1101(0001,0301)]yies with the [VAR 0103(0002)]-type Pokémon restriction!
The way you handle [VAR 0103(0002)]-type Pokémon is flawless!
To recognize your untiring efforts, I’ll give this to you.
I hope you’ll try to complete the training with other types, too!
What?! You completed Restricted Sparring with all types?!
I can’t believe it... Your achievement is just phenomenal!
This accomplishment is sure to go down in dojo history! To commemorate this monumental achievement, I’ll grant you the right to wear this outfit!
I hope you’ll keep exceeding your own limits!
Do you want to continue sparring?
Yes, I’ll have my Pokémon restored and continue
Yes, I’ll continue
Do you want to continue sparring? (You can restore your Pokémon [VAR 0200(0001)] more time[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s.)
You earned [VAR 0201(0003)] BP!
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Have a look at this!
Klara’s performance in that last trial resonated with me...
Avery’s performance in that last trial resonated with me...
so much so that it inspired me to design this original Klara shirt!
so much so that it inspired me to design this original Avery shirt!
But when I offered it to her, she gave me a look like I was trying to hand her some rubbish.
But when I offered it to him, he gave me a look like I was trying to hand him some rubbish.
So being rivals, I suppose you’d be the next best person to give it to, [VAR 0100(0000)]...
But what in the world was wrong with it? I thought it was so well-made!
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

That’s it, Slowpoke! Use that epic poison move![VAR 0114(0071)]
Go, Slowpoke! Use an elegant move![VAR 0114(0072)]
Slooow...
Aw, come on! Can’t you at least try to be more energetic?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Unbelievable... Truly UNBELIEVABLE! All that effort and I’m still just spinning my wheels...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Next time I battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, I’ll be the one that comes out on top.[VAR 0114(0071)]
I need to get stronger so that a certain someone will recognize me for the great Trainer I am.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?! How long have you been eavesdropping?![VAR 0114(0071)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?! How long have you—! Can you use Agility or something?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Are you training?
How’ve you been?
Buzz off! I-it’s none of your business what I’m up to![VAR 0114(0071)]
Tch! Training while in hiding is not very elegant. I turn back what you say as though I used Mirror Coat![VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ve been fine, thank you! And I’m glad to see you look like you’re doin’ fine, too! Now, stop botherin’ me![VAR 0114(0071)]
What an abrupt question... I am doing at least two billion times as well as you are.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Juuust forget ever seeing me here, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Forget what you saw me doing with the utmost of haste! Use Amnesia![VAR 0114(0072)]
You can keep that—if you promise to keep your mouth shut![VAR 0114(0071)]
You are to think of that as a contract between the two of us, understand?[VAR 0114(0072)]
And well... Good luck to you, too, I guess.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Well then, it’s time for— You guessed it... Avery, Teleport![VAR 0114(0072)]
Slooo...?

When you touch clear, clean sand... it can help cleanse your memories of the toil you’ve been through.
If you want to clear away all of a Pokémon’s base points and start with a clean slate, I can help. Give me [VAR 0201(0000)] piece[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s of Armorite Ore, and I’ll cast the spell of sand on a Pokémon you choose.
You don’t have enough pieces of Armorite Ore... You can get them by doing Max Raid Battles on the Isle of Armor. Maybe gather them that way?
Which Pokémon do you want me to give a clear, clean slate?
So you want me to give [VAR 0102(0000)] a clean slate?
In that case, let me cast the spell of sand...
Clean...clean...clear, clean sand... Help me make a clear, clean slate!
All the base points of [VAR 0102(0000)] have been cleared away!
Everything’s clear... Clear and clean... Come back anytime. Lady Clear will always be waiting for you.
If you ever feel like you need a clean slate, I’ll be waiting for you.
That Pokémon’s already a blank slate. I don’t need to cast my magic.

Hmph. You wouldn’t get it anyway.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Heh. I thought you might be the type.[VAR 0114(0075)]
That’s Porygon, a Virtual Pokémon, in the flesh— Er...in the code.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Just imagine, a being brought to life using the pinnacle of scientific capabilities,[VAR 0114(0075)]
making it basically the ultimate crystallization of technological progress![VAR 0114(0075)]
It was designed ages ago now, which explains all its straight lines and angles.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But that’s just what gives it that retro feeling enthusiasts can’t get enough of.[VAR 0114(0075)]
And you can have it evolve into Porygon2 if you trade it with someone while[VAR 0114(0075)]
Porygon’s holding an Upgrade. Its smooth, rounded design is top-notch, too![VAR 0114(0075)]
You get it? This Pokémon captures the entirety of human advancement and progress![VAR 0114(0075)]
Er...so...anyway, you can have it. Hardly anyone ever beats Daddy at his full strength, after all.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Cherish that Porygon. It’ll give you a better appreciation for human ingenuity if you do.[VAR 0114(0075)]

If you weave together Galarica Twigs, you can make a bracelet.
If you give me [VAR 0200(0001)] Galarica Twigs, I’ll weave a Galarica Cuff for you. Do you want one?
Really? It’s super cute, though.
You don’t have enough Galarica Twigs. Why don’t you walk around the Isle of Armor and get more twigs?
Okie dokie. Leave it to me.
Weaving, weaving... Weaving, weaving...
Here it is! Freshly made, just for you!
It’d look very nice on Slowpoke. If you want more cuffs, please bring more Galarica Twigs.
Oh! You have Slowpoke on your team! You like Slowpoke, don’t you? In that case, you might like this shirt, too!
Oh! You have Slowpoke on your team! Slowpoke in other regions are zoned out and adorable, too, aren’t they?
Oh, it’s Slowbro! You gave the Galarica Cuff to your Slowpoke! In that case, you can have this shirt, too!
Oh, it’s Slowbro! I heard that Slowpoke in other regions can evolve into Slowbro without a Galarica Cuff.
The design of the zoned-out Pokémon is perfect for loungewear.
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

Hee hee, you must be super busy! That’s funny, ’cause you really look like you’ve got nothing better to do...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmm. How unfortunate that you would refuse... I shall remember this insult for the rest of my life.[VAR 0114(0072)]
That’s what I’m talking about! C’mon, let’s go to the Battle Court![VAR 0114(0071)]
A wise decision. Let us head for the Battle Court.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Whew, as strong as ever! But I think I’m beginning to get it... Hey, thanks for helping me out.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Just as my Future Sight predicted! But I was still able to learn from that battle. Thank you...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Oooh, I didn’t expect to win! Maybe I am getting stronger! Still, it could be I just got lucky... Let’s do this again, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
An admittedly unexpected victory! Perhaps I released some of my Stored Power? Still, I must become even stronger! I hope you will battle me again sometime.[VAR 0114(0072)]

I am a world-renowned designer of fashion!
You are Galarian, I presume? This is my first time setting foot in this region, and I must say...it seems rather deserted!
Erm, this is...
You’re on the Isle of Armor!
I beg your pardon? I’ve disembarked at the wrong station?!
How fortunate you were here to steer me true! My most heartfelt gratitude to you!
I say, I’ve heard Galar’s Champion, Leon, is quite the beloved figure in the region.
I smelled the opportunity to take advantage of Leon’s wild popularity to seek further riches... Hence, my voyage!
But now I find myself without the funds to even reach my destination!
If you’ve a mind to purchase this delectably, surpassingly cute ensemble I’ve designed for [VAR 0204(0001,002C)], it would cover my taxi fare onward.
I’ll take it!
I’ll pass
Is this island to be my new home then?!
A Helping Hand in my hour of need! What a kindly soul!
My sincerest thanks, my friend! And as promised, here you are!
You got a [VAR 01C2(0001)] ensemble containing [VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR 1302(0003,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0003)][VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR 1302(0004,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0004)][VAR FF00(0000)], and [VAR 1302(0005,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0005)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
Some of these are hard to come by! You’ll be pleased with your purchase—I guarantee it!
And with that, I bid you farewell!
Alas, you simply haven’t the funds!

Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Are you drinking in the Isle of Armor’s natural beauty, too?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I like to get out here now and again. It’s a nice spot for taking it easy, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Isn’t all this unspoiled nature on the island lovely? Look how cheery it’s got little Tsareena![VAR 0114(000E)]
All this lush foliage makes for such a pleasant forest stroll. I should’ve packed a picnic![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wooloo’s got such a fluffy, thick fleece, it could take a tumble from heights like these and still be right as rain![VAR 0114(000E)]
OI! Oi...oi...o...i... Don’t caves like this make you want to shout just to hear the echo?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Look at this great blue sea! If Nessa were here, I bet she’d be over the moon! Not that she’d let it show...[VAR 0114(000E)]
This is far from the friendliest environment for Grass-type Pokémon, but some plants actually thrive in deserts like this![VAR 0114(000E)]
Harsh sunlight actually livens up some Grass-type Pokémon! But on the other hand, it means they’re in for an even worse time than usual if they go up against Fire types...[VAR 0114(000E)]
The weather here on the isle is so fickle! It sort of reminds me of battling Raihan, actually. Makes me a tad nervous...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Ahhh, nothing like a spot of rain! Time for all the isle’s lovely greenery to have a drink.[VAR 0114(000E)]
My hat’s meant for farm work, but it comes in quite handy during weather like this. It’s a lifesaver in battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, it’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! If you keep running about in this thick fog, you’ll slam right into me and go flying![VAR 0114(000E)]
Shalalan.
Well, hello there, Champion! Have you come to see me?[VAR 0114(000F)]
No, no, just winding you up a bit. I’ve got some time off from my modeling and Gym Leader work, so I’m honing my moves.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Look at this—nature as far as the eye can see. Just the sort of spot Milo’d love, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
When it rains here in the forest, the sound’s so calming. It makes for a nice mental refresh if I’ve lost a battle or something.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Doesn’t the breeze up here feel nice? It’s the type of day that makes you think a Wingull might swoop by and bring you a letter![VAR 0114(000F)]
You can get to the sea through here. There are some small islands around there— my favorite spots![VAR 0114(000F)]
The water looks so inviting... Wonder how many seconds it’d take me to swim to that island out there?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Drednaw and I are doing some intensive training. We’re working on moves that can drench even this bone-dry desert![VAR 0114(000F)]
Look at this brilliant swimming weather! Good thing the Hulbury Gym uniform doubles as a swimsuit, so I can dive right in![VAR 0114(000F)]
Clouds have got to cover a certain proportion of the sky for a day to officially be called cloudy. The sky’s at least nine-tenths covered today, so that definitely qualifies![VAR 0114(000F)]
Rain’s got its share of haters, but I guarantee you none of them are Water-type Pokémon! It just goes to show how people and Pokémon don’t always agree on what’s nice weather![VAR 0114(000F)]
Since Drednaw’s also a Rock type, it grows more resistant to special moves during sandstorms.[VAR 0114(000F)]
In thick fogs like this, it’s easy for ships to lose their way at sea. That’s why we have lighthouses, like the one in Hulbury![VAR 0114(000F)]
Munch munch munch.
Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! Your passion for training must burn red-hot if it’s led you all the way to the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ve got to keep on running so I don’t get left in your dust![VAR 0114(0010)]
Centiskorch’s burning body’s been known to start fires in grassy fields! When that happens, I douse it with water from a bottle I bring along![VAR 0114(0010)]
In forests, one tends to meet a lot of Grass and Bug types! Having a Fire type like Centiskorch along is a big help![VAR 0114(0010)]
What better for long training runs than a nice, long staircase? I’ve gone and gotten a tad carried away and done 100 laps, so I’m enjoying a nice break![VAR 0114(0010)]
This place is teeming with Water types—just like Galar Mine No. 2! What a great spot for training![VAR 0114(0010)]
Training in the water is very tough for my team! So I just do enough swimming for Centiskorch and me both![VAR 0114(0010)]
I met my Torkoal in the Potbottom Desert! Since its Ability changes the weather, I suggested to Raihan that he think about catching one. Turns out he took me up on it, so now we’re Tor-colleagues![VAR 0114(0010)]
This type of calm weather is ideal for training! Hup, two, three, four![VAR 0114(0010)]
Clouds may hide the sun, but they don’t keep all its ultraviolet rays from getting through! That’s why I like to wear a hat or some sun cream and stay well hydrated![VAR 0114(0010)]
Rain puts a damper on the power of my blazing moves. Best to send those rain clouds packing with Sunny Day or Max Flare![VAR 0114(0010)]
If you can’t overcome a sandstorm, you’re in for a tough time against Raihan! This is fine weather for concocting a strategy to counter him![VAR 0114(0010)]
You can meet different Pokémon depending on the weather! I wonder what species I’d run into in this fog?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Skorrrch.
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Here for some secret training?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Becoming Champion hasn’t stopped you putting in the effort, I see. I’ll have to stay just as motivated with Machamp and the rest of my team.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There’s a man who was a legendary Fighting-type Gym Leader in his day living on this island. But I’m too intimidated to actually try to go and meet the legend in the flesh...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You never quite know when an Emolga might swoop down... It’s difficult to plan your counter for such an unpredictable Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This area reminds me of Stow-on-Side... Thinking all of the members of the Fighting Gym back home spurs me to train all the harder![VAR 0114(0011)]
Going barefoot makes it more effective when you need to dig in your heels and stand firm. I suspect that’s why Machamp always goes barefoot as well![VAR 0114(0011)]
I find swimming can be very effective when I want to build strength. That means Nessa must be getting quite a lot of training in every day![VAR 0114(0011)]
Doesn’t the layout of this area remind you of a pitch surrounded by spectators’ seats? It’s helpful for visualizing a real battle scenario.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It feels to me like training in harsher weather is more effective than on mild days like this. On the other hand, at least my bare feet get less muddy when it’s nice and clear.[VAR 0114(0011)]
When my thoughts get as murky and gloomy as the sky is right now, sparring with Machamp clears the clouds straight from my mind.[VAR 0114(0011)]
No matter how hard the rain pummels you, you’ve got to keep swinging those fists! You must believe that every punch drives you one step closer to victory![VAR 0114(0011)]
This sandstorm is nothing to me. It’s about as scary as the attack Splash! Not that I’m trying to pick a fight with Nessa...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Even if you can’t see your opponent, you can still sense their presence with your mind’s eye. Being stuck in a bank of thick fog is perfect training for this skill.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ha! Yah!
...O-oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What are you...doing here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Oh, training? Mm... Yeah, you can focus here. ...Since there are no people.[VAR 0114(0012)]
...I-I sometimes see a massive Pokémon across the water. ...Maybe it’s D-Dynamaxing?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...This place feels nothing like Glimwood Tangle. Th-though it’s about as easy to get lost in...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Th-this area’s so steep and rugged, it reminds me of Stow-on-Side. ...T-take care not to fall. We don’t know each other that well yet...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Eep! ...Er, [VAR 0100(0000)]? B-behind you... Ah, er, nothing... It’s nothing too bad...relatively speaking.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I...I can hear so many voices from the sea... Do you think they’re all lonely?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...I’m b-building a little mountain of sand. Apparently if one absorbs enough grudges, it can become a Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Quite a h-hot one today, isn’t it? It’s getting all sweaty underneath my mask. That really...dampens my spirits...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...It’s so dark, with the sky wrapped up in all these thick black clouds. Honestly, it’s a bit of a relief...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Er...would you...ahh? Would you...like to hear a scary story that’s got to do with rain?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Wh-when I’m wearing my mask, even sandstorms aren’t much of a bother. Maybe I should have Gengar and the rest wear masks, too...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I-I’ve made a big discovery! When I can’t see my opponent through the fog, I hardly get nervous at all![VAR 0114(0012)]
Geh heh heh.
What are you doing here? Did that old gran make you come stand guard here, too? March you all the way to the Isle of Armor so you could reach new heights of pink...or whatever?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, never mind, that’s nothing to do with you. Must be just a coincidence.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I know there’s a dojo near here, but I’ll pass. I can’t imagine anything more stressful than living and training in that sort of big group.[VAR 0114(000C)]
My Hatterene was given to me by the chairman. We’ve been through thick and thin together— she’s a very important Pokémon to me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This area looks just like that town with the mural. Gosh, what was I playing at when I went and destroyed that thing...[VAR 0114(000C)]
You and I seem to run into each other in caves a lot, don’t we? It must be fate. Not the good kind, mind.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What a carefree, tedious island this is! It makes me wonder if there’s anything at all to be gained from coming here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hatterene seems right at home in places where there aren’t many living things about. They spare her the stress of sensing loads of emotions all around her.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m itching to show you the new stronger me I’ve become from training out here on this island![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ugh, this humidity’s got my hair all frizzy. Even a Gym Leader like me is trying to look his best— I hope that, as Champion, you take extra care to be presentable![VAR 0114(000C)]
Out for a nice carefree stroll in this bad weather? You’re certainly an odd one...aren’t you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ugh! I’ve got sand in my hair! If I don’t wash it out carefully, it’ll be stuck in there for days![VAR 0114(000C)]
This fog always eludes you, no matter how long you chase after it... It reminds me of you... How disagreeable.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmmm?
Fancy meeting you here, Champion![VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re trying out some tricky movements geared to bring out Coalossal’s full power. So don’t get too comfortable being Champion![VAR 0114(0014)]
An acquaintance of mine gave me an Armor Pass. I figured it’d be nice to have a change of scenery once in a while for our training.[VAR 0114(0014)]
The air’s so damp in here! Makes it quite hot and humid, doesn’t it? If my mum were here, she’d never stop complaining about it. That’s for sure...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Quite the view up here, isn’t it? Look how far you can see! Too bad you can’t make out Circhester, but that’s to be expected, I guess.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Coalossal seems to perk up a bit when we head into a cave. I suppose it must feel like being back home in Galar Mine.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Coalossal may be weak to Water, but its Ability makes it grow much speedier when it gets wet![VAR 0114(0014)]
Watch out—there’s a chance Coalossal might tip over! It’s about three times my weight, so be careful![VAR 0114(0014)]
Daytime here on the Isle of Armor’s hot enough to get me all sweaty. Not like Circhester, where I’m grateful for every bit of heat Coalossal gives off.[VAR 0114(0014)]
What a thick blanket of clouds! Seems like we’re in for some showers. And no, it’s not smoke from Coalossal.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I slipped in the mud and nearly fell... But I managed to turn that into a backward somersault and land safely![VAR 0114(0014)]
Being able to walk around in sandstorms like this unbothered is one of the greatest things about wearing sunglasses![VAR 0114(0014)]
No matter how many times I wipe my lenses, they just fog back up and I can’t see a thing... Training’s on hold until this fog clears![VAR 0114(0014)]
Chugga chug.
Goodness, fancy meeting you here! Curious about my top-secret training regime, are you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, that’s a shame, because I can’t let you see! You’ll have to wait just a tad longer.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I got an Armor Pass from someone I know, so I thought...why not take the chance to raise my Pokémon in some fresh scenery?[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s so damp in here and the heat’s unbearable! Perhaps my Circhester outfit was a touch too heavy after all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Quite the view up here, isn’t it? Look how far you can see! A shame you can’t make out Circhester, but I suppose that’s only reasonable.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Just now I slipped and fell on my rear, but I wasn’t a bit hurt. Thank goodness I layered up properly![VAR 0114(0015)]
Ahaha! The moment we get near the water, Lapras looks ready for a swim. Perhaps it’s time for a break from training.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Whoever named this place was spot on—it’s like standing in the bottom of a curry pot! A fine place to train oneself to face the harshest of environments with a stiff upper lip![VAR 0114(0015)]
It gets so hot in the Isle of Armor sunlight— it makes me break out in sweat! I just want to spend the daytime clinging to my nice, cool Lapras.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s quite gloomy with all these clouds, isn’t it? Take care you don’t trip over a rock or a Slowpoke lying around.[VAR 0114(0015)]
What a cool, refreshing rain! Lapras is loving the chance to soak in it, too![VAR 0114(0015)]
Goodness me, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Isn’t this sand something? Thanks to my hat and muffler, though, it’s nothing too awful.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I suspect you might find some unusual Pokémon in mist-erious weather like this![VAR 0114(0015)]
Lanla lalala.
Gah! When I run into you, it’s usually a sign things are about to get sticky...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve got my own business to take care of, so I won’t be hangin’ around with you this time.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Seems like a lot of different Pokémon make this place their habitat—just like the Wild Area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m no Leon, but I’m really gettin’ turned around in this forest. Might just call a Flying Taxi, if it comes to that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
That red tower’s dead cool lookin’, innit? But it’s givin’ off a real Fightin’-type vibe, so I’m keepin’ my distance...[VAR 0114(0016)]
It’s so dim and cool in here... Feels perfect! Sounds get pretty muffled, though. Not the greatest concert acoustics.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Look at this—a deep blue ocean of pain... I’m sure if Marnie were here, she’d be whinin’ about wantin’ to have a swim. Me, though, I don’t like swimmin’ much. I hate gettin’ sunburnt.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Alone we stand, Obstagoon and me, with these silent sands for company... Heh. Think this place just gave me the idea for my next song.[VAR 0114(0016)]
It’s just too sunny out today. I’m not havin’ it. I don’t mind the humidity, but the heat’s all the way up to eleven.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’d think the moves of Dark types would get wicked strong on gloomy, gray days like this, yeah? But you’d be wrong.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Look at you. All full of beans, even in this soakin’ wet rain. Hope Marnie brought an umbrella if she’s out and about...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Seein’ a sandstorm takes me back to battlin’ Raihan in the Finals.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We could take cover in the fog, then lash out suddenly with Sucker Punch... I’m thinkin’ up ways we could win without needin’ to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Shou ou out!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?! What’re you doin’ here?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Actually, don’t bother answerin’—I can tell. You’re here for the same reason as me, ain’t ya? That’s why yer my rival.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If I let Morpeko loose in this thick grass, I’ll lose sight of it right away. Gotta keep a close eye...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Y’know those Pokémon up there flitting from tree to tree... Emolga? Kinda look like Morpeko, don’t they?[VAR 0114(000D)]
What’s that red building s’posed to be for? It looks cool in those Spikemuth Gym colors...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Dark, cramped places like this kinda calm me down a bit. It’s like bein’ back home in Spikemuth.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Look at that gorgeous ocean! Wouldn’t it be great to all go have a swim? On the other hand, Grimmsnarl’d probably take yonks to dry out after...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m trainin’ to walk steady even on tricky ground like this! Why not give it a try?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Ain’t this a nice breeze, [VAR 0100(0000)]? This is just the type of weather that’d make my bro stay shut up inside.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Pretty dark, ain’t it? Looks like we might have rain comin’. This is just the type of weather that’d get my brother amped up.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Even on rainy days like this, you gotta give it all you’ve got! Toxicroak’s all right thanks to Dry Skin, but as for you, watch out you don’t catch cold![VAR 0114(000D)]
Man, this sand stings! Wonder if a Pokémon’s pair of Safety Goggles’d work for me...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Whoa! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?! Don’t scare me like that! I can’t see a thing in this fog. Thought you were a ghost or somethin’...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara. ♪
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Drawn in by my charisma, were you? Since you’re here, let’s jump right into a battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
If only... Fact is I’m in the middle of some top-secret training now. I’m gonna beat you and Leon both. I hope you’re ready for it![VAR 0114(0017)]
When it comes to putting dragon Pokémon to good use, I’m not picky about their types. There’re Pokémon perfect for the job all over the place. Probably even in the tall grass over there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ahh, the forest here on the Isle of Armor is so hot and steamy... It’s perfect! Makes me wish I could somehow capture this humidity to use in battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
Look at this place... Talk about a selfie spot! I wonder which is higher, this mountain or the roof of Hammerlocke Stadium?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Cave ceilings can get awfully low sometimes, eh? Better not let any of my fans catch a shot of me banging my head on one...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Picture this: a Pokémon battle on the beach, with the big beautiful ocean in the background... and me winning, of course. I can hear the likes rolling in already![VAR 0114(0017)]
I don’t know if it’s conducting heat from the sand or what, but Duraludon’s as scalding hot as a pot of curry on the flame right now. Watch your hands, or you’ll get burned![VAR 0114(0017)]
The sun sure is something here on the Isle of Armor, isn’t it? A person ought to be careful they don’t overheat if they’re walking around out here at midday.[VAR 0114(0017)]
The island gives off a whole different vibe under heavy clouds like these. Reminds me of the time you fended off the Darkest Day![VAR 0114(0017)]
Here comes the rain, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Feel its cold dampness soak into your body... My Sliggoo evolved into Goodra on a day just like this.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Let the winds blow! Stream forward, Sandstorm! Nah, just having you on...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Man it’s gotten foggy out here... I’ll pass on the Misty Terrain, thanks—I’d rather not have my Dragon-type moves get all weak.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Alloy!
Huh? Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Didn’t think I’d run into you out here![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m hard at work surveying the island, really. I’ve only been skiving off the teeniest bit. Hardly at all![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Pokémon live totally different out here than they do back in the Wild Area near home. You can tell even in these little patches of grass![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is one maze of a forest. You can hardly blame that Lilligant for losing track of its Petilil.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m absolutely shattered from that climb... But what a view you get from up here![VAR 0114(0005)]
How’d a strange cave like this come about naturally, I wonder? Maybe the river carved it out?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Isle of Armor’s got such nice beaches! Wish I’d brought my swim gear... F-for surveying, obviously! Aquatic surveying![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sand, [VAR 0100(0000)]! There’s sand everywhere, mate! In my shoes! Between my toes! Like everywhere![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve been walking around for ages, so it’s good to just stop sometimes, you know? Dubwool seems to feel the same![VAR 0114(0005)]
These sure look like rain clouds to me... If they were a bit whiter, they’d look comfy enough to kip on—just like Dubwool’s wool![VAR 0114(0005)]
I bet Pokémon that live by the water just love these kinds of rainy days. Watch your step as you explore, though—the ground’s all muddy and slippery![VAR 0114(0005)]
Owww... I got sand in my eye! I’m getting flashbacks to Hammerlocke Gym...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Isn’t this fog just like in the Slumbering Weald? There could be Legendary Pokémon about![VAR 0114(0005)]
Memeeeh!

Do you like taking your Pokémon for a stroll?
All right! Have a nice long walk together!
All right! Inside the ball it is, then!
You decided to have your lead Pokémon walk around with you on the Isle of Armor!
You decided to keep your Pokémon in its ball as you walk around!

Why, hello there! I’m just someone who makes it so that you can use Pokémon brought over from other regions in Ranked Battles!
But! In order for them to participate in Ranked Battles, they’ll need to forget all their moves and learn new ones that can be used in Ranked Battles instead!
Do you have Pokémon from other regions that you would like to have participate in Ranked Battles?
So then, which Pokémon would you like to have participate in Ranked Battles?
[VAR 1003][VAR 0102(0001)] will need to forget all the moves it knows and learn new ones that it can use in Ranked Battles. Is that OK?
They won’t be able to recall any rare moves that they know right now. Are you sure you’re OK with that?
Oh, it looks like [VAR 0102(0001)] is ready to participate in Ranked Battles already! Isn’t that just grand?
All right! Then let the lesson begin!
Now [VAR 0102(0001)] is all ready for Ranked Battles!
See you again sometime!

This must be your first visit to the Crown Tundra. Am I right?
I’m researching Pokémon biology around here.
A number of ancient and rare Pokémon have been spotted in the Crown Tundra, you see.
If I update your Pokédex for you, will you help me research what species appear here?
Your Pokédex is being updated... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The Crown Tundra Pokédex has been added to your Pokédex!
Do your best to complete your new Crown Tundra Pokédex!
Do you want to show me your Crown Tundra Pokédex?
Do you want to show me your completed Crown Tundra Pokédex again?
Oh, that’s too bad.
OK! Let me see.
Your current progress on the Crown Tundra Pokédex is...
[VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon seen and [VAR 0202(0001)] Pokémon caught!
Haha. No worries. You just got your Crown Tundra Pokédex! Good luck! I’m cheering for you.
Haha. You’re still new to this area, but you’re doing well! The kinds of Pokémon you can encounter will be different from place to place. On snowy paths, in caves, on top of mountains, and everywhere else... If you want to meet many different Pokémon, walk around everywhere!
What? You already caught 30 Pokémon? You’re making good progress. By the way, do you pay attention to the weather? If it’s sunny or rainy or if there’s a hailstorm or even a raging sandstorm... Depending on the weather, you’ll encounter different Pokémon.
Have you already caught 50 Pokémon? So fast! You’ve already caught about a quarter of the Pokémon here. Keep exploring the Crown Tundra, but be careful in the snow.
You’ve been steadily increasing the number of Pokémon in your Pokédex! If you use Quick Balls to quickly catch Pokémon, I bet you’ll have caught more than 100 different Pokémon in no time!
You’ve caught 100 Pokémon so fast! I was right about asking you to help me with my research. You’re about halfway there. Keep up the good work for the latter half, too.
It’s so fun to look at a Pokédex filled with information. It looks like you’ve been to many places—by the water, in caves, and on mountaintops. Keep on doing what you’ve been doing, and finish your Crown Tundra Pokédex!
I’ve never seen a Crown Tundra Pokédex that’s been filled this much! You must be fishing, too! It’s a great way to find Pokémon, but it’s easily overlooked, isn’t it?
You’re getting so close to completing your Crown Tundra Pokédex! You no longer need my advice. I believe you can do it. I’ll be waiting for you!
Congratulations! You finally did it!
You completed your Crown Tundra Pokédex!
Thanks to your hard work, I made remarkable progress on my research.
I’m so glad that I asked you to help me!
To commemorate your great achievement, let me add something special to your League Card!
Done!
Please also take this as a token of my gratitude!
You’ve done something not everyone can do! Congratulations!
Hehehe! I can’t get tired of looking at this awesome Crown Tundra Pokédex! Congratulations!
Oh? That Pokémon...
Is that the Hex Nut Pokémon [VAR 0101(0001)]?!
It’s a Mythical Pokémon you can’t find anywhere in the Galar region.
Thank you for showing me [VAR 0101(0001)]. Please take this as a token of my gratitude!
It’s a hex nut cap to go with your Hex Nut Pokémon. Isn’t that cute?
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

Oi oi, Chief! How goes the adventurin’? Anything to report?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Doesn’t look like you’ve got any fresh progress to report on this one yet![VAR 0114(0076)]
Got anythin’ else legendary you wanna talk about?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! You’ve given me a report on [VAR 0101(0001)] already![VAR 0114(0076)]
The legend of the King of Bountiful Harvests
The legendary giants
The legendary bird Pokémon
Could I get some adventure hints?
Calyrex
Regirock
Regice
Registeel
Regieleki
Regidrago
Articuno
Zapdos
Moltres
Never mind
Oho, changed your mind? It happens! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Look at that! You’ve already reported everything there is to report on that one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Wait—you really caught [VAR 0101(0001)] from the legends?! That’s ultra-mega-brilliant! Report away![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm... So that’s Articuno, is it? The Legendary Pokémon that can manipulate ice?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I definitely see the resemblance, but it’s got this dodgy mask on and everything... and it hardly seems cold at all, does it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh well! It’s got one ultra-mega-icy gaze![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s Articuno enough for me, anyway. Let’s call this expedition a success![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm... So that’s Zapdos, is it? The Legendary Pokémon that can cause thunderstorms?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I definitely see the resemblance, but those legs look thicker than I expected... and it’s not exactly electrifyin’, is it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh well! It’s as spiky and as long-beaked as I hoped for![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s Zapdos enough for me, I s’pose. Let’s mark this expedition complete![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm... So that’s Moltres, is it? The Legendary Pokémon that’s the embodiment of fire?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I definitely see the resemblance, but it’s not at all hot to the touch... Kinda looks like it’d be more at home with the punks in Spikemuth than in a volcano, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh well! Looks a bit like it’s burnin’ if you don’t look too close![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s Moltres enough for me, I s’pose. Let’s call that an expedition well done![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great craggy thing’s Regirock, the rock giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does it bear a strikin’ resemblance to our Grass-type Gym Leader?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Look at those broad, burly shoulders! This fella and Milo are a proper pair of boulders![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it’s rocky and gianty enough, I s’pose! Let’s call this expedition successful![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great frozen-stiff thing’s Regice, the ice giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does it look like it’d make one ultra-mega-dazzlin’ chandelier? Wish I could light it up and show it to darlin’ Nia![VAR 0114(0076)]
That aside, look how massive and mighty it is! Gives me the chills just lookin’ at it, I don’t mind sayin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it’s icy and gianty—I’ll give you that! Let’s consider this expedition complete![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great smooth thing’s Registeel, the steel giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does its top half look a bit like a massive bowling ball?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Look at that blank, inscrutable mug, though... You can’t guess what’s goin’ through its head![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it’s steely and gianty enough, I s’pose! Let’s call this an expedition well done![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great crackly thing’s Regieleki, the electric giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Y’know what it reminds me of? That colorful candy that pops and fizzes and crackles in your mouth![VAR 0114(0076)]
Imagine the balance it must take to stay upright with that constantly shiftin’ body! Gives me the shivers, I don’t mind saying![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it looks electric and gianty enough. Expedition successful, I s’pose![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great jagged thing’s Regidrago, the dragon giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does it look like it’d pack a really strong pinch? It’s a bit like a massive clothespin, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I’d better not go provokin’ it—doubt it’d have a bit of trouble openin’ wide and snappin’ me up![VAR 0114(0076)]
I s’pose I’d say that’s a dragony giant! May as well call this expedition a success![VAR 0114(0076)]
Th-that...that...[VAR 0114(0076)]
that noggin’s MASSIVE![VAR 0114(0076)]
I-is that the King of Bountiful Harvests? The one callin’ the shots around here?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh. I could swear I’ve seen it before... Or then again, maybe not...[VAR 0114(0076)]
A-anyway! It’s definitely regal of it to have a steed...[VAR 0114(0076)]
and that massive head does sort of resemble a crown![VAR 0114(0076)]
It’s kingly enough, at any rate! Let’s just call this a successful expedition![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like you’ve reported all there is to report on Legendary Clue 1 and the King of Bountiful Harvests![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like you’ve reported all there is to report on Legendary Clue 2 and the legendary giants![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like you’ve reported all there is to report on Legendary Clue 3 and the legendary birds![VAR 0114(0076)]
Smashin’! I’ll mark this expedition done![VAR 0114(0076)]
Crack on with solvin’ those legends, Chief! You’ve expeditions to...expedite![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like that’s about all the reportin’ you’ve got to report just now! Go give those other legends a nice, thorough investigatin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which adventure’s got you feelin’ stuck?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, the legend of the King of Bountiful Harvests? This one’s a head-scratcher for sure! Make sure you’ve had a gander at the statue in town and heard everythin’ the townsfolk have got to say, for starters! Never hurts to open up your Town Map and check your Legendary Clue to take a fresh look from square one, either![VAR 0114(0076)]
Right—the legendary giants! Which one’s givin’ you trouble?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The giant of rock
The giant of ice
The giant of steel
The two giants
Well, all these giants are sleepin’ in ruins, so you’ll have to find those ruins before you can do anythin’! Try and track down the buildin’ I drew for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the rock giant’s ruins open, are you? So, it says to [VAR FF00(0006)]let the first Pokémon hold a never-changin’ stone[VAR FF00(0000)], eh...? Well, why not try havin’ your ultra-mega-lead Pokémon hold on to that stone or whatever it is? Haven’t you got anythin’ like that? A stone that just stays the same forever?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the ice giant’s ruins open, are you? So you’ve got to [VAR FF00(0006)]walk together with a livin’ crystal of snow[VAR FF00(0000)], is that it? Well, if it’s a livin’ thing, I reckon it’s got to be a Pokémon, innit? Maybe if you take a snow-crystal-lookin’ Pokémon by for a stroll and show what good mates you are, the door’ll swing on open![VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the steel giant’s ruins open, are you? So it says to [VAR FF00(0006)]let ring out the piercin’ note that will wake the giant of steel[VAR FF00(0000)], does it...? I suppose giant or no, a Pokémon’s a Pokémon! If you make a sound that brings Pokémon runnin’, maybe the door’ll open on up for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the two giants’ ruins open, are you? Let me get this straight... [VAR FF00(0006)]“When gather the three giants, the door of destiny shall be opened”[VAR FF00(0000)]? Er, Chief? Not to be too blunt, but...this one’s just what it says on the tin! Go get to work findin’ those other three giants first. Save this one for later![VAR 0114(0076)]
So you’ve got the door open but haven’t actually had a run-in with the giant yet? It must be pretty dark in there, innit? Maybe the giant’s still havin’ a kip... Why not see if there’s a switch or somethin’ in there that you can hit to brighten things up?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, the legend of the bird Pokémon! For starters, you ought to try headin’ to that massive red tree growin’ waaay down at the southern end of the tundra![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, the legend of the bird Pokémon! Which one’s givin’ you a hard time?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The orange bird Pokémon
The black bird Pokémon
The purple bird Pokémon
Ah, that orange bird Pokémon that’s sprintin’ around the Wild Area! It’s ultra-mega-speedy, accordin’ to the people who’ve seen it! But however quick those legendary legs are, it’s still a Pokémon in the end! That means, sooner or later, it’s bound to get knackered! You’re lookin’ at a contest of endurance, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, that black bird Pokémon that’s flyin’ around the Isle of Armor! Just chasin’ it down won’t get you anywhere if it soars up and out of reach, eh? Better try and get ahead of it to give it a scare! Once it catches sight of you, it might get cheesed off enough to take a swoop at you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, that purple bird Pokémon that’s flyin’ around the Crown Tundra! I’ve heard if you chase it down, it makes copies of itself to throw you off, then does a runner! You’ll just have to keep your hair on and see past the Pokémon’s tricks to get to the real thing! But if I know you, Chief, you’re more than up to the challenge![VAR 0114(0076)]

Would you like to embark upon a Dynamax Adventure?
Yes, please!
How does this work again?
No, thanks
According to my notes, it seems you might know how to find certain special Pokémon. Which Pokémon would you like to set out to find today?
According to my records, you’ve previously caught [VAR 0101(0000)]. Isn’t that right? [VAR FF00(0001)]You won’t be able to catch it again[VAR FF00(0000)], even if you find it once more. Would you still like to embark on this adventure?
My records indicate that last time you went on an adventure, you found [VAR 0101(0000)]. I noted where you found it, so you can try to take on [VAR 0101(0000)] once more. What would you like to look for this time?
[VAR 0101(0000)]
Anything is fine
To take part in a Dynamax Adventure and explore the Max Lair here, you will need to use one of our rental Pokémon.
You and three other Trainers will work together as a group, coming to a consensus to decide which path to take. Make your way in as far as you can, in the hopes of reaching the Legendary Pokémon that lurk in the furthest depths, Dynamaxed and waiting!
[~ 12]
If you go on a Dynamax Adventure, I will provide you with Dynite Ore as a reward. I’ll also allow you to keep one—just one—of the Pokémon you catch along the way.
Oh, you quit your last Dynamax Adventure without finishing it, didn’t you? It’s not really fair to your teammates to hang them out to dry like that. Try to stick it out next time!
It seems that you keep quitting your Dynamax Adventures midway through... That sort of thing is hard on your teammates. Before I let you join another team, I’m going to ask that you give me [VAR 0201(0000)] piece[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s of Dynite Ore to show that you’re serious. Can you do that?
Until you can prove your dedication, you can’t take part in any more Dynamax Adventures.
You don’t have enough Dynite Ore.
You can collect Dynite Ore by taking part in Max Raid Battles in the Crown Tundra.
Try to make sure that you see your future Dynamax Adventures through to the end.
Well done defeating that tough opponent! I hope we’ll see you again soon.
Well done facing such a tough opponent! Victory seemed so close—I could almost taste it!
Would you like me to jot down where you found [VAR 0101(0000)] this time so that you might challenge it again?
Oh dear, it looks as though I’ve run out of space for any more notes here... Are there any older records you wouldn’t mind me erasing?
In that case, I simply won’t mark down where you found [VAR 0101(0000)] this time.
Very well. Then I’ll scrub out [VAR 0101(0001)] here and jot down [VAR 0101(0000)] instead.
There we go! All nice and properly noted for the future!
I look forward to working with you again soon!
Oh, that’s a bit of a letdown, isn’t it? I hope you’ll come and give it another go soon!
Welcome back. Would you like us to keep a record of where you found [VAR 0101(0000)] this time?
Roger that! I’ll write it down for you.
Then I won’t bother keeping my notes about where you found [VAR 0101(0000)].
Hm? Oh. You, huh? I appreciate the hello, but you’re not ready yet for what I’ve got to offer. Try me again when you’ve got some more of these Dynamax Adventures under your belt.
So...how about it? You like Dynamax Adventures?
Course you do, clever la[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]dss! You’ve taken on loads of ’em, after all!
Hmph... Have it your way, then...
For someone as skilled at Dynamax Adventures as you are, I’ve thought up a little something special: an Endless Dynamax Adventure. What do you say? You interested?
You want to give an Endless Dynamax Adventure a go, friend?
What’s my record?
An Endless Dynamax Adventure is just what it sounds like: endless! Even after you defeat one of the special Pokémon that lie within, you can keep going onward to see how far you can push yourself!
All the Pokémon you catch in this mode’ll be going toward my research, I’m afraid, so I won’t be letting you keep any after the fact. But in return, I’ll load you up with even more Dynite Ore than you usually get.
And of course we’ll keep records of how far you make it, so try to push yourself to your limits, together with your mates!
Let me know whenever you’re up for a challenge.
Now THAT is what I call a fine performance! You set a new record! I keep track, you know.
I’ll keep a record of how far you made it this time, so let me know if you want to try to best it sometime.
Here it is. Your best record so far is...
Keep it up if you hope to do even better.
[~ 47]
Oh, hey! It’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Listen—I’ve found [VAR 0101(0001)] down in the Max Lair![VAR 0114(0078)]
If you like, I’ll tell you where [VAR 0101(0001)] is in exchange for [VAR 0202(0002)] piece[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s of Dynite Ore![VAR 0114(0078)]
Wait a sec—you’ve got loads of Pokémon locations written down already! Better clear one out, hadn’t you?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Wait a sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]— you’ve already caught [VAR 0101(0001)]! I can show you where to find [VAR 0101(0001)] for [VAR 0202(0002)] piece[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s of Dynite Ore if you like— you just won’t be able to catch it! Sound OK?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Peonia told you where to find [VAR 0101(0001)]!
Hang on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Bit short on Dynite Ore, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Hmm... Well, gosh, I feel like taking pity on you this time! Just this once, I’ll give you the scoop for free![VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh, wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]... You already know where [VAR 0101(0001)] is![VAR 0114(0078)]
Are you absolutely certain? Don’t come crying to me if you regret it later![VAR 0114(0078)]
You can kick things off by talking to that scientist lady. Go get ’em![VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You all right? Me, I’m carrying on like usual, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0078)]
By the way, I picked up this odd thing in the Max Lair. You can have it.[VAR 0114(0078)]
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
Don’t worry—go ahead and take it! It’s not really my cup of tea anyway![VAR 0114(0078)]
Why d’you think so many Legendary Pokémon hang around in the Max Lair anyway?[VAR 0114(0078)]
According to that scientist lady, the first Legendary Pokémon sighted down here was [VAR 0101(0000)].[VAR 0114(0078)]
That scientist lady apparently used to work at a lab in the Alola region! Doesn’t Alola sound absolutely brilliant? Just think... All the malasadas you could eat![VAR 0114(0078)]
I really want to use an Ability Patch on my dear Tyrantrum. That’d give it a much easier time using Head Smash. It sure loves that move![VAR 0114(0078)]
The trick to having a good Dynamax Adventure? Well, using moves like Reflect or Light Screen to stave off some damage is a big help.[VAR 0114(0078)]
The trick to having a good Dynamax Adventure? Well, I guess you ought to keep a close eye on how the Pokémon inside handle different types![VAR 0114(0078)]
The trick to having a good Dynamax Adventure? Well, you can really turn up the excitement by usin’ a move like Max Knuckle to raise ally Pokémon’s Attack stats![VAR 0114(0078)]
Hey, have you heard the rumors about this great big tree, the Dyna Tree? Apparently, something nice happens if you give it a good shake! I don’t think I’ve got the arms for it, but I bet you could shake it up good, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0078)]
You know how Pokémon down in the Max Lair are always Dynamaxing? Think there’s some massive Wishing Star deep underground or something?[VAR 0114(0078)]
How’re your legend-hunting expeditions with my old man going? You don’t need to take ’em too seriously. He’s not the most responsible guy, after all.[VAR 0114(0078)]
That bloke over there’s a bit funny, isn’t he? Probably not as funny as my old man, to be fair...[VAR 0114(0078)]
Hey, have you heard the rumors about this long-haired woman? Apparently, night after night, she visits a grave in the tundra, always looking for something...[VAR 0114(0078)]
So I was once on this Dynamax Adventure, and my teammate’s Oranguru had the move Instruct. That move let it give the other Pokémon orders. It was a massive help!
Sablish!
We have Pokémon helping us out with our investigations, too, you know.
Dott dott.
Dot dot dot.
Ditt dott.
Perhaps it’s measuring something? The readings seem to be fluctuating.
It’s probably not a good idea to head in here alone... Let’s turn back for now.
You decide to head back to the entrance, keeping an eye out on the way. Maybe you’ll spot Peony’s daughter somewhere!

There’s this pointy-feathered one in the Wild Area![VAR 0114(0076)]
Plus a fiery-lookin’ one out on the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0076)]
And this fancy, graceful one’s apparently flyin’ about the Crown Tundra![VAR 0114(0076)]

You caught [VAR 0101(0001)], one of the legendary bird Pokémon from the clue!
Better report back to Chief Peony!

Where, oh where, could you be, my...?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Oleana?!
A ghost?!
Oh my. Champion? I didn’t expect to find you here.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I beg your pardon? There is no ghost here— only a now-mildly-peeved Oleana.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But what a stroke of luck. You may just have the information I need.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Word has reached me that Chairman Rose has supposedly been seen in these parts.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I know full well that cannot be true, but I could not help but come and investigate.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Would you happen to know anything about Mr. Rose somehow being here in this tundra?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think I might...
Sorry, I don’t
You do?! What do you know? Tell me straightaway![VAR 0114(0007)]
No, I suppose you would not. Things are never as simple as that...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hey hey, Chief! What brings you here in the dead of night?[VAR 0114(0076)]
M-Mr. Rose?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Come off it! Me? Rose?! Talk about a mix-up![VAR 0114(0076)]
You... You’re not Mr. Rose at all![VAR 0114(0007)]
But there is a slight resemblance. Could you be Mr. Rose’s...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Looking closely, I can see you do indeed lack his intelligence and grace... Not that a particularly close look is needed.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oi, Chief. Do you know this joker?[VAR 0114(0076)]
*gasp* Does this mean the “Mr. Rose” seen here was...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
...[VAR 0114(0076)]
I am now one extremely peeved Oleana![VAR 0114(0007)]
You may be Mr. Rose’s brother, but ultimately, you and he are nothing alike![VAR 0114(0007)]
Well, now that I know Mr. Rose is not here, I see no reason to linger.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Farewell, Champion. And likewise to...that man over there.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hello? Have I reached the Flying Taxi service? I need a pickup from the Crown Tundra, please.[VAR 0114(0007)]

Yes! There they are![VAR 0114(000B)]
These are exactly what I was looking for! I knew my hypothesis was spot on![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm? Wait... [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing in a place like this?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Exploring!
What are YOU doing here?
Are you having me on? This freezing place? Hardly the kind of locale I’d pick to go exploring, if it were up to me...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I keep asking myself that exact same question! If I’d known it was going to be this cold here, I would’ve thought things through a bit more...[VAR 0114(000B)]
But here I am, stuck in the Crown Tundra, trying to learn more about a group of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
There are some Pokémon that prefer places where there are no people, you see—Pokémon that choose to live in isolation.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Crown Tundra here is just the place for that sort of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If my theory is correct...[VAR 0114(000B)]
then I think a certain trio of Legendary Pokémon could be lurking somewhere in these lands![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m sure my theory’s not wrong. If you want some proof, then look there! See those [VAR FF00(0006)]footprints[VAR FF00(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
My theory is that the legendary Iron Will Pokémon, Cavern Pokémon, and Grassland Pokémon are all somewhere out here in the Crown Tundra![VAR 0114(000B)]
And there’s [VAR FF00(0006)]evidence[VAR FF00(0000)] like this scattered all over the place that’ll lead us to them![VAR 0114(000B)]
If we could find more evidence and collect 100 percent of the data needed to track these Legendary Pokémon, then I bet we could use my Pokémon Finder to figure out what habitats they’re living in![VAR 0114(000B)]
But this place is wicked cold, and it’s putting me in hibernation mode...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Are you planning to stick around here for a while, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Think you could try to spot more evidence like this and report it to me when you find it? I’ll reward you for your hard work, of course![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll be waiting in that house there, so I can stay warm and cozy and maybe feel my fingers...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, so that I can grip a pen and write, of course! Since I’ll be working so hard on my research![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! How’s it going gathering evidence?[VAR 0114(000B)]
About that evidence...
Where can I find the Pokémon?
Have you located any Pokémon?
It’s going
Want to check your progress, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Let me see what you’ve found so far...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Look at this! You’ve already found all the evidence we need! Now it’s time to get out there and prove the legends true by finding all the Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
Data for the [VAR 0104(0001)] is at [VAR 0202(0002)] percent...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 30]
Keep plugging away at it![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ve gathered 100 percent of the data needed to track the [VAR 0104(0001)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
This should be enough data for us to pin down where it usually lives![VAR 0114(000B)]
This should be enough data for us to pin down where these Legendary Pokémon live![VAR 0114(000B)]
So if I feed all this data into my trusty Pokémon Finder...[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s searching for energy signatures... ... ... ...[VAR 0114(000B)]
And it’s found a matching Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
And it’s found matching Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
The [VAR 0104(0001)] can be found [VAR 0105(0002)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ll finally get to come face-to-face with the Legendary Pokémon we’ve been searching for. Best of luck, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]

We still don’t have enough data, though, to pin down just where the Pokémon can be found. It’d be great if you could carry on poking around the Crown Tundra to try to find more clues![VAR 0114(000B)]
Keep that chin up, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! I know you’ve got this![VAR 0114(000B)]
That Pokémon... Isn’t that the [VAR 0104(0001)], [VAR 0101(0002)]?![VAR 0114(000B)]
I... was... RIGHT! I knew it! I knew my theory was right![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Er, sorry. Please don’t mind me. I just got a bit too excited there. Here! You definitely deserve a reward for showing me such a fine Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
Now I’m certain that the other two must be here in the Crown Tundra, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
Keep up the search, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
No way! That... Isn’t that the [VAR 0104(0001)], [VAR 0101(0002)]?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bang up job, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I knew you could do it![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah, sugar, there I go again... But it’s so hard to contain my excitement! Here! Take this for giving me the chance to see this Legendary Pokémon in the flesh![VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s just one more Legendary Pokémon we haven’t tracked down yet... So, hop to it! You’ve got this![VAR 0114(000B)]
That Pokémon! I knew it! That’s the [VAR 0104(0001)], [VAR 0101(0002)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
We did it! This is just amazing! Who’s the greatest professor in Galar now?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ack! Er... Don’t tell my gran I said that, would you? But I couldn’t be happier about what we’ve done here! I hope you’ll take this little reward![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s all thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)], that I was able to prove my theory was correct! Thank you so much![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’d make a first-rate assistant for my work if you weren’t already the Champion![VAR 0114(000B)]
You know, there’s an old legend about Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion...[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s said that to protect their allies, they waged battle against humans bent on destruction.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And ever since then, they’ve kept themselves apart from humanity.[VAR 0114(000B)]

I am a world-renowned designer of fashion!
Ah, it’s you! I am in your debt for your assistance back on the Isle of Armor.
I remember you!
Wait—who are you?
Your prodigious memory is matched only by your generosity! Indubitably!
Don’t pretend you’ve gone “one, two, and ta-da” and forgotten! You bought the ensemble I designed!
I received quite a shock after we went our separate ways, what?
I’d gone to all the trouble of designing Leon- themed clothes to capitalize on his fame...
only to find he was no longer Champion! Bah!
Thanks to this blasted new Champion, my clothes haven’t sold one jot! So as a token of my gratitude for your help, I will bestow some of my unsold stock upon you!
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] ensemble containing [VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR 1302(0003,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0003)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
I have not abandoned my dreams of achieving true grandiosity!
My next number will become truly grand! And I shall be a wealthy gentleman indeed!
Have you anything that could provide some grandiose inspiration? A giant of local legend, for example!
J-just a moment! That Pokémon you have there...
Is that one of the legendary giants of the Crown Tundra?!
Hmmm. I say, that is jolly good, but I’d rather like to see something a touch more...modern! Have another go! Chin up, what!
It’s Regidrago! Smashing! Not only is it a giant of legend, but it looks like it packs a ferocious roar... How altogether novel!
It’s Regieleki! Smashing! Not only is it a giant of legend, but it looks like it packs a tremendous jolt... How altogether novel!
My cup runneth over with inspiration!
Aha! Yes! Yes, that’s just the ticket!
Behold! A legendary garment infused with the grand and the modern alike!
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
I do say, if you come across another giant, kindly show it to me!
A work of staggering genius, indeed! I frighten even myself sometimes.
How could I ever thank you enough?
I say, the inspiration you’ve provided shall propel me to ever-grander heights of grandiosity!

I believe it might have something to do with the current situation we’re in.
I really need to buckle down and focus on my research of the Max Lair!
But Poipole keeps trying to wander off as soon as I take my eyes off it.
I’d like a skilled Trainer to accept Poipole and take care of it for me. You wouldn’t happen to be interested, would you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
I am convinced that the only one who could handle Poipole is you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. What do you say?

Hardy Crops for the Tundra
Try the Freezington Snow Samba!
Town Records: Tourism Initiatives
I’m done reading
The king was a great Pokémon that brought abundance to our cold land. With a sweep of its right hand, the land would be blanketed in verdant grasses and blooms. With a sweep of its left hand, the fruit of the fields would ripen and grow heavy. Its great crown of green gleaming, the king galloped across the land astride its proud steed. And in their footsteps, buds would burst from the soil, and rich life was born across the region. And so we worshiped the Pokémon and paid it all due tribute as king.
The horse Pokémon gave over its power to serve the king and carry it hither and thither. The two even became one for a time, combining their strength to create a forest in a single night. This proud steed had been a wild thing once, ravaging the village crops and causing much woe. But the king, in all its greatness, brought this fierce creature to heel and secured its loyalty. And for each among us who claims the steed’s hide was black as the midnight gloom in which [VAR FF00(0006)]ghosts[VAR FF00(0000)] appear, there is another who claims it was white as a block of solid [VAR FF00(0006)]ice[VAR FF00(0000)]. None alive can now say which is the truth.
Through these reins did the king send its power, in order to tame and control its proud steed. The reins, in fact, were made by the hands of the people, in thanks for the plenty brought by the king. These reins bound not only the horse and the king to one another—they bound the people to the king as well. At the dawning of each new year, we must never forget to gift the king with this offering. Let the radiant flower and the mane of the steed be woven together to bind us all in faith. Let the secrets of this sacred art be passed from parent to child to grandchild and never forgotten.
While carrots can be grown in the Crown Tundra, they have rather unusual growth habits. When grown beneath the heaped snow, these hardy roots tend to develop into Iceroot Carrots. When grown in tracts close to where many souls are laid to rest, Shaderoot Carrots will be your crop. Shaderoot Carrots are a favorite treat for many [VAR FF00(0006)]Ghost-type[VAR FF00(0000)] Pokémon, while [VAR FF00(0006)]Ice-type[VAR FF00(0000)] Pokémon seem to delight in eating Iceroot Carrots. According to old fairy tales, the steed that the King of Bountiful Harvests rode upon loved both of these varieties—or perhaps one or the other. Records seem to contradict one another, with some stories speaking of a white steed delighting in Iceroot Carrots and others mentioning a black steed devouring Shaderoot Carrots.
Isn’t it tough dealing with the cold here on the tundra, with temperatures seeming to drop lower and lower with every passing year? While it’s tempting to stay indoors where it’s cozy, don’t forget to move that body, too! Try the Freezington Snow Samba today, and get your body moving to stay warm all winter! “Lift both hands in the air, wave here, wave there, bow low, touch your toe, and freeze! Then up we pop to start it all once more!” ♪ Form a circle with friends, and don’t be shy! The Snow Samba will keep you young at heart!
Freezington Souvenir Brainstorming Sessions (Minutes taken by the town’s tourism lead) We got a lot of submissions in our last round, so our thanks to all who contributed ideas. We’ve settled on an idea for a new Freezington souvenir sure to lure in more visitors: a shirt featuring our own King of Bountiful Harvests! By reusing the artwork from some old documents, we should be able to keep design costs low, too.

Too true that Charizard is blazingly strong. But other Pokémon can be strong as well! That’s why I want the strongest of challengers to fill the Gym Challenge and come battle me![VAR 0114(0004)]
My wish is for Galar’s Trainers to work together to become the strongest in all the world![VAR 0114(0004)]
Graaawrrr!
Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
So, my number-one fan in all the world has come out of his way to pick me up![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look at you, Hop! I reckon you’ve grown...exactly an inch and a quarter since the last time I saw you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Bingo! That’s the sort of sharp eye that’s kept you undefeated so long, eh, Lee?[VAR 0114(0005)]
And these bright eyes over here... I’ve got it! You must be [VAR 0100(0000)]—am I right? I’ve heard loads about you from my little brother.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m the Galar region’s greatest-ever Pokémon Champion—and a massive Charizard fan, too. People call me the unbeatable Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, Lee! And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Bet I can beat the both of you back home![VAR 0114(0005)]
That Hop... Always wanting to be the best, isn’t he? With a proper rival of his own, I bet he’d push himself to become something truly special...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, everyone! I bid you farewell for today! But don’t you fret... I’ll always be around to make sure everyone in Galar can have a champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

Take a good look, you two![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, Lee! You promised us a present! So out with it! You brought [VAR 0100(0000)] and me Pokémon. You did, didn’t you? I know you must have![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right then! The greatest gift from the greatest Champion... It’s show time, everyone![VAR 0114(0004)]
The Grass-type Pokémon... Grookey![VAR 0114(0004)]
The Fire-type Pokémon... Scorbunny![VAR 0114(0004)]
And the Water-type Pokémon... Sobble![VAR 0114(0004)]

Sobble
Grookey

Go on—you pick first. I’ve already got my Wooloo, after all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Where are you going, [VAR 0100(0000)]?! You haven’t chosen a Pokémon yet![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! My dream is to help make the Trainers of the Galar region strong as they can be. Choose a partner for yourself and become one of those strong Trainers, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Scorbunny is Fire type. It’s filled to bursting with fiery passion![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s the Water-type Sobble. It adapts to anything, as surely as water flows.[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, eh? It’s soothing—like a nice, long walk in the woods.[VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 6]

You’re set on the Fire-type Pokémon Scorbunny?
Going with the Water-type Pokémon Sobble?
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, is it?
It’s natural to want to consider your options! Though going with your instincts is fine, as well! You choose your dear partner however you like![VAR 0114(0004)]
You chose [VAR 0101(0001)]!

I’m aiming to be the next Champion, so be ready! You and I’ll be doing some serious training![VAR 0114(0005)]
I bet you will be, Hop. That’s why I brought along these Pokémon for you and [VAR 0100(0000)]. So the two of you can battle and train and grow stronger together...to try to reach me![VAR 0114(0004)]
And you’ll come with me! Charizard will show you the ropes. He’s strict—but real strong and real kind, too![VAR 0114(0004)]

The next day...
You spent the whole night with that new partner of yours, right, Hop? You two getting on all right? Understanding one another? Maybe even built up a bit of love?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Course I have, Lee! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s made fast friends with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR 0101(0001)], too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then listen up, new Trainers! Believe in yourself and your Pokémon! If you trust in one another and carry on battling side by side long enough, then someday...[VAR 0114(0004)]
you might even become worthy rivals for me, the unbeatable Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
What’re you looking at h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer for, Lee?! I’m the one who’ll be coming to challenge you![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you think [VAR 0100(0000)] might be able to challenge you, then I guess [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s my first rival! But I’m not planning to lose to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer and miss out on my chance to beat the unbeatable Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0110
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just having a Pokémon with you doesn’t make you a real Trainer, you know. Proper Trainers raise their Pokémon up to be first-rate in battle, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and you think you’re worthy of calling yourself such a proper Trainer already, Hop? Guess I’ll be the judge of that! Let’s see how you handle yourself in a battle against your friend, if [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s up for it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What do you say? Willing and ready to take Hop on in the first-ever Pokémon battle of your life?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Then how about I give you a spot of advice. You don’t want to go getting so caught up in things that you forget everything you’ve accomplished till now. Take a moment to jot down what you’ve done, in order to save a record of your progress![VAR 0114(0004)]
Believe in your partner Pokémon! And care for them, too, with all your heart. Do those two things, and I’m certain you’ll learn to choose the moves that suit your Pokémon. And more importantly...to have a champion time battling with them![VAR 0114(0004)]
Looks like everyone’s on board, Pokémon and Trainers alike? Then let’s do this![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve watched every match that Lee’s ever had! I’ve read every book and magazine he left behind at home, too! I know exactly what to do in order to win![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that was a shock! Guess I know now why Lee thought he should give you a Pokémon, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry, mate. Even if you did get your Pokémon direct from a champ like Lee, looks like I’m still the greatest![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and your Pokémon all fought hard. Made me almost want to let out Charizard and join in on all the fun! Good effort out there, [VAR 0101(0001)]! Why don’t I get you all sorted?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)], you’ve got real promise! In fact, I’ve got a favor to ask you... Be a real rival to Hop, would you? Push him, and make the both of you stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
Me and [VAR 0101(0002)] are ready to have a go at you anytime![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0120
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I already want to get stronger and stronger! You’ve seen me battle now, Lee, so come on— you’ve gotta let me take on the [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokémon Gyms[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You? Join the [VAR FF00(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR FF00(0000)]? You think you’re ready for the single greatest competition in the Galar region? Not putting the cart before the Rapidash there, Little Brother?[VAR 0114(0004)]
If that’s really what you want to do, you two have a whole lot you need to learn about Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Especially your friend [VAR 0100(0000)]. Before you think about getting Gym Badges, best to think about getting a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
A Trainer’s Pokédex helps them learn lots of things about all the Pokémon out there, including their strengths. But it’s more than just a collection of data, you know. It’s a record of a Trainer’s love and passion for Pokémon training![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, right, we get it... Pokédexes, then! We’re on it! Looks like it’s off to the Pokémon Research Lab for you and me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the kind of enthusiasm a Trainer needs! I’ll let the professor know to expect you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m going to be the next Champion, so completing a simple Pokédex will be nothing! Just another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’d probably better go tell your mum that we’re heading out, though.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve found yourself a perfectly lovely partner, haven’t you? Congratulations, dear.

*CRASH*
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you hear that just now?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The gate’s open! And the Wooloo that was there...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It was tackling the fence pretty hard earlier. You don’t think it actually broke through there, do you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s off-limits! Nobody’s supposed to go in there! I remember the professor’s granddaughter went in once, and she came back in a real state... And that was nothing compared to the earful she got from the professor afterward![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... What do you say?[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got to save it!
I don’t know...
Right? Even if we’re not supposed to, this is the kind of scene where you simply have to do what’s needed![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right... No one wants to get in trouble, least of all me. But deep down you want to save that Pokémon, too, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hope you’re ready for anything, because we’re going in, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Doing all right there, [VAR 0101(0001)]? Let’s be sure you’re in tip-top shape.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There. Now let’s push on![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Not trying to ditch me in here, are you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Did you hear that? Was that a Pokémon crying out, you think?![VAR 0114(0005)]

Wha—? Lee? How’d you manage to find your way here? You’re pants with directions. You always get lost.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, that’s nice to hear from the little brother who had me worried sick! I’d been waiting ages for you two, and you never showed! Of course I came looking for the both of you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, where’s the Wooloo?! We were trying to rescue that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Meh!
The little chap’s just fine. Though all of you had fainted by the time I found you here. You know this place is out of bounds... But it took courage to come in here all the same. And I can understand well enough why you did it. You did good, Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
And at least that Wooloo’s all right... Yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I thought we’d had it when that weird fog started rolling in and that mad Pokémon attacked... but at least it wasn’t all for nothing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Attacked by some mad Pokémon? What are you talking about, Hop?[VAR 0114(0004)]
It seemed loads stronger than any Pokémon I’ve ever seen. And it just had this sort of presence... Our moves didn’t even touch it. I mean, really— they seemed to pass right through it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your moves passed right through it? So, the fearsome Pokémon they say live in the Slumbering Weald... Are they actually illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Get strong enough and maybe the two of you could be the ones to reveal the truth someday.[VAR 0114(0004)]
For now, let’s simply get out of this place. You’ll be all right now that I’m here with you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even if we did get an earful from Lee...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Guess I’ll probably train up [VAR 0101(0001)] a bit by having it battle against Pokémon in the tall grass.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You should get yourself to the building with the purple roof and the great red and white ball mark out on front. That’s the Pokémon Research Lab![VAR 0114(0005)]

What is it today, Leon? Looking for info on another never-before-seen, superstrong Pokémon? I wish you’d stop with these outlandish requests.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Good to see you, too, Yamper![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yamper here is a real champ when it comes to helping you find your way around. He came to my rescue plenty of times back in the day, when I got lost on the road. Oh yeah, and that’s his Trainer, Sonia. What can I say about Sonia? Well, I like the way she cooks. She makes food you can gobble down in a flash.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Tsk. What kind of an introduction is that? Did you forget we were rivals during our Gym Challenge? It wasn’t just Yamper helping you out. I did, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, nice to meet you! Name’s Sonia. I’m the professor’s assistant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is [VAR 0100(0000)]. [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s a new Pokémon Trainer. Set h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer on the right path, would you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
*sigh* What does he think I am? He’s always got his head in the clouds. It’s no wonder he gets lost all the time.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh. Looks like you’ve got a Rotom Phone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey there, Rotom![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bzzzrt!
Rotom Phones are handy little things, aren’t they? They’ve got a map and a navigation tool. That said, Leon still gets lost, so...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, sorry. So tell me, do you know a lot about Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You bet!
Not really...
Well said! In that case, I’ll make it so that you can use the [VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
Don’t worry! Here, I’ll make it so that you can use the [VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
You obtained the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Just so you know, that Pokédex is a gift from my gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
Could you let Gran know that you received the Pokédex? She lives in the house down along Route 2.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Leon’s a right amazing Champion, and I’m basically just an assistant... I’m not even Gran’s official assistant, either. I’ve just been calling myself one... Somehow, it makes me feel a little restless.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 22]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0215
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hey there, Trainer! Sorry to stop you.
You just left the Pokémon Lab, right? So that means you’ve got a Pokédex, yeah? I love talking to new Trainers and giving them useful stuff.
It’s a Potion. Use it when your Pokémon’s HP— their hit points—gets low. HP is like a Pokémon’s stamina. You can even use Potions during battle.
Knowledge is power! It’s a good idea to talk to lots of different people and read everything you can on your journey!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0220
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Got your Pokédex from Sonia? Then it’s time to meet lots of different Pokémon and start building up a strong team![VAR 0114(0005)]
But battling strong Pokémon in the wild can leave your team in a bad way. Not to mention what battling another Trainer can do... Luckily, we’ve got Pokémon Centers![VAR 0114(0005)]
Luckier yet, they’re dead easy to spot. They look the same wherever you go.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Bet you’ve never been inside one![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0230
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Level with me, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Is this your first time in a Pokémon Center?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...
Of course not
Then I don’t think you need me to tell you what you already know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then the future Champion’s got you covered![VAR 0114(0005)]
First things first—you talk to the lady at the counter if you want your Pokémon healed up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And Pokémon you catch are kept in computers like the one you can find here, see? After all, you can only bring six Pokémon with you on the road in your party.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Potions they sell at the Poké Mart got me out of a real rough spot the other day!
If you two kids are Pokémon Trainers, you might want to buy some Potions before you head out!
Cheers! I’m already good, though. I’m heading to Route 2, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Come find me, maybe, when you’re done here![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0240
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’ve been thinking... If you’re a Pokémon Trainer now, you must want to try your hand at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR FF00(0000)], right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge?
What’s that?
The Gym Challenge, mate! The annual competition where Trainers can battle it out for the right to challenge the Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
But the trick is that you’ve got to be endorsed if you want to take part. And Lee doesn’t seem to think I’m up to snuff... So I’m thinking I ought to talk to the professor and see if she could help![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve got to take part, too! A proper rival is just the thing every Trainer needs to keep growing stronger, after all. Keeps you motivated, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The professor’s house is way down at the end of Route 2, so let’s head there...and give our teams the chance to train up a bit along the way![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0250
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Over here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]? It’s time we filled in our teams a bit—[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m here to teach you how! You’ll need to catch Pokémon if you’ve got any hope of filling in that Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee?! Where’d you come from?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Only...look at you, little [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve already caught some on your own! Your mum gave you those Poké Balls, did she?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Every Pokémon has got a type or two, which can make it good against some opponents but poor against others. That’s the reason you’ll want to catch different Pokémon—to cover one another’s weaknesses. Now, let’s all have a champion time as I show you how it’s done![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
[~ 8]
Typical Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll give you some more Poké Balls. In return, I’ll only ask that you catch plenty of Pokémon! The Pokémon around here seem easy to catch. Almost like they’re itching to join some Trainer’s team, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Pokémon on your team will get Exp. Points when you catch Pokémon, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course, they get Exp. Points from battle, so take on the other Trainers you meet along the path to help your Pokémon thrive. Your team will keep on changing and growing as you get stronger together, no doubt... But even I don’t know exactly how yet! Show your Champion something good, all right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right! I’m gonna catch loads of Pokémon. The professor will be shocked when she sees![VAR 0114(0005)]

Look! There’s the professor![VAR 0114(0005)]
So have you unraveled all the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon yet?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh goodness, no. The whole thing is still full of questions. I’d hoped that my granddaughter would take over my research, but...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Dear me, I’m sorry. I didn’t even notice my guests![VAR 0114(0042)]
My name is Magnolia. Welcome, young Trainers! Now come, let’s head indoors.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Why, Hop dear. I see Wooloo has made some new friends.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And you must be [VAR 0100(0000)]. I trust you received the Pokédex from Sonia. I’m sure you’ll have it complete in no time![VAR 0114(000A)]
You must already know about Dynamaxing, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Professor Magnolia’s been doing research into the Dynamax phenomenon for years and years. And it takes a proper understanding of the thing if you plan to use Dynamaxing to the fullest![VAR 0114(0004)]
There you go again, Leon, always talking about Pokémon. There are other things that are worth knowing about, too, you know. Like how many different types of tea there are![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hey, Professor, do us a favor, would you? Help me convince Lee he should endorse us for the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh Leon, why wouldn’t you endorse them?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hop and [VAR 0100(0000)] only just started out as Pokémon Trainers... There’s still loads they don’t know yet![VAR 0114(0004)]
Dearie, I thought your dream was to have everyone in the Galar region become strong Trainers. Isn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, yeah...you’re not wrong. That goal’s precisely the reason I gave them both Pokémon, in fact.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, then. In that case...how about this? Let’s see if the two of you can show me such a brilliant battle that I’m left with no choice but to endorse you. And don’t worry. I’ll make sure both your teams are in good shape before the battle starts.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right! I’ll be waiting outside, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now remember, be sure to give it everything you’ve got. That’s the best thing you can do for your Pokémon—and for yourself, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0280
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I’m going to become the greatest Pokémon Trainer there is! And to do that, I need that endorsement to take part in the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come at me with everything you have so we can prove to Lee that we’ve got what it takes![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
I’m rather interested in seeing how you two young Trainers battle, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Listen, you two. The reason I’m unbeatable is because I learn from every battle I see or take part in. That’s how I’ve gotten to where I am today. So show me something good in this battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll be sure to. Ready for this, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Time for a serious match between you and me... to fill in another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
I need to prepare...
It’s time for my legend to begin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, fine... Guess I can wait a bit.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hurry it up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve gotta battle me so I can get myself that endorsement![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember what I asked you, don’t you? I think you’ve got potential, and that’s why I want you to be a real rival to Hop. And that’s direct from your Champion Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0290
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And I even got my Poké Ball throw perfect, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
This was you getting back at me for last time, wasn’t it? Argh! I’m gutted to lose to you of all people![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hah! See that! I knew I could do it. Am I ever glad I could beat you this time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Undefeated! And my Pokémon’s moves were seriously on point![VAR 0114(0005)]
The sting of defeat and the joy of victory... I guess going through both is the key to the two of us getting stronger, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0300
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop! Well, after seeing a match like that one... I suppose I’ve little choice but to give you both an endorsement as Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yes! Thanks, Lee! I swear I’m going to win my way through the Gym Challenge to reach you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You may both be young still, and plenty rough around the edges, but it was a proper battle. Charizard and I were both feeling the excitement in every last cell in our bodies![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hop, you’ve always tended to get caught up in things like how you throw your Poké Ball out... Things that have nothing to do with real strength. Honestly, I’d been worried about you still obsessing over that sort of nonsense, but it seems you really have grown a bit, Little Brother![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I’d like to see some more thrilling Pokémon battles out of you, too, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You and me are going to train up against one another to aim for that Champion’s title![VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Against one another?
The more we keep battling against one another, the more our Pokémon will grow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the way of it when you’ve got a great rival! Just like you’ve got me, and I’ve got you![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0310
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Huh? What’s that?![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Would you look at this? They’re Wishing Stars! Since there are two of them, you should take one yourself![VAR 0114(0005)]
With one of these, my Pokémon can Dynamax! They’re gonna be massive! YES![VAR 0114(0005)]
Trust you to pull something like this! They say Wishing Stars fall down for those who have a true wish in their heart, you know.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I will be the greatest Trainer ever! I WILL be the greatest Trainer ever! I WILL BE THE GREATEST TRAINER EVER!!! There! I’ve said it three times, so surely my wish will come true now, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t be silly, Hop. Those Wishing Stars are composed of a curious sort of rock containing unknown power... They are one of the most precious resources we have here in the Galar region. But they won’t do a thing for you in that state. Give them to me now, and I’ll have you sorted.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, right. You’ve done heaps of research on the Dynamax phenomenon, haven’t you, Professor? Then please! Give [VAR 0100(0000)] and me the power to Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
First we got to battle against that mad Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald, and now this... It really feels like we’re getting caught up in the adventure of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0005)]
I do understand your excitement, young man, but don’t get carried away. You want to save your energy for tomorrow’s journey![VAR 0114(000A)]
Seems I came back home right in time for all the excitement![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, you lot, why not have some dinner. You must be hungry, right? I’ve been totally obsessed with making the latest trendy curries.[VAR 0114(000B)]

It’s morning at last! And time for our adventure to truly start![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good morning to you, young Challengers.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hop, is it true you really met some Pokémon you didn’t recognize? Is there anything more you can tell me about it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, well, there was weird heavy fog, and then this even weirder Pokémon appeared... [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] tried to fight it off! But then I think we both passed out or something. It’s all pretty hazy.[VAR 0114(0005)]
A right fount of information you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Hop, these are for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You got a Dynamax Band from Professor Magnolia and slipped it on your wrist!
Those are your Dynamax Bands. I made them by fitting the Wishing Stars you found last night into those bands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thanks, Professor! This is brilliant! It’s just like the one Lee has on him, too. Now we can Dynamax our Pokémon like he does![VAR 0114(0005)]
My word, you don’t waste any time, do you? I think you’ll find it’s not so simple as all that. There are a number of conditions you must meet if you hope to have your Pokémon Dynamax and take on that gigantic form.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, don’t be afraid to go to all sorts of places and meet all sorts of Pokémon. That will help fill out your Pokédex, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The legend of my reign is finally about to begin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ll beat you to the station![VAR 0114(0005)]

You will have the chance to meet many Pokémon and Trainers in the Wild Area. You may even encounter Dynamax Pokémon in such places. Put your faith in your partner, and push yourself to new heights together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
A strange Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald... I don’t know... I’ve got an uneasy feeling for some reason...[VAR 0114(000B)]

Text File : main_event_0340

One last thing before we race, [VAR 0100(0000)]. See, I’ve got some great advice for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know how you sometimes see Pokémon wandering about out of the tall grass, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you move real slow like, and crouch down, those Pokémon won’t pay you any notice.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But on the other hand... If you whistle at them, you’ll be SURE to catch their attention![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re a bit rubbish at whistling, just remember this: “Need a fail-proof trick? Press the Left Stick!”[VAR 0114(0005)]
Try it out, and let’s see who can catch the most Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember Wedgehurst Station, right? Where we went to pick up Lee before. That’ll be the goal, so see you there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ll never beat me to the station at that pace![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, out with it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How many did you catch? I caught a really special one![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got... Not one?! What were you doing this whole time? You’re going to want a team if you’re a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got yourself... Ooh, just one! Looks like we’re at a draw. Though we are rivals and all, so that’s fair![VAR 0114(0005)]
But look at how many you caught! You’re well on your way to building a fine team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s a technical machine! A TM, mate! With a TM like that, you can teach your Pokémon a new move in a flash. And you can use them again and again, too. That one can teach the move Swift. Lee gave it to me ages ago, and now it’s yours.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge will begin in Motostoke! And our train’s waiting, so let’s go![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0350

Not quite so fast, you two.[VAR 0114(0009)]
What’re you doing here, Mum?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew this day was coming since the moment you chose [VAR 0101(0001)] as a partner, darling.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Professor Magnolia was kind enough to let us know that you two were setting out. So here—a last little gift to see you well set on your way. All the kit you’ll need for camping![VAR 0114(0008)]
No matter what happens out there, if you and your partner are together, I know you’ll be fine.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks, Mum. And just think how lucky you are— mother to the first ever pair of Champion brothers! Because I’m certain to be the Champion next. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course you will be, darling. Anyway, do have fun and take care of yourselves! You’ll be welcome back home anytime![VAR 0114(0009)]
We’re off!
We’ll be fine!
Wish us luck! Not that we’ll need it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are loads of brilliant Trainers and all kinds of Pokémon out there waiting for us![VAR 0114(0005)]
My excitement’s running ahead of me even faster than that train can go, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Come on! We’re off![VAR 0114(0005)]
I imagine those two will be facing quite the surprise when they arrive in Motostoke.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But who can blame them? A train journey does always set the imagination on fire.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Boo ai!

Hey, Mr. Station Master! Isn’t this the Wild Area? What’re we stopped here for?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes... This is the Wild Area Station, make no mistake. I’m sorry to tell you that the train is halted, due to a flock of Wooloo on the tracks.
What’s there to be sorry about? This is brilliant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Brilliant?
What is?
This Wild Area is massive! There are loads of Pokémon to battle here! You get it, don’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]? This is the best possible place to put together the greatest team![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can get you back to Wedgehurst, if you like. But Motostoke is off the menu for now. It wouldn’t be very decent of us to try to drive off those Pokémon just because we happen to want to run our train here, now would it?

And between there and here are countless new Pokémon waiting to be met![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hello. And if it isn’t Sonia.[VAR 0114(0005)]
My gran gave me a proper earful, in her own way... “Those two young Trainers are setting out on a journey, but what are you doing with your life?”[VAR 0114(000B)]
That sounds rough
Ouch, Professor...
Ah... Never you mind that! Nothing to worry yourselves over! Besides, I’d been quite curious about that Pokémon you two met in the forest. I’d been thinking I should look into it, so the timing works out fine![VAR 0114(000B)]
If I discover something really huge, then maybe even Gran’ll admit I’ve got some talent![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yikes... Being an adult has got its own challenges, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I said you needn’t worry about it! I’m glad to be on the road. Really! It’s been ages. It’ll be great fun to fish and camp and rough it outside again.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Well, I’m off to go stick my head in as many of those red glowing dens as I can find. I’m going to battle the snot out of a bunch of Dynamax Pokémon and fill in another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
What cheek! Dynamax Pokémon are really on another level, you know! You’d better Dynamax your partner Pokémon, too, if you want to take on opponents that strong![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ll find spots here and there in the Wild Area that emit a red beam of light. If you think you’re up to it, check them out. There’ll be Dynamax Pokémon lurking inside! So with that, how about I send you off with a little treat from me?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With a Pokémon Box Link, you’ll be able to put Pokémon from your team into your Boxes or take Pokémon from your Boxes to add them to your team. Nice, right? So go wild catching as many Pokémon as you like, and fill in some more of your Pokédex![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Wild Area is waiting for you! This is the start of your real adventure![VAR 0114(000B)]

Uhhh...
Yup! The Gym Challenge opening ceremony.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What? You seriously forgot about the Gym Challenge opening ceremony?[VAR 0114(000B)]
By the way, the ceremony tomorrow is being held at the Motostoke Stadium, OK?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Use that lift over there to get to the stadium, ’K?[VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! All right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
One look tells me that you’ve become a Trainer worthy of that endorsement I gave you! And...yes, I reckon you might even be ready to use this... Here, try giving this to your partner to hold![VAR 0114(0004)]
You heading for Motostoke Stadium?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I am!
I’ve got other plans first
You can take that lift up to the city’s upper level, if you’re headed for the stadium next.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you might want to have a look around the city first. Only don’t get lost like I do! When you’re ready to visit the stadium, take the lift to get up there![VAR 0114(0004)]

Let’s get signed up![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re here to register for the Gym Challenge, I’ll need to see your endorsement, please.
Fancy that... This is the first time we’ve had a challenger endorsed by the Champion!
Well, now you’ve had two, because I am as well![VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! Two of you at once?! I wonder what’s come over Leon this year... The two of you must be something special.
I’m Hop! I’m Leon’s little brother, in fact. And the next Champion. Get me all signed up, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
W-well, yes, I am trying to... If you’ll just give me a moment...
There! You two have been successfully registered as Gym Challengers. You can now choose your preferred number for your uniform, if you’d be so kind? It will be displayed on the back of the uniform you must wear for any official match.
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], is it? Very well. And here. Please wear this Challenge Band at all times to identify yourself as a Gym Challenger.
The opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge is to be held here tomorrow. All the Trainers taking part have been booked a room at the nearby Budew Drop Inn.
That’s the League Chairman for you! Even booked us all hotel rooms! I’m off to check out the fancy digs![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re lookin’ a bit gobsmacked by all this. You must be from some small country town, is that it? I’m quite the same myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I was endorsed by the chairman himself. In other words, among all those elite enough to get an endorsement, I’m the most elite of all. So why don’t you clear off and not try talking to me again, would you? It’s positively criminal of you, wasting the time of someone as important as I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]

If you’re looking for the Budew Drop Inn, you’ll find it’s not far from the stadium. Head toward Route 3—it’s along the way.

Hiya! Looks like you both got yourselves registered.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh hey, Sonia! What’re you doing at our hotel?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m researching the mysterious Pokémon that are said to be in the Slumbering Weald. I reckon if I look into some of Galar’s legends, I might figure something out. Care to join me? You’re here already anyway.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s this, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s a statue of the hero who once saved the Galar region. I could run through the legend right quick, if you fancy?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The short version, if you please!
Give me all the details!
Long ago...a great black storm covered the Galar region. People called it “the Darkest Day.” The land was assaulted by gigantic Pokémon... but they were defeated by a single young hero bearing a sword and shield. This statue here is meant to depict the young hero of that legend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We still don’t understand what kind of sword and shield the hero actually had. And what this “black storm” is supposed to be is just another mystery... Whatever it was, it blotted out the skies all across Galar. I suppose that tracks with it being called the Darkest Day, but still...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh... I suppose that hero must’ve been about as strong as Lee, then! Looks like you’re going to have your hands full with plenty to research, though, Sonia. Black storms and swords and shields and all...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be all right, Sonia!
Will you be all right, Sonia?
Heh, thanks! I’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
Course I will. I’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
You two are staying here at the hotel tonight, though, aren’t you? Shouldn’t you check in?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Probably so! And we’ll look out for you, too, Sonia. If we hear anything about any hero or whatnot, we’ll tell you![VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess we probably should head to the front desk to get checked in.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks for always taggin’ along with Hop. I hope you can keep it up. Leon really worries about him, too. He practically raised him, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]

We came all the way out to this big city so that we could properly cheer on Gym Challengers! Team Yell is here to help, after all! You’re in for a battle if you wanna stop us!
I’m up for that!
Sorry to bother you
Didn’t we tell you, mate? You get in our way, and you’re in for a battle! Team Yell’s all about helpin’... Helpin’ one very special Trainer win the Gym Challenge, that is! We wanna make sure she gets cheered on nice and proper... And now you’re gonna help us make some noise![VAR 0114(006F)]
Oi, gimme a break here! Team Yell! Get revenge for me, wouldja?[VAR 0114(006F)]
Course I’ve got you covered, mate! What could be better than a battle in a lovely hotel lobby?[VAR 0114(006F)]
Ah man! The swanky, sophisticated air in here had me off my game! I couldn’t keep my cool![VAR 0114(006F)]
I wasn’t expecting checking in would be such a big fuss, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What’s going on? Sneaking in some Pokémon battles without me?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t think you can get ahead of me that easily... I need to get some training in, so I’m joining! Here, I’ll even heal up your Pokémon, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m Hop, one of this year’s Gym Challengers! And the one who’s gonna be the next Champion! Now let’s have us a nice two-on-two![VAR 0114(0005)]
I can already hear my victory comin’! The only sound you’ll make is a whimper of defeat![VAR 0114(006F)]
Guess it was defeat that I heard comin’... I think I’m about to cry...[VAR 0114(006F)]
What are you lot doin’ here?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Marnie?![VAR 0114(006F)]
N-n-nothin’... We was just...[VAR 0114(006F)]
I know you all are terribly curious ’bout the other Gym Challengers, but you gotta show a bit of restraint.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sorry ’bout them! They’re just a bunch of my fans. Call themselves Team Yell and follow me around, cheerin’ for me. I think they’ve let it all go to their heads a bit...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come on, you lot! Back home with you now![VAR 0114(000D)]
They’re just so caught up with wantin’ to support me and all that they tend to get a bit shirty with other Gym Challengers. Sorry if they caused you any trouble.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So you’re a Gym Challenger, too? Team Yell, was it? Pretty impressive that you already have a set of fans to call your own![VAR 0114(0005)]

Gym Challengers can check in here, please!
Good evening and welcome to the Budew Drop Inn.
You must be one of the Pokémon Trainers entering the Gym Challenge?
Yes, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]... I see that the League has booked a room for you.
Oh look. And you have a sense of humor, too. Yes, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]... I see that the League has booked a room for you.
And if I might, thank you for helping us out of a sticky situation with those hooligans earlier. I hope you have a pleasant stay here with us. Sleep well.
This season is always the busiest, what with all the Gym Challengers and the tourists they draw.

Watch out, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ll beat you to Motostoke Stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
So the Gym Challenge is finally startin’. I’d wish you luck, but I’m afraid I’m goin’ to be the one to win.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I can’t wait for the first match! Pretty soon I’ll have so many fans, I’ll have to fight ’em off like Lee does![VAR 0114(0005)]

Gym Challenger, the opening ceremony is starting soon! Please allow me to escort you to the Gym Stadium.
Of course. You should have no problem making your own way through to the Gym Stadium, right?
All right, follow close and be careful not to lose sight of me!
We’ve made it to the stadium entrance! Please hurry to the opening ceremony!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0480

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], wasn’t it?
We must ask that Gym Challengers wear their uniforms for all official events. The opening ceremony marks the beginning of the Gym Challenge...so you know what that means! That’s right—I’ll need you to get changed as well!
Wonderful! You look sharp as a pin. And that [VAR 01C4(0001)] there... That really is the number for you!
Now we’re ready at last for the opening ceremony for this year’s Gym Challenge!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0490

Standing there on the pitch...in the stadium... in front of everyone! There’s really no words for it, but... I can barely contain myself! My heart’s racing![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 1]
[~ 2]
You’ve made it at last, Hop. And you, too, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
So you’re the two Trainers our Champion endorsed himself! Welcome, and it’s a delight to meet you! I’m Rose, of course.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, and what’s this?! I see you both already possess Dynamax Bands! How wonderful! It seems you two have been led here by the guiding light of the Wishing Stars. By the way, it was my wonderful company that invented those Dynamax Bands, you know![VAR 0114(0006)]
I daresay this year’s Gym Challenge is looking to be an absolute blast! Very good—very good indeed! That means the whole Galar region is in for some excitement![VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 7]
[~ 8]

The Gym Challenge is an excellent opportunity to show off your Dynamax Pokémon! Now, I’m terribly sorry, but there is some urgent business I need to attend to, so I must be on my way. The best of luck to both of you![VAR 0114(0006)]
The chairman certainly seems to be in high spirits! Now, listen closely, you two. You’ve both only just started on your path as Trainers. If you want to win, you need to do more than just train your Pokémon. You need to train yourselves, too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You know the Gym Challenge has a set order that you’ve gotta visit the Gyms in, right? The first is in Turffield! And to get there, we need to head to Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], the chairman asked me to deliver this gift to you.
A gift...such a wonderful thing... From the chairman...such a wonderful man...
*ahem* Excuse me. The gift is access to the Flying Taxis!
They allow you to, in a word, [VAR FF00(0001)]Fly[VAR FF00(0000)]! Calling a Flying Taxi will allow you to travel quickly back to areas you’ve already visited!
If it’s all right with you, I’ll read a segment from the Flying Taxi user’s manual. *ahem* “Press the X Button and select the Town Map option to choose the place you’d like to go to.”
Anyway, your next goal should be Turffield—isn’t that right, [VAR 0100(0000)]? When traveling to a new place, it’s best to get there on your own two legs, don’t you think?

There you are! I’ve been waiting! Let’s have a battle, you and me. We’ll get in a bit of training![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right!
But why?
I knew you’d be up for it! We’ve got to stay keener than anyone else if we want to steal the spotlight from our rivals![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seriously? This is the moment when you play along and act pumped up for battle! If you’ve gotta ask why we should bother training, you’ll never make it through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just what I’d expect from my rival! You know what? I’ll even give you one of my League Cards! That’s how good I think you did in that battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Our Gym Challenge starts right now—from here in Motostoke! Although the first Gym Leader we’ll have to challenge is in a town way far off from here... Still, you’d better believe I’m going to keep on winning my way to that Championship Match![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hello, Galar! Meet your next Champion! From the sleepy town of Postwick—it’s me, Hop![VAR 0114(0005)]

Heya, Gym Challenger! You looked real ace out there during the opening ceremony![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, but where’s Hop?[VAR 0114(000B)]
He went on ahead
He went a different way
He can’t sit still at all, can he? Guess he really wants to catch up to his brother.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, you’re rivals, after all. I guess it makes sense you’d train on your own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, I know! Let me tell you about something a bit interesting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You see that building over there? It’s a company owned by Chairman Rose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Just past Route 3, there’s a mine where they dig up ore. That building over there processes it into energy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
In other words, the chairman is responsible for providing the Galar region with its energy, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t say I really get him, but the chairman seems like a pretty brilliant guy, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here, a little something for having a chin-wag with me! It’s an Escape Rope.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll heal up your Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
The way to Turffield is pretty long, but that’s a kind of challenge in its own right. Good luck, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0540

Coming this way? I’d advise against it. Any Trainer with a Wishing Star is in for a beating from me and my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0042)]
You. You’re the Gym Challenger endorsed by the Champion, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
What a joke. You are aware that the chairman is more important than the Champion, right? I was chosen by the chairman himself, so that makes me more amazing than you![VAR 0114(0042)]
I suppose I should prove beyond doubt just how pathetic you are and how strong I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, that was unexpected. I suppose you’re more able than I thought.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally, I’ll remember your battle style and strategies now. I’m sure to easily defeat you if and when we face each other in an official match.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that we’ve established that, I won’t waste any more time on you. I’ve already gathered every Wishing Star in this area.

Wooloo! Where do you think you’re going?!
Beeeeeeh!
Wooloo crashed into you and stopped!
My... Are you OK? You took that Tackle head on...
Hmmm? Oh, you must be one of those Gym Challengers, right?
Yes, indeed!
No, I’m not
Ahhh, I thought so. I saw you at the opening ceremony.
Oh please, are you trying to have me on? I saw you at the opening ceremony!
My name’s Milo. I’m a Gym Leader and rather partial to Grass-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve been itching to see just how good the Champion-endorsed Gym Challengers are... Let me find out at the Gym Stadium! Just head on through this route, and you’ll run right into my stadium. See you there![VAR 0114(000E)]
Come on now. Back to the stadium with you, too! We can’t keep the Gym Challengers waiting![VAR 0114(000E)]

The Gym Leader just returned, too. Milo’s his name. But the place is jam-packed with challengers. It’ll be ages before our turn comes up...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh... But Sonia was looking for you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. She wanted to ask you about something. She tried asking me, but I had no idea. She’s up on that what’s-her-face hill. You know the one.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What? You don’t know the hill? Well, have a look at your map if you’re not sure![VAR 0114(0005)]

Sonia’s probably still waiting for you at the hill, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Go on and meet her. You can’t take on Milo yet anyway, and I don’t want her griping to me later as if I didn’t pass on the message![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome, Gym Challenger! Allow me to help you through your registration.
First things first—how about a quick refresher about the Gym Challenge? Your goal as a Gym Challenger is to complete each Gym mission, defeat every Gym Leader, and gather eight Gym Badges!
Got it!
Gym missions?
So, would you like to attempt the Gym mission?
Let’s do it!
One moment...
The [VAR FF00(0001)]Gym mission[VAR FF00(0000)] is a sort of test you need to go through before facing the Gym Leader. Each Gym has a different mission for challengers.
If you would like to attempt the Gym mission, please change into your uniform!
Then let the Gym mission begin! Give it your best shot!
You’re here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite words is perseverance!
Congratulations! You’ve completed the Gym mission! Don’t get too confident, though. Your teamwork with your Pokémon is key when battling the Gym Leader!
Oh, of course! Please come back anytime once you’re ready to attempt the mission!
[~ 13]
[~ 14]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0580
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mission given by Turffield’s Pokémon Gym is this!
To chase our unruly Wooloo!
To that blockade we’ve made from our bales of straw over there!
Oh, by the way, you can call me Dan. I serve as a referee, and it’s also my job to report the results of battles to the League HQ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Then on with you! And good luck!
Chase after the Wooloo, and gather them by the blockade made of straw bales! If you do, they’ll break through the blockade, and you’ll be able to carry on ahead.
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Now you must face the Gym Leader, Milo, in a Pokémon battle!
I hope you’ll remember your battle with Milo every time you look at that Grass Badge!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
You’ve cleared the first blockade!
You’ve cleared the second blockade! Two more to go—you’re halfway there!
Would you look at that! Defeating the Trainers seems to have settled that Yamper down, too!
Brilliant! You’ve made it through three blockades! Just one last obstacle remains!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0590
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My Gym’s the first one people face, so we get a lot of challengers. That’s why I try to keep the Gym mission challenging, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
that didn’t stop you from completing it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Proper job![VAR 0114(000E)]
Sure seems like you understand Pokémon real well. This is gonna be a doozy of a battle! I’ll have to [VAR FF00(0001)]Dynamax[VAR FF00(0000)] my Pokémon if I want to win![VAR 0114(000E)]
That must have been a fulfilling Pokémon battle for you![VAR 0114(000E)]
As proof that you have defeated a Gym Leader for the Gym Challenge, allow me to present you with your very own Grass Badge![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 25!
You need to obtain all eight Gym Badges in order to complete the Gym Challenge. And the only way to gather the Badges is to defeat every Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! My most sincere congratulations on defeating Gym Leader Milo! Please accept this TM to commemorate your victory.
Here, you can have Milo’s uniform to go with it! It’s a replica, of course.
The Grass Badge looks good on you! Keep at it, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!

Thanks, Yamper![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wow wow!
I had you come ’cause I wanted to hear what you thought.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, that geoglyph... What do you think of it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Darkest Day?
Dynamax?
Right perceptive of you. Especially since the portion depicting the black storm has mostly disappeared.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Seems likely... It certainly looks like a gigantic Pokémon. I suppose people three thousand years ago could’ve just imagined this, but it looks too similar to Dynamax. It can’t just be coincidence.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A long time ago...a great black storm covered the Galar region. Giant Pokémon ran rampant... But what was that black storm they called “the Darkest Day”? What connection does it have to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Guess I’m the lucky lady who’ll be looking into that... Gran sure gives me a lot to do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for your thoughts on the matter! As thanks, I’ll give you a League Card.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Milo’s a Grass-type Gym Leader. Things will go well for you if you use Fire-, Flying-, or Bug-type moves. Take these, too! It’d be pretty bad if your Pokémon weren’t in fighting form![VAR 0114(000B)]
Go on, then! Get yourself to Turffield Stadium and battle yourself silly![VAR 0114(000B)]

Take a look at this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Grass Gym Badge! I got it in one try![VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon I’m just about the greatest when it comes to wrangling Wooloo... I’ve had plenty of practice at it, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m sure you can win this one, too. After all, you are my rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0616
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some advice for you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. The Gym Challenge has a set order you’ll need to follow.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So that means your next stop should be in Hulbury to meet Nessa. Hulbury’s just beyond Route 5. Or since you’ve got the Grass Badge, you could head to the Wild Area. It’s a bit tricky to catch Pokémon that are a higher level than the Pokémon on your team, but they make powerful allies if you succeed![VAR 0114(000E)]

Oi! Just hand over that bike already! We need it to cross this long bridge![VAR 0114(006F)]
We’re gonna use that bike to chase around Gym Challengers! It’ll be a scream![VAR 0114(006F)]
How barbaric! It wouldn’t work anyway. You don’t even have a Rotom with you!
Hey, young Gym Challenger! They’re trying to steal my bike! Please, if you could give them a good thrashing, I would be in your debt!
Oi, we’re not tryin’ to steal the bike! Only borrow it! We’re gonna use it to chase after Gym Challengers and make ’em all tired! But I’m thinkin’ you deserve a special shout-out. I’m gonna crush you in a battle![VAR 0114(006F)]
Gah... You crushed my attempt to crush you.[VAR 0114(006F)]
Why you... I want that bike! Don’t get in my way![VAR 0114(006F)]
You’re too strong! If you stay in the Gym Challenge, you’re gonna cause problems for our lady! You ’aven’t seen the last of us! We’re gonna make sure you stay out of our lady’s way![VAR 0114(006F)]
My word, you’re quite the Trainer! And I see you have a Pokédex, too! That means you have a Rotom with you! Fantastic! I think I’ll give this bike to you, then. Better you have it than Team Yell!
Now, you know that Rotom love motors very, very much, right? Enough to jump right into machines that have motors! So, that got me thinking... If I attached a motor to a bicycle, then maybe I could get a Rotom to pop into that as well!
Right...
I see
Come now—give it a shot! Enjoy cycling together with Rotom to the fullest.
Chop, chop, come on now! You and Rotom ride that bicycle together!
I’ll read the manual. “Press the + Button or - Button to ride your bike with Rotom. Let’s get cycling!”

No need to rush off! I can still do more autographs! I’ll even give you my Pokémon League Card![VAR 0114(0006)]
We need the support of our fans to keep doing what we’re doing. Chasing them off like that... Aren’t you being a bit too harsh, Oleana?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Fans are very important, of course. That’s why you need to keep doing your work— for their sake.[VAR 0114(0007)]

That’s right! Bede! I daresay I’m impressed how far you’ve come since I gave you that Pokémon all those years ago.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Will you be the one to win the Gym Challenge? Or perhaps it will be one of the Trainers endorsed by the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I will prove your faith in me was well placed, Chairman. I won’t lose to anyone! Anyway, I will be on my way now.[VAR 0114(000C)]

Ah! I just had a good idea, as I tend to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re going to face Gym Leader Nessa soon, yes? If you get a Gym Badge from her, I’ll hold a celebration. I’d like to get to know you a little better, after all![VAR 0114(0006)]
Chairman, we should really be going...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please do your best, for the sake of Galar’s future![VAR 0114(0006)]

Understood! Please come back whenever you’re ready.
That’s right! You’ll have to change into your uniform. The changing room is located over there.
All right, you’re in your uniform! Head on in to the Gym mission! Ah, by the way, while you’re on the Gym mission, you can’t use your Pokémon Box Link.
Ah, well, you see...Leader Nessa is actually out by the lighthouse right now. Would you mind going to get her? The lighthouse is toward the ocean, after you exit the stadium.
Ah, the Gym mission, right? Don’t give up! My favorite saying is “the persistent raindrops will carve through stone”!
[~ 8]
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] has already cleared the Gym mission, and will now face Gym Leader Nessa!
Understood! We will eagerly await your return to challenge the Gym again.

The Hulbury Pokémon Gym’s mission is this! A challenging maze! And you must reach the goal to clear the mission!
However, some paths in the maze are blocked by water. What should you do then?
Try pressing that red button over there, and I imagine you’ll figure it out, future champ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Press the buttons to change the flow of the falling water, and try to reach the goal!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Then on with you! And good luck!

Welcome, honored Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000F)]
I think you already realize, but I’m Nessa. Sorry to have made you look for me.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t doubt my humble mission’s difficulty... Yet you cleared it. Your mind as a Pokémon Trainer must be quite refined.[VAR 0114(000F)]
No matter what kind of plan your refined mind may be plotting, my partner and I will be sure to sink it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
How...? How can this be?![VAR 0114(000F)]
*sigh* Now that I’ve battled you, I think I understand.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Continue to seize victories in the Gym Challenge with your Pokémon. You have an incredible spirit that may even be strong enough to challenge the Champion.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You and your Pokémon are indeed deserving of this Gym Badge.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 30!
You’ll want to challenge the Fire Gym Leader next. As you and your Pokémon are now, he’ll definitely want to battle you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! My sincere congratulations for your victory over Gym Leader Nessa. Please take this commemorative TM.
Take this, too. It’s a replica of Nessa’s uniform!
Now that you’ve won the Water Badge, I’ll be watching to see just how far you and your Pokémon can go!
You’ve defeated the Gym Leader, Nessa! My sincerest congratulations!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
You decided to return to the reception desk.

Do not keep the chairman waiting. Head to the seafood restaurant—the Captain’s Table. So you will not forget the chairman’s face, I will give you one of his League Cards.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Chairman Rose is the kind of man who gets downhearted if he doesn’t take care of things he needs to right away... Go to the seafood restaurant as soon as possible, so as not to keep the chairman waiting.[VAR 0114(0007)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s celebrate your recent victory![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, were you invited, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two know each other? That’s great! Come now—please be seated.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hulbury is a seafood town. Naturally, if one is going to eat here, the obvious choice is the local cuisine! Everything on the menu is delicious.[VAR 0114(0006)]
By the way, how is Professor Magnolia getting on?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m quite indebted to her, you know. She was the one who figured out how to unleash the power of Wishing Stars and use that power to Dynamax Pokémon. We would never have been able to create Dynamax Bands without her.[VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh* She was saying that there’s still so much we don’t know about Dynamaxing. It’s causing her some worry.[VAR 0114(000B)]
She even made me take a Power Spot Detector with me when I started traveling...[VAR 0114(000B)]
A Power Spot Detector! That’s the device that allowed me to discover the Power Spots... Locations that emit Galar particles and allow Pokémon to Dynamax![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t like hearing that Professor Magnolia is so worried, though. If only there were something I could do...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sonia, it may be good for you to visit the vault in Hammerlocke. I believe the key to unlocking the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon lies in the history preserved there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Understood, Chairman. I will arrange a meeting with Ms. Sonia.[VAR 0114(0007)]
However, I believe it is about time we get going, Chairman.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hm? But I’ve hardly had a chance to speak with [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s regrettable, but I suppose it can’t be helped. If something needs to get done, there’s no time like the present, after all! In any case, I bid you all farewell![VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh* Does he think he’s doing me a favor? He’s right that the vault would be a good place to look for info on the legends, but...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You got the Water Badge, yeah? Defeating Nessa’s no small feat. Here’s a TM as a reward![VAR 0114(000B)]
Nessa’s a good friend. Perhaps I should drop in on her. Until next time, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]

All right, mate! You’ve got both the Grass Badge and the Water Badge by now, right? In that case, we’re both headed for Motostoke and the Fire Gym Leader, Kabu![VAR 0114(0005)]
How about I share with you a little tip about that Leader Kabu? From what I heard, he’s holed up now in Galar Mine No. 2, undergoing some special training![VAR 0114(0005)]
If he’s in there, then we can’t take him on in Motostoke even if we zip right over there— putting the brakes on our Gym Challenge. So I say we head to Galar Mine No. 2 ourselves! Let’s go see what all the fuss is about![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0701
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go, go, Marnie. Let’s go! Go, go, Marnie. Let’s go! The only Trainer that gets cheered on by Team Yell is Marnie![VAR 0114(0043)]
Any other Gym Challenger can shove off! If you don’t like it, you can go sulk in Galar Mine No. 2![VAR 0114(0044)]
So you can forget about gettin’ on the train! You’ll have to make your way through Galar Mine No. 2 if you wanna get anywhere![VAR 0114(0043)]

You again...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’d feel sorry for my Pokémon if I made them take part in a battle against low-level opponents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not in the mood to deal with weaklings right now. Then again, I suppose it’s a form of mercy to crush weak opponents early on.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If you’re under the misguided impression that you’re stronger than me, then surely you would be up for a Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally!
Hold on a minute...
It’s utterly inconceivable that I, the challenger chosen by the chairman, will lose![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmph! I’ve no time to deal with pathetic Trainers![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, pardon me. It seems I must take back my words. You’re not weak—you just lack talent. Your chances of completing the Gym Challenge are pretty slim, I must say. Here, I’ll give you this. Something to show you at least tried.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, where shall I go next to collect Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m just gonna keep my mouth shut... Otherwise, his Pokémon will just knock me down again... Nah, not doin’ that...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m havin’ me a lovely little dream... A dream where I actually won the battle...[VAR 0114(0044)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0720
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
’Scuse me, mate, sorry to bother you... You’re one of them takin’ part in the Gym Challenge, right?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Crikey, but that’s really somethin’! I’d love a battle against a great Trainer like you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Surrounded by adoring fans, eh? You’ll even be showing up Lee pretty soon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oi, jog on, mate! Can’t you see we’re in the middle of a conversation here?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah? And can’t you see that I’m Hop, the Trainer who’ll be your next Champion?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oooh, so we’ve got a joker here, eh? You’re so funny, I forgot to laugh.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You think I’m joking? I’ll prove it, then! And I think a battle with you lot would definitely end with some laughs![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s take ’em on together, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You ready, mate?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The two of us were endorsed by the Champion himself! We’ll show you just what that means![VAR 0114(0005)]
Got it! Then get yourself all ready for a good battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, if you insist... Team Yell’s gonna teach you kids that the Gym Challenge’s no joke! You better not be yell-ow![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’d this other kid have to come waltzin’ up for, eh? I just wanted to knock off challengers one at a time...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s my rival for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now then... Where could Kabu have gone off to? Let’s keep going. Maybe he’s farther in![VAR 0114(0005)]
That little mug’s the Champion’s little brother... Guess that’s what you get when your older brother’s not useless...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I know we’re Team Yell, but we’ll leave quietly once we’re beaten...[VAR 0114(0044)]

Look at you, little chap! Who’s a rugged, rocky little love? You are, Carkol. You’re my little rubble-wubble![VAR 0114(0043)]
Gor?
Oi, can’t you see me spendin’ some quality time here with my beloved Carkol? You’re not tryin’ to disturb us, are you? If you are, I’ll just have to make it clear you’re not welcome![VAR 0114(0043)]
I was the strongest one in Galar Mine No. 2, but now my spot’s been taken...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s your problem, eh? Here we had the brilliant idea to block the path while passin’ the time showin’ Carkol a bit of love, and then you come along![VAR 0114(0044)]
Retreat! That’s it, lads! Leave the Pokémon behind and leg it![VAR 0114(005E)]
Cleared them right off, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, have I got this straight? Those fanatics were only in our way...so they could spend a bit of time playing with Carkol?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph. It seems I made the right decision, letting the rabble deal with the rabble. The only thing weak Trainers like yourselves are good for is clearing my path.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sorry you had to deal with that, Carkol. Were you in the middle of a Poké Job, then? Go on! Break those rocks, and hurry back safe to your Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]
Goooooor!
Actually... You two aren’t even all that useful in clearing my path, compared to that Pokémon. Still, I suppose you did take care of Team Yell. Here’s something for your trouble.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rrrgh! That little—![VAR 0114(0005)]
Do you suppose that Carkol found its way back to its Trainer all right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, I wonder... Where has Kabu wandered off to?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you for helping out with my training, Team Yell! But I must say... it’s unforgivable for you to get in the way of a Carkol hard at work![VAR 0114(0010)]
We weren’t gettin’ in its way! We were tryin’ to cheer it on![VAR 0114(0043)]
Still, you did a number on us in that Pokémon battle, so...it’s time for Team Yell to scarper and give a morale boost elsewhere![VAR 0114(0044)]
Goooooor!
Cheering is one thing, but one shouldn’t get in the way of honest work![VAR 0114(0010)]
That’s Kabu... Man, he’s wicked! No wonder he’s the Fire-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, you are the Trainers endorsed by Leon! Hop and [VAR 0100(0000)], am I right? I’m just training right up until the last moment so that I can guarantee the perfect match when I face you Gym Challengers![VAR 0114(0010)]
I specialize in Fire-type Pokémon, and the Water-type Pokémon in Galar Mine No. 2 are the perfect opponents to train against![VAR 0114(0010)]
Regardless, it’s getting late. Just go straight once you get out of this mine, and you’ll reach Motostoke. Get a good rest at the hotel, and make sure you’re both in your top condition![VAR 0114(0010)]
Come on, Carkol. Time for you to head on home, too. I’ll make sure you get there safely.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Gooor!
We’re going to be on fire tomorrow![VAR 0114(0010)]
I remember Lee talking about Kabu. He said that a lot of Gym Challengers give up because they just can’t beat Kabu.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Man, now I’m getting all fired up, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0740
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That Carkol from before... I guess it must’ve been here on a job. You do know about Poké Jobs by now, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do
Poké what?
Course you do![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like there’s no helping it, in that case... Settle down and let Professor Hop teach you a thing or two! Let’s see if I can remember what Lee had written down in his old notebooks... Basically, you can have your Pokémon go about and help companies or other folks who are in need of something. You can take Poké Jobs from the Rotomi at any Pokémon Center, so give it a look sometime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, I’m cream-crackered! I’m for the Budew Drop Inn and some sleep. Come tomorrow, that Fire Gym Leader Kabu better be ready, because I’ll be coming for him![VAR 0114(0005)]
Burning the midnight oil, are we? If you’re here for the Gym Challenge, you won’t be able to challenge Kabu till the morning.
For now, it’d be best to simply get yourself a good night’s rest at the Budew Drop Inn!

I’m doin’ some visualization trainin’. My battle with Kabu’s tomorrow. So, I thought if I came here and had a look at the stadium, I’d get some ideas for a strategy.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just ’cause you were chosen by the Champion, doesn’t mean I’m gonna lose to you! In fact, I’ll keep winnin’, and I’ll have a proper go at the Champion, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]

That friend of yours already went off to challenge the next Gym. Kabu’s League Card is supposed to help against him, but I ended up with a few copies, so I’ll give you one. Don’t look so chuffed. It’s no big deal.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, help with somethin’ for a sec. I want t’see if I’m ready for the next leg of the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hmm... Looks like I’ll need to raise Morpeko and the others a little more. Not much of a thank-you, but I can heal up your team, at least.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Take this, too... A little somethin’ for our battle yesterday.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Bet you’ll have no trouble beatin’ that “man of fire” Kabu chap, right? Why don’cha get over to Motostoke Stadium and get that Gym Badge already?[VAR 0114(000D)]

That man of fire Kabu is just what you’d expect. Nearly got burnt in my battle with him! Even with my strongest team, it was definitely touch-and-go...but I still won in the end![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get a shift on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I bet you could beat the man of fire, too![VAR 0114(0005)]

A Gym Challenger! Ah, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu, you’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in Turffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger! And you’ve even earned your first two Badges! But I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to Galar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special training with his team. You might want to head to Hulbury and try to catch him in the mines on the way back here.
Hey, a Gym Challenger! That’s a welcome sight! We don’t have too many challengers, since our Leader Kabu has made his Gym mission so hard... But I’ll be happy to get you registered at once!
I’m ready!
Not yet
Roger that! I’ll be here, so come back when you’re ready to challenge our Gym!
If you’re here to challenge our Gym, we’ll ask you to change into your uniform first...
Congratulations on clearing the Gym mission! You had that one in the bag, eh? Next up will be your match against Leader Kabu. I wonder which one of you will burn brighter?
You may find the Fire Gym’s mission a bit different than others you’ve faced. In you go!
Please take this TM to commemorate what you accomplished here today!
And take one of our uniforms. It’s the same design as Kabu himself wears.
Few enough people challenge Leader Kabu, and even fewer manage to defeat him... It’ll be a treat to see how such a promising Trainer does in the Gym Challenge!
Back for our Gym mission, are you? Good luck racking up those points!
[~ 13]

The Gym mission for the Fire Gym is this! Catching Pokémon to earn the most points!
Earn five points to clear the Gym mission! In case you were wondering, you’ll earn one point for defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass or two points for catching a Pokémon. But you won’t be alone in this competition. Other Trainers will be joining you in your battles!
Think about what your opponents might do, and try to take the best action to rack up points!
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Get five points to clear the mission! Defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass gets you one point, but catching a Pokémon gets you two!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Well done! That’s the way to clear a Gym mission!
Next you’ll be facing Kabu, the leader of the Fire Gym! On you go, Challenger!
Right you are! Then on you go, Challenger!
A cautious one, are you? Get yourself all sorted first, in that case.
Then on with you! And good luck!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission completed!
Clearing Leader Kabu’s Gym mission like that... You’re positively on fire!
Congratulations on another mission cleared!
[~ 20]
Now [VAR 0200(0001)] more point[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s needed to clear the Fire Gym mission! Keep that fire burning! (Gym Leader Kabu)

Oh my word, is Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] really going to end this thing with naught?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Your target is the wild Pokémon! Don’t concern yourself with the other Trainers!
The other Gym Trainers are all stronger than me! Be careful out there!
Status conditions are the greatest! Getting burned will land you in real hot water!
A Full Heal can cure any sort of status condition!
Study the situation, and choose your opponent wisely based on it!
We won’t let you get through the Fire Gym’s mission that easily!

Welcome! I am Kabu, the Fire-type Gym Leader. The fact that you are here means you’ve bested both Milo’s Grass-type Pokémon and Nessa’s Water types, too. That’s quite an accomplishment![VAR 0114(0010)]
Every Trainer and Pokémon trains hard in pursuit of victory. But that means your opponent is also working hard to win. In the end, the match is decided by which side is able to unleash their true potential.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m often regarded as the first real roadblock of the Gym Challenge, and yet you defeated me! Clearly, your talent surpassed my many years of experience. I still have much to learn![VAR 0114(0010)]
I know now that you and your Pokémon will become a fantastic team. I’m glad I could battle you today![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let me give you a Fire Badge as proof that you’ve defeated me![VAR 0114(0010)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 35!
Thanks to the Dynamax phenomenon, our Pokémon battles have become part of the Galar region’s culture.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And it’s the young Trainers who are responsible for keeping our culture alive. Of course, I hope that instead of just keeping it alive, you also help it become something better. We adults will be the pillars for you to build on.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! I see you’ve done a fine job collecting the Gym Badges from the Grass, Water, and Fire Gyms.
I think you’ve proven your skill well enough to try your hand against the Gyms that await you, starting in the city of Hammerlocke.
Head back down into the Wild Area surrounding this city, then make your way to Hammerlocke!
With all the Badges we’ve earned ourselves, I reckon we should be all right even against the fierce Pokémon you find deep in the Wild Area. Let’s go find out for ourselves![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hurry it up, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re the Gym Leader, but you still came all the way to see us off? Oh, I bet you can already tell that I’m the one who’ll become the next Champion, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are many Trainers who never manage to gather three Gym Badges, and they just give up on the Gym Challenge altogether... So I make a point to see off any Trainers who are able to defeat me.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Whew, we made it... Thank goodness for Flying Taxis![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Hop, congratulations! It’s pretty amazing you two defeated Kabu![VAR 0114(000F)]
Not a lot of Gym Challengers are able to get a Gym Badge from Kabu. We like to get together to see them off, as a way of showing our support.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So, allow me to send you off with a proper, sporty chant![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hustle, hustle, hustle, Hop! You can do it, you can do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
The Gym Leaders you will face ahead are all tough opponents. But I believe that you will prevail! Believe in your Pokémon and keep pushing on![VAR 0114(0010)]
Thanks, you all! We’re gonna keep winning! We’ve got to if we want a face-off in the Champion Cup, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s head for Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Look into yourself for things you lack. Those who understand their own weaknesses learn and grow the most![VAR 0114(0010)]
You run into a lot of unexpected things when you work as a farmer. Same thing with Pokémon battles. Just don’t give up and things will work out.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s nothing wrong with stoically facing challenges, but push yourselves too hard, and you’ll pop. If you ever feel maxed out, come up for a breather at the seafood restaurant.[VAR 0114(000F)]

And, yeah, you could certainly rush straight there without a single detour...[VAR 0114(0005)]
but now that you and I have a few Gym Badges, we should be able to catch stronger Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I know what I’m doing. I’ll be catching myself some amazing Pokémon to fill in the next page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]

Don’t waste your efforts. It’s not like either of you would ever make it through the Gym Challenge, anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The Champion really must have been off his rocker to endorse the likes of you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I mean, it seems Hop here can’t even throw a Poké Ball properly.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rubbish. More like you don’t know enough to recognize greatness when you see it. My throws are the greatest, and my bro is the finest Champion the world has ever seen! I’m not gonna listen to you insulting him![VAR 0114(0005)]
How tiresome... Fine. I’ll battle you over there. Maybe that will help you finally understand just how weak you are.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You’re on then. I know you challenged [VAR 0100(0000)] to battle in Galar Mine No. 2 and lost to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer there. And I’m h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser greatest rival. In other words...there’s no way you’re beating me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
All this prattle about [VAR 0100(0000)] and the Champion and whatnot... Do you not have anything of your own to show?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll show this wally my real skills in battle! So, see you later, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s meet up in Hammerlocke when I’m through with him![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ah, a Gym Challenger! Allow me to check your Gym Badges!
The Grass Badge!
The Water Badge!
And the Fire Badge!
It’s confirmed that you’ve defeated three Gym Leaders, including the leader of Motostoke! I wish you the best of luck in your future battles!
Oh, it’s you... I doubt Hop will be coming.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s only natural. After such a humiliating defeat, there’s no way he could look the Champion in the eye. I’m sure he’ll withdraw from the challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here, just look at the Gym Badges I’ve already won.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you, Challenger Bede. I can confirm you have the required Badges!
Anyway, I have a meeting with the chairman, so I must excuse myself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet. You can’t enter without the Fire Badge. Would you like me to take you back to the bridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Of course. In that case...
Please don’t overexert yourself.

Mr. Chairman! I’ve been collecting both Wishing Stars and Gym Badges as fast as I can![VAR 0114(000C)]
Good work, Bede. I’m glad you haven’t forgotten that it was the chairman who endorsed you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
If I gather enough Wishing Stars, that’ll help solve the problem that’s been bothering you, right, Mr. Chairman?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, it’s not just about me. It’s for the future of the whole Galar region.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And we’ll need more than just Wishing Stars. We need a powerful Pokémon Trainer, too— someone like the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
With all due respect, sir, I was able to show Hop, one of the Champion-endorsed Trainers, just how outclassed he was.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sure I’ll be able to defeat the Champion. No, I WILL defeat the Champion![VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s the spirit! It takes healthy competition to really keep the Gym Challenge energized![VAR 0114(0006)]
Challenger Bede, there is something I wish to discuss with you. Do you have a moment?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I hope you were listening, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
As you know, Wishing Stars are those mysterious stones that are even attached to your Dynamax Bands.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s more to Wishing Stars than just making your Pokémon into giants, though! They hold far more energy than that![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you’re curious, you should head to the stadium. In fact, we should head inside right away! I’ll even give you a little lesson on how the Galar region gets its energy![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hammerlocke’s stadium doubles as an Energy Plant.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, have a look at my tablet. I’ve got all the information you need on it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
See? An easy-to-understand description of the Energy Plant!
First, energy is absorbed from Hammerlocke Stadium’s tower...
Then, it’s changed into electricity in the underground power plant and delivered to people throughout the region!
Our lives and society require various types of energy sources, such as electricity, natural gas, and water.[VAR 0114(0006)]
My associate groups aim to improve everyone’s lives by harnessing the power stored in Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! It’s time for me to get to work. I should get a move on before Oleana decides to give me another earful.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I suggest you head over to the vault next. Just head toward Route 6 from the stadium, and you should find the vault without any issues![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0880
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Seems you’re doing well collecting Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But Hop... Did something happen with him? He was acting really odd when I ran into him. He took one look at me and immediately was like, “I’m so sorry, Lee!” It might be the first time I’ve heard him apologize for anything, and I’ve no idea what it was for![VAR 0114(0004)]
Maybe he’s feeling down because he’s had some hard losses in battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
He lost to that Challenger Bede
I think so
When you lose, you feel down in the dumps. But then there’s nowhere left to go but back up! You’ve got to think on why it was you lost, though. You know, that little brother of mine...I think he might yet become a surprisingly great Trainer![VAR 0114(0004)]
At least I’ve got you to keep an eye on him. You will look out for Hop, won’t you? As his rival.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Blast, and look at the time! Nearly forgot my meeting with the chairman. That Oleana really lets me hear it when I’m late! Now if only I could remember which way to go...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, I’d say that you should go and say hello to Raihan while you’re here, [VAR 0100(0000)]. He’s the greatest rival I’ve got and the final hurdle you’ll have to face in the Gym Challenge. He should still be around the vault, if you hurry. It’s down that way—on the way to Route 6.[VAR 0114(0004)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0890
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh! If it isn’t the Trainer endorsed by the Champion! Let’s see... What was your name again?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, right! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
And if Leon himself recognized your potential... then I guess you’ll grow into quite the Trainer. All the same, though, anyone wanting to challenge the mighty Raihan has to prove they’re up to it by earning seven Gym Badges first.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I already knew that
I’m here to visit the vault
Ah, so you’re here to see our treasures, are you? Gaining a better understanding of Pokémon by studying history certainly isn’t a bad idea.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I like your spirit, kid! Follow me, why don’t you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll even spare you one of my League Cards.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now on you go! If it’s the vault you want, it’s up those stairs there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Weren’t you here to see the vault? That girl’s up there, too. You know. Miss Clever Clogs.[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you want your chance to battle the great Raihan for yourself, collect those Gym Badges! You’ll need seven of them—and the next is waiting for you in Stow-on-Side, down Route 6.[VAR 0114(0017)]

Oh, you’re here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Brilliant, aren’t they? It’s great that there are still treasured tapestries that can tell us of Galar’s history.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The two youths watching a Wishing Star.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A disaster occurs... The two bewildered youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths looking on at the sword and shield that stop the disaster.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths being crowned.[VAR 0114(000B)]
These tapestries tell the story of the creation of a kingdom in Galar.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, young Gym Challenger, what sticks out to you most about them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s two heroes?
The Darkest Day?
Bang on! The statue at that hotel in Motostoke only had one hero, no matter how you slice it. But here, we clearly have two youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right? That’s got to be it. The story of the black storm that blotted out the skies was passed on through the years as a tale of disaster... That’s what the Darkest Day is![VAR 0114(000B)]
Was there really only one hero, or were there two? And what even caused the Darkest Day?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for letting me bounce some ideas off you. I think I’ve got some theories now. I’m going to research the tapestries a tad more, but you have your Gym Challenge, right? I’m cheering for you, so take a couple of these. I hope to see more of your wins![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whatever happened to the sword and shield that drove off the disaster?[VAR 0114(000B)]

The tapestries in the vault depict the heroes of the Galar region’s past. I suppose if we’ve got any modern hero, it’d have to be our Champion, Leon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Your goal is to defeat that superstar Leon. So go conquer Route 6 and train yourself up along the way to Stow-on-Side![VAR 0114(0017)]

What a cute Silicobra.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Just look at those adorable eyes.[VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s our duty as Team Yell to make sure Silicobra gets a nice, peaceful sleep![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hello there. If I promise not to wake the Pokémon, will you let me through?
Of course! It’d be our pleasure.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You’re heading to Stow-on-Side, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oi, Team Yell. Don’t suppose you’ll let us through?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Nah, you kids are way too loud. Can’t be lettin’ you through. An’ we’re particularly not fond of kids wearin’ the Challenge Band![VAR 0114(0043)]
With all your stompin’ around, Silicobra is sure to wake up![VAR 0114(0044)]
Right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]? If we don’t get past them, we won’t be able to continue our Gym Challenge at Stow-on-Side...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll battle them!
Let me think...
You... Yeah, that’s the spirit![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t figure thinking at them is going to change much about the situation. What else you got?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are way too noisy. You don’t wanna wake up Silicobra, now do you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I swear, kids these days... Well, we’ve got no choice. We have to send you packin’. It’s all for the sake of Silicobra![VAR 0114(0043)]
Think I’ll leave this to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Keep up the pace.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Silicobra might wake up after all that ruckus![VAR 0114(0044)]
Then there’s no point in us stickin’ around! Let’s get out of here! We’ll make these bothersome kids holler some other day![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... You and [VAR 0101(0001)] were brilliant together![VAR 0114(0005)]
See, Bede really wiped the floor with me the last time we battled... And don’t get me wrong—I can take a loss! Battling means you’ve got to lose sometimes.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But he said that I was dragging Lee’s good name through the mud, being so rubbish like I was... And I just can’t get those words out of my head![VAR 0114(0005)]
If I’m weak, then people’ll think Lee’s weak, too... But I don’t want that! I can’t let Lee get dragged down! He’s the unbeatable Champion! I’m gonna have to take some time figuring this out. See you around, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hsss...

But the only thing I can do is get stronger, right? So I’m gonna try out all kinds of different things against you and see what works![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re on!
Wait a second...
Then let’s do this! I bet an all-out battle with my true rival will help me get my head on straight![VAR 0114(0005)]
What? Your rival is depressed over here, and you won’t lift a finger to help?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hrmmm... I tried switching my team members in and out to max out their potential in every matchup, but... We just couldn’t get it together somehow... Maybe that’s why I’m still so weak...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But Lee really is the greatest Trainer! And I don’t want people to be laughing at him all because his little brother is rubbish![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s not enough! I’ve got to try harder! And harder and harder till no one’s laughing! I’m off, mate! Off to find the kind of Pokémon that I can really draw the strength out of![VAR 0114(0005)]

But not good, either. And I think I know why. You need more pink. Here, have a look at this League Card. Maybe it’ll inspire you to add a little more pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I plan on putting you both to the test soon, so you better not slack off on your training![VAR 0114(0013)]
That child...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gym Challengers should battle for the sake of their own Pokémon. Why worry about saving the Champion’s name? We all know he’s unbeatable.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, here’s something for letting me watch your battle.[VAR 0114(0013)]

To complete the mission, you’ll need to ride in one of these cups and make your way to the goal while trying to avoid obstacles!
Let me tell you a bit more about how to operate this fun attraction. Rotate your control stick to the right and the cup will start to spin to the right. Rotate it to the left to make the cup spin left!
If you hit a wall, rotate the stick as quick as you can to get yourself out of that sticky situation! Now, have a good time watching the world spin as you try to reach the goal!
Then on you spin! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Use the control stick to spin your cup, and make your way to the goal!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?

Thank you for the battle.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Phew... Facing you gave me all the explanation I needed.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Battling against you and your team... I hadn’t expected it, but it made my heart dance. It’s good to be unshakable in the face of battle. But it’s good to be moved by battle, as well.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you again. Take the Fighting Badge.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 40!
I hope that you’ll meet many more Trainers and have many more matches in the future. And I hope that every one of those encounters will nourish your spirit.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! Congratulations on defeating Leader Bea! Please take this TM to remember your victory by!

You tend to have surprisingly sharp insight, so I was wondering what you might think when you see the ruins.[VAR 0114(000B)]

So you think that you can start collecting Wishing Stars now and get in the chairman’s favor? That’s the way of things, is it? I see. So you do have some cunning in you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I won’t have it! I won’t allow anyone to stand in my way![VAR 0114(000C)]
But why...? How can this be? How could someone like you get in my way?[VAR 0114(000C)]

I was the one chosen by the chairman... I was the one who was to defeat the Champion... I’m one of the elite—someone who can shoulder the future of the Galar region![VAR 0114(000C)]
Challenger Bede![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wondered what you were up to when you asked to borrow Chairman Rose’s Copperajah... I can’t believe you’d try to use the chairman’s Pokémon to destroy a historical site![VAR 0114(0007)]
Who cares for some ancient ruin when the next thousand years are at stake?! Did you stand in the path of a Pokémon’s Simple Beam or something? How do you expect to support the chairman with that sort of thinking?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Young Bede...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It pains me to have to say this, but... I am truly disappointed. It’s true that I am the one who found you, back when you were all alone...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I saw talent in you. You reminded me a little bit of myself, back when I was young. That’s why I sent you to a Trainers’ school, to give you a chance at success.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But trying to destroy the mural—part of Galar’s history! You show no love toward Galar! You are clearly not a worthy challenger for the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We will decide what to do with you later. For now, you will return to Hammerlocke.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You...you must be joking, right? You’re disqualifying me from the Gym Challenge? But you’re the one who endorsed me! There are a hundred different ways we could sort this out... Why are you choosing the worst possible option?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Challenger Bede. I will be taking those Wishing Stars that you have gathered.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, Sonia! And [VAR 0100(0000)], too. Terrible shame, all this. An absolute disaster. I never wish to see us lose challengers for this sort of reason. Yet we do what we must do to keep things fair and sportsmanlike.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, during one of Bede’s matches, I heard the announcer say that Bede has no family. Apparently it was Rose who took Bede under his wing, and so Bede was battling for the chairman’s sake.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What an awful turn of events... I hope the mural survived all that.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Not a brilliant turn of events, but the ruins were brought into the light for us to see...[VAR 0114(000B)]
What does this tell us about Galar’s legends?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pokémon?
A sword and shield?
Right! More than any hero, there’s those things that appear to be Pokémon that stand out! Not just that, but those Pokémon appear to be holding a sword and shield as if they were using them![VAR 0114(000B)]
Anything else look interesting to you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The hero...was actually two people?
The same as the tapestries?
Oh, good observation! There really were two heroes. But if that’s the case, then why only the one statue at the Budew Drop Inn?[VAR 0114(000B)]
More than any statue of a hero or old tapestry, these ruins made in truly ancient times must show us the real truth.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Which means...[VAR 0114(000B)]
The sword is a Pokémon!
The shield is a Pokémon!
Yup! I was thinking the same thing! Seems like at some point in history the sword and shield were combined with the two actual Pokémon and treated as the same thing... But then what? They just faded from history?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Two young heroes... The sword and shield were actually Pokémon... But why would the truth of these ruins be hidden when their stories were depicted in artwork?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With your help, I really feel like we made a big discovery here. Thanks! I’ll give you a couple of these, so you keep giving it your best in the Gym Challenge, too, OK? Guess you’ll be headed to Ballonlea next, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So... There was history being covered up by all that over-stylized artwork... I’m gonna have to look into this some more.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Gym Challenger. Would you like to challenge our Gym?
Of course!
Hold on...
Then please change into your uniform in the locker room. This will not be a mission so much as a test of your quality. It is a very serious examination.
That uniform looks good on you. Now relax, clear your mind, and go break a leg.
Goodness... That is a shame. How quick you were to give up.
I hope you enjoy the little examination we call our Gym’s mission.
You received a TM from Leader Opal, yes? The next Gym waits for you in Circhester.
The Fairy Badge suits you. Keep up the fine work, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].

Ah, there you are, my dear Gym Challenger. Though you are really lacking in the color pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
See, I’m looking for a successor to take on the role of Gym Leader here. So my Gym mission serves as an audition of sorts, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, don’t worry. It’s simple enough. All you need to do is battle my Trainers and answer the questions they ask along the way.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Think carefully before answering, though, child. If you get the wrong answer, the stats of your Pokémon will get lowered. Oh, but if you answer correctly, your Pokémon will get a stat boost. Just think of it as a little Fairy-type Pokémon magic to make things interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, I want you to go all out. Show me what you can do![VAR 0114(0013)]

Now, let the Gym mission begin! Battle with all your skill!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Try to achieve victory while answering the questions given by the Gym Trainers!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
In that case, good luck!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Gym mission! Now, I wonder if you’ve met the standards of the Gym Leader. Would you like to immediately challenge the Gym Leader, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?
I’m good to go!
I need some time
Right! Then head on in! Give my regards to the Gym Leader!
Of course. You probably need to save a record of your progress and whatnot.
All right, OK. It’s time to start your audition to see if you’re worthy of becoming the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
I see... I can’t say what Ms. Opal will think, but you’ve at least piqued my interest.
I’m the second Trainer. Don’t worry about the last question. Let’s keep moving forward.
Don’t worry about right or wrong. Just keep moving forward.
I’m next. I think you might have what it takes to become the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
We should be focusing on the Gym Challenge, but Ms. Opal insisted on making this an audition.

I suppose it’s a bit late to introduce myself, but... I’m Opal, the Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve gotten a good look at how you handled those quizzes.[VAR 0114(0013)]

I’ve gotten a good look at how you handled those quizzes.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The last part of the mission is me... Let me have a look at how you and your partner Pokémon behave![VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, good try.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Not bad, not bad at all. Still, not what I’m looking for... Oh, don’t worry yourself about it, child. It’s just a matter of my preference.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll find the next Gym Leader elsewhere. In fact, I’ve already got an idea about where to look.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Too bad about the audition, but here’s a Fairy Badge for your efforts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 45!
Take this TM with you, too. A little bonus from this old lady.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Lastly, here’s a little something for humoring me. This might help add a little more pink to you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Of course it’s not good to neglect your elders, but old folk like me should also know when it’s time to step out of the spotlight.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There were a total of six questions! Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], you got... [VAR 0200(0001)] of them correct.
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

Hold on now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve got a few errands to run in Hammerlocke. Care to join me for the journey? If you’re headed for the next Gym Stadium, you’ll need to get to Hammerlocke, too, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
With pleasure!
I’ll find my own way
They say two’s company, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I like that attitude, child. Still, you’re in the middle of the Gym Challenge, are you not? You’ll need to head back to Hammerlocke either way if you want to get to Circhester.[VAR 0114(0013)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1160

Hammerlocke—always such a dusty town. Though I suppose some Pokémon prefer it that way.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Didn’t we just part ways? I certainly seem to run into you a lot.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hm? That boy...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that’s what I would call pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Come to gawk at me now that I’ve had my Challenge Band taken away and my Gym Challenger status revoked? Can you really afford to waste time like this?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course!
Not really...
Well, I suppose so. You no longer have to worry about catching up with me, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I commend your humility. It is appropriate for a Trainer of your...limited talents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll have you know, though, that I haven’t given up! I must become the Champion in order to help out the chairman! I will go and ask him to let me rejoin the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
So sincere and straightforward and yet so twisted and misguided... I like it! That’s the kind of thing that gives people some depth![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, listen. I’ll let you attempt my Gym mission, even if you’re not a Gym Challenger. In fact, I don’t plan on giving you a choice, so don’t even think about refusing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Time for my Gym mission, child![VAR 0114(0013)]
Huh? Wha—?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
And pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Congratulations, child![VAR 0114(0013)]
You are most definitely pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
M-Ms. Opal? What in the world has gotten into you?![VAR 0114(000C)]
You were used by Oleana—am I right? You worked hard to gather Wishing Stars for her, only to have her throw you away like rubbish once she was done with you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come with me, child. I might be able to help you out. Of course, it all depends on how much hard work you’re willing to put in, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Are you... Are you testing me? Very well, I accept! In fact, I plan on making sure you see my full talents and tell me everything you know about the Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000C)]
Farewell for now, child. You should head to Circhester. I take it you know how to get to Route 7.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Huh? A Power Spot?![VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s wrong?
You mean, like where you can Dynamax?
I’m getting readings from the Power Spot Detector... Does that mean Dynamaxing is possible here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! The Power Spot Detector reacts when it’s possible to Dynamax![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, Sonia! And [VAR 0100(0000)], too! You felt the shaking, right? Seems Chairman Rose is testing something again.[VAR 0114(0004)]

You’ll just get lost, Leon. I’m going, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m really looking forward to seeing you compete in the Finals. So you should leave the investigation on the quaking to the adults. Head to Circhester and get that Gym Badge![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
First that forest, then that mad quiz... I’ve been lost in every sense of the word! But it looks like I’ve finally caught up to you again.[VAR 0114(0005)]

All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and I both know I’ve got to keep on trying different strategies if I’m gonna get strong enough to catch up to Lee... No! Not just catch up! If I want to surpass him![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I think you know what’s coming, mate... Let me try out my latest in a battle against you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Before we ever started out on this journey... I remember watching Lee on the telly. He was like a bright star, so strong I could hardly bear to look right at him.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But now, I can tell just how strong he really is... And what he’s got that I haven’t...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m getting stronger, too. Maybe not as fast as you, but fine. Whatever! Thanks for letting me battle with you again. And here. I’ll heal up your team for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I know what it is I really want... I want to battle Lee—I want to take on my bro. But not just that, I want to beat him! I want to be the one who beats the unbeatable Champion! And I’m going to![VAR 0114(0005)]
My mind’s made up! You and me are going to have another battle once I get my Gym Badge in Circhester![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome, Gym Challenger. Do you want to attempt the Gym mission?
Of course!
Let me think
If you want to attempt the mission, then you’ll need to change into your uniform. The dressing room’s that way.
Make sure to receive the Trap Detector up ahead, too. You’ll need it for the Gym mission.
There may be some things you can’t overcome without pushing yourself at least a little.
You’re here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite sayings is “determination will move mountains”!

I’m good...
Then allow me to explain a little about the Trap Detector you hold in your hands!
The reason you’ll need it is simple. There are invisible pitfalls everywhere in here!
If you fall into one, you’ll have to start again from the last platform you reached. The detector will vibrate when there’s a pitfall in front of you. The closer the hole, the stronger the vibration!
Then on with you! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Try to reach the goal without falling into any of the invisible pitfalls!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission! So what do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Would you like to face the Gym Leader at once?

Very well! Move on ahead, and show that Gym Leader what you can do!
Of course. You no doubt have to prepare and save a record of what you’ve done. I understand!

I am Melony. As you can clearly see, I’ve assembled a team of all Ice-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, fancy that! You made it all the way to me without falling in a hole. If I’m not careful, you could sweep my feet right out from under me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You! You aren’t sore all over from falling in a hole or two, are you? Even if you are, I’m not going to hold back![VAR 0114(0015)]
All righty, I suppose we should get started. You won’t be able to escape when I freeze you solid. And after that... Well, you’ll see. I think you’ll find my battle style is quite severe.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You... You’re pretty good, huh? Of course seeing my Pokémon lose is sad, but to meet someone so young with such ability is quite grand.[VAR 0114(0015)]

You think so? I guess it could be that they were sealed away. Or maybe they’ve gone into some kind of sleep?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Based on those statues we saw back in Stow-on-Side, the sword and the shield were actually two Pokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right! That’s my take on it, at least.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember the Pokémon we met that day? Do you think...it could’ve been one of them? Either the sword or the shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You...met them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on! You know what I’m talking about, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
In the Slumbering Weald?
I really don’t
Exactly! The mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog! Don’t you think that could’ve been it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Not so sharp when it’s not about battle, huh? Don’t you remember that mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog that day? Don’t you think that could’ve been it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, that’s right! You lot have been in the Slumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I only started on this journey because my gran told me to, but this is turning out to be too much fun! You’ve got to tell me more. How about we discuss this over a meal? Go on, what do you want to eat? Let’s get our orders in![VAR 0114(000B)]
Fascinating... All right, the next thing to do now that we’re done eating is to have a look around Circhester! Let’s inspect the Hero’s Bath![VAR 0114(000B)]

The Hero’s Bath... They say this is where the two heroes came to soothe their wounds after the battle to bring down that evil presence, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Nowadays only Pokémon really use the Hero’s Bath, though... Hmm... Who exactly were the heroes that bathed here? I think I’ll have to look into that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two met a mysterious Pokémon back in the Slumbering Weald... Perhaps...you two can become new heroes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and shield? Pull the other one. Though...I guess I’d fancy a shield, if I had to take my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and shield? Pull the other one. Though...I guess I’d fancy a sword, if I had to take my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What kind of battle do you think the heroes had back then?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why don’t we show her, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Think we can pull off a real heroic battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Give me a minute...
I’ve been getting stronger and stronger lately! I won’t lose to Lee, some hero, or even you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Come and have a go![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I get it. Prepare as much as you like![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia treated us to a great meal. After that curry, I feel like I’ve got the energy to wrestle a Bewear![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t entirely understand your reasoning, but I might just as well see what you can do. I’ll heal up your Pokémon for you, [VAR 0100(0000)], so give it your best![VAR 0114(000B)]
Time for a little exhibition match, starring the future Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks! You two gave a right proper battle... At the rate you both are going, even the unbeatable Leon may be in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
So what’s next, you two? I plan to look into things in the Slumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m going to keep challenging that Gym! Then, once I get that Gym Badge, I’ll be heading for Route 9 to take on Spikemuth next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems like he finally shook off that gloom. Leon’d worry if Hop wasn’t feeling all right. As his rival, you wouldn’t like it either, right? See ya.[VAR 0114(000B)]

There’s no way we’re lettin’ you anywhere near Spikemuth! And that means we can’t let you go on to Route 9![VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s Team Yell’s duty to cheer on these lovely Drednaw! And we also get to stop people from headin’ out over the water![VAR 0114(0044)]
Ba bite!
Yes, I understand... All I’m saying is that I can make it so that Rotom Bikes can ride on water...
Why, we meet again, my young Gym Challenger friend! Remember me? I gave you that bike! So, do you think you could do me another favor and teach these ruffians a lesson or two?
It’s our duty to protect Drednaw! And that means yer gonna need to give up on the Gym Challenge! You look like you need convincin’, so how about a Pokémon battle?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Then clear off, would ya? We’re busy cheerin’ on Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll send you packin’! For the sake of Drednaw, of course.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Even if you reach Spikemuth, it’s not like you’re gonna be able to do the Gym Challenge. Why not just give up now?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Gah! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s gonna ride the Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oi! I’ve got an idea! We can get on Drednaw first and ride it away![VAR 0114(0044)]
All right! Get a move on, Drednaw! See ya later, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ba bite!
Seems you’ve come to my aid yet again. How’s the cycling life been treating you? Are you having fun?
Wouldn’t it be great if you could ride your Rotom Bike on the water, too?
That’s why I’m going to add these special parts, allowing it to travel along the water’s surface...just for you!
All right, all right! With the Rotom Bike “Water Mode,” you’ll cruise across the water like a Pokémon with Swift Swim! By the by, when you’re riding on land, we’ll call it “Land Mode.”

I can’t enter Spikemuth, so I’ve just been hanging around here this whole time...
No one can challenge the Dark-type Leader like this...
What’s with the gate being shut? How am I supposed to get the Gym Badge now?!
Even a run-down place like this is important for the people and Pokémon who live here.

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
I was born ’ere so I know another way in.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you wanna get into the town, how ’bout I show you the way? But...you’re my rival. So you’ll have to beat me in a battle first, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
With pleasure!
Let me think about it
Oh, did I misjudge you...? Ahhh, I get it. You need to get ready! Go on, then! I’ll wait here until you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’ve had a pretty good win streak in the Gym Challenge, just like me! I respect you as my rival and all that, but I got too much at stake to go around losin’ now![VAR 0114(000D)]
My partner Morpeko has been interested in you and your strength, and I think I get it now. But I’ve got everyone in Spikemuth supportin’ me![VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m definitely gonna get all eight Gym Badges just so I can have a rematch with you. Don’cha forget it! I’ll get my revenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(000D)]
Anyway, I promised I’d show you a way in, so follow me![VAR 0114(000D)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1330

With the shutter closed, nobody’s gonna be able to challenge the Gym... I gotta look into this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I just happened to have too many of these, so I’ll give you one, got it? You can handle yourself, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Oi! Welcome to Spikemuth, kid! Hope yer ready for the Gym mission![VAR 0114(0045)]
’Old on, mate. If you’re gonna take on the Gym mission, you’d better change into yer uniform![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Gym Leader, he’s straight ahead from here![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you head back, you’ll be retirin’. Do you wanna retire?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Step past there, and you’ll be givin’ up![VAR 0114(0045)]
Only one healthy Pokémon? You thinkin’ about turnin’ tail and yelleavin’?[VAR 0114(0045)]
You seriously beat Piers? Here—a TM to remember this moment![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hey! There’s some trouble over on Route 9! It’s so bad, even the Champion’s come to sort things out! Oh, hey! You gave Piers a thrashing, didn’t you? You should head over there to help. C’mon, then! I’ll show you the way.
Me? I’m just here as a part-time job. I’m fi-yellin’ in for the proper League staff.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The Gym Leader’s waitin’ for you! Go right on ahead if you want to get trounced![VAR 0114(0045)]
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
Gym Challenger. You wanna get past me, but I don’t want that. Basically, it’s a battle between our desires.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I don’t wanna let you through! That’s why I was waitin’ all squeezed in this crack. But since I lost, it was really all for nothin’! Whatever. You won, so I guess I’ll step aside.[VAR 0114(0045)]
D’you know the Pokémon move Light Screen?[VAR 0114(0045)]
What’s this? A Gym Challenger made it through? All us Team Yell members have blocked the way. Don’t think we’ll just let you waltz through![VAR 0114(0045)]
That was...totally unbelievable. Even my Pokémon are in awe of you and your team. Here, go on through. Check out our neon signs while you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Mr. Mime is a dancin’ Pokémon... It makes for a cheery member of our team.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’m yellin’ for no reason![VAR 0114(0045)]
Did I surprise you? I’m a little surprised how much my legs hurt from that landin’! If I stand still like this for too long, it’ll hurt so bad I might cry... So I’ll shake it off with a battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
Well, it’s true that I lost, but I pushed through the pain, so you should praise me for that! All right! Now that the pain’s gone, I guess I’d better get outta here.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The HP of your Pokémon not lookin’ so good?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I practiced that back handspring so much, even a pop star would be jealous of those moves. Were you surprised? Oi, be surprised, you! While you’re in utter shock, I’m gonna sneakily win this battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
I shoulda been practicin’ my battle skills, not my backflip skills... Thanks for showin’ me that. Guess I’ll cheer for you from now on.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Team Yell takes the field! This might be the Gym Challenge, but I won’t let you ruin our cool secret hangout![VAR 0114(0045)]
What?! You only got one healthy Pokémon? Oi, don’t come back unless you got a Revive or somethin’—got it?[VAR 0114(0045)]
All right, time for a pincer attack! We’ll do whatever it takes to win![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah! I didn’t have enough time to get my disguise ready! That’s right! Team Yell is actually made up of Spikemuth Gym Trainers!
Ugh, whatever! Our Gym Leader’s up next, but he’s really strong. Got that?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I mean, everybody already knew the true identity of Team Yell, right? That means I won’t get in trouble for not gettin’ my disguise on, right? I sure hope so...
Bari bari!
There’s some kind of invisible wall! You can’t get through, no matter how you try!

Shut your gob![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Uh... I’m really sorry! The lot from Spikemuth’s tellin’ me they locked down the city for my sake...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Spikemuth just keeps gettin’ worse and worse. And all Piers says is “Don’t worry”...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So... So we decided to disguise ourselves as Team Yell and sabotage the other challengers.[VAR 0114(0044)]
We thought, if we could stop the other Gym Challengers from reachin’ the Gym, then Ms. Marnie would be the only one to win and make it to the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0043)]
And we figured that’d increase the chances of our wonderful Ms. Marnie becomin’ the new Champion![VAR 0114(0044)]
*sigh* That’s no way to help someone at all![VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], no need to bother with all the preparations, or whatever. Go on in and face the Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh man, Ms. Marnie’s scoldings go on forever... I remember once she scolded her Morpeko for so long, it practically fell asleep...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I can hear Piers just rockin’ away. His Pokémon chorus sounds pretty great, too.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m gonna be givin’ Piers my best yells durin’ his battle with you![VAR 0114(005E)]

*sigh*... So you’re finally here, huh?[VAR 0114(0042)]
See, I’m...I’m really not a great Gym Leader. Figured that’s why nobody was comin’ to challenge me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I have good ears, so I overheard the whole thing about the city bein’ shut up. When I was alone, it was like my soul was weepin’.[VAR 0114(0042)]
This is a simple Gym Stadium. We can’t even Dynamax our Pokémon, but well... I still hope you enjoy the battle.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m the Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, the Dark-type user![VAR 0114(0016)]
You wanna challenge me, even though you know you’ll lose? Then this song’s for you, foolish Trainer![VAR 0114(0016)]
Get ready for a mosh pit with me and my party! Spikemuth, it’s time to rock![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m glad we were able to battle. Seems like my Pokémon feel the same way.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Here’s your Dark Badge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 55!
Here’s a uniform, too... I’ve actually been thinkin’ about just sellin’ them at my concerts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
My little sis Marnie’s gonna challenge me next, I bet.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I was watchin’ YOUR battle, Bro. It’s how I learned to battle an’ all that.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That right? That reminds me. Marnie, there’s somethin’ I wanted to tell you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I want you to take over the Gym here in Spikemuth as its Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeah, I know. You’d planned to retire after the Champion Cup, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I think you’ve really become a great Gym Leader, even if you don’t Dynamax your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I love you, but my answer is a big, fat “NO”![VAR 0114(000D)]
I mean, when I end up becomin’ Champion, I won’t be able to be a Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Good point. In that case, let your big bro see if you have the skill to be a Champion![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)], thanks for havin’ an amazin’ Pokémon battle with my brother. It’s my turn next! So clear off for a bit, ’K?[VAR 0114(000D)]

I already told you, didn’t I? Keep your eye on the goal! And for you, that’s winning the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
The only Gym Badge left is the one you’ll get from the Dragon Gym’s Leader, Raihan. Right? Raihan is the only Trainer out there I consider a real rival. He’s that good, you know![VAR 0114(0004)]
And there I go again! Sorry, but I suppose this is no time for me to be stopping for a chat. There’s a bit of trouble here with my name on it. But don’t you worry about a thing![VAR 0114(0004)]
The unbeatable Champion is here to look after things and keep you all safe![VAR 0114(0004)]

What was that loud noise?
That’s what I’d like to know! That noise—it was like some massive explosion! There was this huge surge of red light, and then wild Pokémon just started Dynamaxing around me, brazen as you like![VAR 0114(0005)]
Take a look at the news![VAR 0114(0005)]
See! There’s Lee! He really is the greatest, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Lee and his Charizard took down that Dynamax Pokémon in the blink of an eye![VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew Lee was strong, but this! Really makes you appreciate how great he is, eh? Let’s go meet up with him, [VAR 0100(0000)]! He should be at Hammerlocke Stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]

Well, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d expect nothing less from you and your Charizard, Leon! You took down that Dynamax Pokémon in no time at all![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, I am the unbeatable Champion, after all! But what all is going on here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
An overflowing red light... Pokémon Dynamaxing without a Power Spot?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, but why?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m not sure... What’s going on? That red light could suddenly appear again at any time and we’d have no way of knowing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But being able to predict such things is part of a scientist’s work.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Gran?![VAR 0114(000B)]
The chairman called for me. He wanted to know all about the red light’s relationship to the Dynamax phenomenon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Did the chairman know anything?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Nothing worth my time. The chairman’s all wrapped up in fretting over the future of our energy, apparently. He’s left everything to that executive lady. We just don’t have enough data.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s why I wanted to ask you to start looking into things, too, Sonia. You know more than anyone about the Darkest Day, after all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you saying that red light and the Darkest Day are connected?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, do you reckon there’s anything we could do to help out?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There must be!
Yeah, we’ll help!
Thanks! I appreciate the thought. But all I could ever ask of you would be that you join me in the greatest final match ever. I’ll do my part to make that happen by keeping everybody’s future safe. So you just keep on doing your part by winning your way through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right. Course! You’re the unbeatable Champion, after all, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gran, there’s something I want to look into. You’ll help me, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naturally.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like we all know what we need to do. So, you two—clear the Gym Challenge so we can meet again at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0004)]
I know what I need to do, all right— defeat that Piers once and for all! You’re off to Hammerlocke Stadium, yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Raihan’s a tough nut to crack![VAR 0114(0005)]

The long Gym Challenge is nearing its end, I see. Are you ready to face Hammerlocke Gym and its leader, the dragon user Raihan?
You bet I am!
Maybe another time...
You must remember that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she who dares, wins.
In that case, please use the changing room to change into your uniform.
That uniform you wear is a symbol of all of your victories. I feel your determination. Now, head to where all the Gym Trainers await... No, not the stadium, but the vault!
Ah, one moment! You need at least two battle-ready Pokémon to face Raihan!
The Gym mission, right? Together with your partner, you can’t lose!
That uniform fits you to a tee! Head on in, number [VAR 01C4(0001)]!
Hold on there! If you want to face Raihan, you first need to gather seven Gym Badges. Only then will Raihan even think about letting you face him!

Let’s see, how many Gym Challengers are left? Huh... Not even ten, eh?[VAR 0114(0017)]
All right then. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Time to explain the great Raihan’s Gym mission![VAR 0114(0017)]
The rules are simple! All you’ve got to do is defeat three Gym Trainers that I personally trained—in Double Battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
The Gym Challenge is meant to be, well... challenging, wouldn’t you say? Naturally there aren’t too many Gym Challengers who can make it this far.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And that’s why I provide a format where you can really show off the brilliant combinations you and your Pokémon should be capable of![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s probably more than enough out of me. Time for someone else to take the spotlight! Come on, Sebastian! You’ll be first![VAR 0114(0017)]
Yeah, that’s me. Sebastian. Leader Raihan has taught me two things! First, that Dragon types are ferociously powerful! Second, I need to create an advantage on the battlefield to fully utilize that power!
I can see why you’ve managed to make it this far!
In Double Battles, it’s important to figure out what role each of your opponent’s Pokémon play.
It looks like you don’t have two Pokémon that can battle.
Fantastic! I can see those seven Badges you have were well-earned!
A Double Battle... Do you combine the strength of two Pokémon to push through, or do you have one of them support the other? Let me see what your strategy is!
The Gym mission here requires you to participate in Double Battles. You need to have at least two Pokémon ready for battle...
Well done! I am honored to have battled against such a talented Trainer.
If you manage to beat the Trainer who was beside me, you’ll face me next.
Something the matter, [VAR 0100(0000)]? You’re not done with my Gym mission yet.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Never mind
I want to withdraw
[~ 18]
Hah! Then hurry up and get it over with! I want to battle you already![VAR 0114(0017)]
Are you sure you want to withdraw?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Fair enough. But you’re not the type to simply give up, right? I’ll be waiting for you to come back soon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve completed my Gym mission! Come on. Time to head to the Gym Stadium. You’ve earned the right to face me yourself![VAR 0114(0017)]
Time to face the second Trainer! Come on, Camilla![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve made it to the third and last Trainer! Your moment to shine, Aria![VAR 0114(0017)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1430
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, a challenger made it! I’ve been waiting for someone to battle... Though I’ve got to admit I didn’t think it’d be you![VAR 0114(0017)]
But I guess I should’ve expected no less from a Pokémon Trainer that Leon saw promise in.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you aim to defeat Leon... Do you have any idea just how high a hurdle that is? As his greatest rival, I guess that I—Raihan—will have to show you![VAR 0114(0017)]
Gym Leader Raihan doesn’t simply control the weather. He also seeks two-on-two battles! You must be prepared for any situation against a foe like him![VAR 0114(0017)]
In the aftermath of the furious battle... I feel as pure and refreshed as when the sky clears after a storm.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What can I possibly say? Calling myself Leon’s rival? Seems I’d grown quite conceited for someone who can’t even claim the title of Champion! Overconfident in both myself and my team![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll give you what you want, then. The proof of your victory—the Dragon Badge![VAR 0114(0017)]
You can now catch Pokémon of any level!
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges from the Galar region![VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, win your way through the Semifinals and Finals for your chance to challenge Leon! You must! You owe us that much at least, for beating us in battle here today![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges... At last it’s time for the Champion Cup! I look forward to seeing how you all do in battle!
Please accept my congratulations on making it through the Gym Challenge!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

Hey! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
Sorry to hold you up, but there was something I forgot.[VAR 0114(0017)]
First off, as a sign of my respect... Here. TM99. It contains the move Breaking Swipe.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And secondly...here’s the Dragon-type Gym uniform, the mark of true strength![VAR 0114(0017)]
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve completed the Gym Challenge! Good on you, kid. Now, prove your strength to the whole region at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0017)]
Raihan! I’m here to see just how good you are![VAR 0114(0005)]
There you are, Leon’s little brother! Don’t worry—I’ll give you a battle that’ll make you want to quit the Gym Challenge altogether![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve tried out lots of different strategies, and I’ve made up my mind about how I want to battle. I’m not gonna lose! I’m gonna beat you, and [VAR 0100(0000)], and even Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be seeing you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s have another epic battle someday! If you’re feeling up to it, you might want to go train hard in the Wild Area![VAR 0114(0017)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1440
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You gave Raihan a good thrashing, and that means you’ve completed the Gym Challenge! Congratulations, from the bottom of my heart![VAR 0114(000B)]
I really wish we could go celebrate, but I think there’re some things we should talk over.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That light that covered Hammerlocke... It was just like the Darkest Day, where it’s said that giant Pokémon went on a rampage and almost destroyed the entire Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It certainly seems to be that way, my dear. As you know, we Dynamax our Pokémon today using the energy from Wishing Stars that have fallen to us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But we still don’t know how to fully control the energy behind Dynamaxing or how the two heroes managed to do so. In fact, we’re not even really sure who—or what— the two heroes actually were.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The legendary sword and shield...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia, my dearest... My lab coat is yours now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you sure, Gran? I still haven’t finished the work you’ve assigned me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Think of this as something to help you finish that work.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Sonia!
It looks great!
Y-yeah![VAR 0114(000B)]
The two heroes that protected the Galar region from the Darkest Day... And the legend of the sword and shield you just mentioned... It’s up to you to figure out the truth behind it all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I know, Gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll do what I can! You or Hop could be the one to take down Leon, and I don’t want to miss that! Not to worry—you can count on me to take care of everything! You just focus on getting to Wyndon. Go on! Head to the station, or you’ll miss your train![VAR 0114(000B)]
The station’s near Route 7, remember? Now, off with you, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]
There are things that only young people like you can do, and there are other things that should be left to the adults. Everyone has their own role.[VAR 0114(000A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1450
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wait up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m coming, too! I had Raihan beat in no time! Once I got my head on straight and stopped doubting every decision I made, that is... Heh![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you never stopped nattering on through the entire battle... You’re pretty different from the Champion in that![VAR 0114(0017)]
But your strength is genuine, as proven by the Dragon Badge you won from me. You came at me with all the force of a raging storm, and even I was blown away![VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, you two! Battle your way through the Champion Cup tournament to face Leon! One of you ought to![VAR 0114(0017)]
I reckon I’m still the favorite to win, but I’m up against my true rival, [VAR 0100(0000)]... So I’ll wring out every last thing I learned during my battle with you, Raihan, to beat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0005)]
So get a move on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! The train’s waiting![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1460
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So this is Route 10! It’s like a wall made out of snow![VAR 0114(0005)]
Bet there’ll be Ice-type Pokémon crawling out of the woodwork in a place like this![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Reckon we’ll be able to train ourselves up to new heights here, before the Champion Cup starts?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe in myself and the Pokémon on my team, and I know we’ll all get loads stronger![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I’m off! See you in Wyndon, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]

All right! Wyndon City! This is the place where I become a legend at last![VAR 0114(0005)]
You get it, don’t you, mate? After all, I’m about to become the new Champion of the Galar region![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s it! I’m headed straight for Wyndon Stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t waste too much time, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You should head there yourself![VAR 0114(0005)]

Text File : main_event_1490
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the reception desk![VAR 0114(0005)]
Turns out I was the first to register for the Champion Cup. In other words, I’m already number one. It’s pretty much in the bag that I’ll win this thing![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], correct? We’ve been watching over your performance in the Gym Challenge. This is just a formality, of course, but I’ll need to check your Gym Badges, if you don’t mind.
[~ 3]

I’m all sorted and ready to battle you on the biggest stage of them all![VAR 0114(0005)]

But it looks like Bede couldn’t make it. Hard luck... Somehow I didn’t think he’d just take being disqualified lying down, you know what I mean?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess it is what it is... Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. We should head to the locker room![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it. I really made it. I made it through the Gym Challenge. There might be four remainin’ in the Semifinals... But I’m the one who’s gonna win through and battle the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara!

Attention, Gym Challengers who have made it through the Gym Challenge. The Semifinals will be starting soon! Please head to the stadium pitch when you are ready.
This is it. I really made it. I made it through the Gym Challenge. There might be four remainin’ in the Semifinals... But I’m the one who’s gonna win through and battle the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]

You sleep well, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
My heart just wouldn’t stop racing somehow, and I couldn’t sleep a wink. I spent the whole night practicing my ball throw...[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s it! I’m heading to the stadium! The Flying Taxis out front of the hotel can take you straight to it, so I’ll see you there, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1510
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We’ve been expecting you, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]. As the Champion Cup is about to begin, allow me to explain how it works... First, there are the Semifinals, where you will face the other Trainers who completed the Gym Challenge. If you manage to win in the Semifinals, you will then face the top seven Gym Leaders of the Galar region in the Finals. Defeat them, and you will finally be able to face the Champion in the Championship Match.
The matches will begin shortly. Please ready yourself and head to the pitch.
[~ 2]
[~ 3]
Your first opponent is already waiting for you on the pitch.
You again, eh? Well, best of luck to you, kid. Not that it’ll do you a lick of good. Marnie’s sure to win this thing.[VAR 0114(0043)]
As members of Team Yell, we’ll be cheerin’ for our Marnie.[VAR 0114(0044)]

Heh. I knew you’d get all the Badges and meet me here.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I know that there’s been a lot between us, what with my big brother, Team Yell, helpin’ Spikemuth and all that...[VAR 0114(000D)]
But the truth is, when all’s said and done... I really just wanna become Champion for myself![VAR 0114(000D)]
So don’t take it personal when I kick your butt![VAR 0114(000D)]
Everyone in the stadium was watchin’ us durin’ all that... I heard them cheerin’ for me and my Pokémon. It was nice...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I may have lost, but... At least we drove the audience wild! Guess that’s not so bad![VAR 0114(000D)]
Think I’ll join my brother in the stands, and we’ll watch from the sidelines to see who ends up challengin’ the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just so y’know... I still haven’t decided if I’m gonna cheer for you... See ya![VAR 0114(000D)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be waiting for you in the final match![VAR 0114(0005)]
After seeing the way you battled, I can’t accept any outcome besides winning this match! My team is on fire![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pardon me...
I know you didn’t get a long break, but the match before yours ended more quickly than expected...
Challenger Hop won quite handily, so as soon as you’re ready, we’d like you back on the pitch.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1540

I just had this sort of flashback, you know. Remember? Back when we were still in Postwick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
When we got our Pokémon from Lee that day, I never would’ve dreamed that I’d end up standing here...facing you, of all people.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s time I finish what was started that day... Got it? The one who’ll become Champion is me![VAR 0114(0005)]
And the victor of the Semifinals, the challenger who has won their way through all of the many hopeful Trainers in the Gym Challenge is... Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
You know, even when Sonia was saying that you and me looked like we could become heroes, I really never felt like one...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But you, mate! I think maybe you really could do all sorts of great things![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And [VAR 0101(0001)] and all the rest of your team![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! That was incredible. Brilliant. Honestly...there were even tears rolling down my face before I knew it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
To think that the two of you set out together from the same town, built up the greatest teams, and arrived here at this point to throw everything you had at one another...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That burning desire to win... Those moves filled with undefeatable passion! It was battling at its very purest, in every possible way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even though there were some Trainers who weren’t sure whether you were fit to be endorsed for the Gym Challenge at first...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That was you, Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well then, all the more reason! My team members and I will give everything that we’ve got in us to defeat our challenger.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And the challenger standing before us might well end up being you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. In fact, that’s precisely what I’m hoping for![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]! The real challenge is what’s coming next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m completely exhausted! I just want to head back to the hotel and rest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Best to refill your energy stores first! Why don’t we go get some dinner together?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I wouldn’t say no, but... you never care at all what food tastes like, Lee! A night like this deserves more than rubbish takeaway, so at least pick something good![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1560
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! Hey, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Got some time for questions?!
First question! You and Challenger Hop were both endorsed by the Champion, making the two of you rivals in a sense, wouldn’t you say? How does it feel to have defeated your rival?
I’m glad I could beat him
It doesn’t quite feel real yet
It was just luck that I won
Right... Question number two! If you wanted to tell Challenger Hop something right now, what would it be?
I’d thank him for the great match!
I’d tell him how strong he was
That he was just the rival I knew he was
Question three! Level with me, kiddo. Your honest thoughts here. Think you can win the Finals, too?
I absolutely do
I’m not sure...
I doubt it, really...
All right—that’s enough! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s already tired from battle! And you’ve been asking rather rude questions![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got ourselves dinner plans with my brother, so, sorry, but clear off already, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, yes, I understand! Looking forward to seeing the birth of a new star!
Phew... Famous people sure have it rough, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope Lee gets here soon. I could eat my own arm about now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1570
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several hours later...
This is absurd... Even Lee’s never this late. Something’s not right.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He always does what he says he’ll do. As a kid, he promised me he’d become Champion one day, and he went and did just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
He ought to be able to keep to his own dinner plans![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kid’s sure got a mouth on him, huh? If you were that noisy durin’ battle, you’d unleash a whole new level of power, you know.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, pack it in, Piers! I’m seriously worried here! So I don’t need to see your smug mug looking like you’re having a go at me, even though you act like you’re giving me good advice![VAR 0114(0005)]
Judgin’ by appearances? No wonder you lost to your mate.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Champion, I saw him headin’ to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Why would he go there?
Rose Tower?
Dunno what he’s up to, but I ran into him at the monorail platform. He said to tell you that he had somethin’ to do at Rose Tower, so he’d be late to your dinner.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But why Rose Tower? What could he have to do there at this hour?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers, do us a favor. Take us to Rose Tower, would you? Neither [VAR 0100(0000)] nor I know the way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sheesh... What rude siblings, always so demandin’ of others.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Though I s’ppose... It’s a real problem for me, too, if the Finals are held up for any reason. And I don’t really hate the two of you little runts. You were good enough to beat me, after all.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So I think I’ll invite Team Yell along, and we’ll all have ourselves a bit of fun. Shall we?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Brilliant! You’re the best, Piers! Let’s go make a real ruckus![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1580
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Man, why am I here for this? I’m totally exhausted from that battle with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000D)]
We decided that Team Yell will cheer you on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s help out together.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What a beautiful display of sibling love! However, it is entirely unnecessary.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Oleana?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Chairman Rose is with the Champion in a very, very important meeting...[VAR 0114(0007)]
There is no way I will let anyone interfere![VAR 0114(0007)]
After all, only authorized personnel with the proper key can ride the monorail to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That means as long as Chairman Rose is in the tower, no one can disturb him![VAR 0114(0007)]
I have hand selected a member of the League staff and given them a key. Chairman Rose does enjoy these kind of menial games after all.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can tell the difference between normal League staff and the one I chose?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can find me?
What should we do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Tch. This isn’t good! But I got this one![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Team Yell’s yellin’ will handle this![VAR 0114(0016)]
No. This is brilliant! I’ll search around the front of the stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
For now, we should try to head to the plaza together, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, let’s all work together and head for Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hmm. You should be able to get to the plaza yourself, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1585
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let’s find Oleana’s League staff member. That bad one was wearin’ those lame shades, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That bad League staff member was wearin’ some awful shades. And the key to findin’ anyone is to just ask everyone you meet![VAR 0114(0016)]
Seems like nobody’s seen that bad League staff member anywhere else. I bet they’re hidin’ somewhere nearby.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Makes sense for a cornered person to seek out the tightest hidin’ place, I guess. Don’t s’ppose you got a box lyin’ around?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Guess that wraps up Oleana’s little game. Course, I’m not one to talk, I guess. Team Yell did their fair share of lame tricks... Anyway, let’s head to the station.[VAR 0114(0016)]
... ... ...
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! This bloke’s awfully shifty, but I can’t get him to turn around! Say somethin’ surprisin’ so that he’ll have no choice but to look this way!
Ms. Oleana’s here!
We already have the key, you know
What?!
Blast, I turned around! And I can’t escape?! In that case, time for a Pokémon battle!
All I need to do is hide, and I won’t have to give you the key!
It’s a wonder how fast that guy could run... I’ve got no idea where he went, guv.
How’d you find me...? Or did you just talk to everyone you met?! Bah, whatever! I’ll defeat you this time!
They say hide a tree in a forest, so... I thought I could hide myself in the crowd!
You’re way too observant! But I’ll win this time and make my getaway!
Seems like you’ve got me cornered... But I’m not going to give up! An earful from Ms. Oleana is way worse than anything you lot can do! Good luck catching me on the monorail!
Team Yell, go find Hop! We’ll corner that League staff member at the station together![VAR 0114(0016)]
You did a crackin’ job of cornerin’ that bad League staff member, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let me sing you a song fittin’ of your rockin’ deeds![VAR 0114(0016)]
The only thing a humble singer can do is sing a humble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe I can’t cheer someone on just with the tunes I play. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe my songs don’t make anyone happy. Maybe I can’t help. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still the only thing I can do is sing—sing my humble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Piers!
Go Pieeerrrs!
Hey, isn’t that Piers? Why’s he doing a street performance?
I think you mean a station performance. Come on—let’s see if we can get closer!
We got the key, Piers! We can take the monorail to Rose Tower now!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop! Now’s your chance! Go! Get outta here![VAR 0114(0016)]

So this is Rose Tower! Just how tall do you think it is? I can’t even see the top, up there in the clouds.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So what should we do? Team Yell is gonna have their hands full holdin’ up those bad League staff members. They won’t be catchin’ up anytime soon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]. What should we do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go ahead!
Wait for the others to catch up?
Good thinking! Let’s go collect Lee and get out of here! Without him, there’s no Champion for you to challenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0005)]
’Fraid I can’t agree to that, mate. Team Yell’s giving it their all to help us out so we can go ahead and help Lee.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you cleared the way to Rose Tower. Now all you gotta do is charge on ahead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
An employee’s an employee I guess... Seems that exec lady hid the monorail key to try and impress the chairman.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Chairman Rose’s been keepin’ the Champion holed up inside. Wonder what he’s plottin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 10]
Times like this—when tension and passion run high—remind me of Spikemuth in the old days. Some right wild concerts we had back then. But no encores![VAR 0114(0016)]
Wait, you’re still here?[VAR 0114(0016)]
You better get goin’! I’ll send some support your way with a yell![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Whoa, it’s huge in here! What in the world is this place meant to be?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]... Don’t know if you knew this already, but I’ve heard Rose Tower was built on a Power Spot. Yeah, you know what I’m saying... When we get up to the roof and have a bit of space, we can Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Which is all well and good. But less certain is whether this lift can get us to the top...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower has, like, a hundred floors, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be leaving right now, so there’s no need to worry about the lift!
Intruder alert. Intruder alert. All staff are ordered to help remove the intruders from the premises at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See? If Ms. Oleana says so, then it looks like this is the end of the line for you kids.
If I get rid of the intruders, I’ll probably get a big bonus!
M-my bonus... My dream of finally affording a house of my own...
We need to speak with Chairman Rose! Tell us where he is![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get on the lift. The chairman’s at the top of the building.
All right! We’re nearly to Chairman Rose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Lee! We’re coming![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s crack on![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1610
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is taking ages...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What? I don’t think we’re at the roof yet... Why have we stopped?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are Gym Challengers, aren’t you? Thank you for taking part in the Galar League’s Gym Challenge! Yet I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to interfere in our work. We will drive you out to protect the many subsidiary companies housed here in Rose Tower!
Behold the gloriously high-tech elevators of Rose Tower, able to withstand Pokémon battles! They are constructed by the subsidiary Macro Cosmos Construction!
If I’ve been defeated, I have little choice but to respectfully retreat. Yet I must ask once more that you please do not interfere with Chairman Rose’s work.
The elevators in Rose Tower are constructed so that only the floor ascends. But that presents some danger, thus the presence of these walls constructed of light. You can thank Macro Cosmos Construction for providing this wonderful technology as well.
Wait... So the folks working in the tower can stop the elevator from the outside at any time? We’re just trying to get to the top already![VAR 0114(0005)]
Our teams have been working themselves ragged for us. Let me heal them all up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower is almost a thousand feet tall! You are now about five hundred feet above the ground!
I’m from MC Insurance! Do you have a life insurance policy?
I’m quite terrified of heights, actually...
Unfortunately, our insurance doesn’t pay out for being defeated in Pokémon battles...
You’re nearly to the top! But you’ll not be meeting the chairman!
I’ve got no fear of heights! I work high in the skies doing my job for the lofty Macro Cosmos Air!
Don’t you presume to meet the chairman! You’re not on the same level as such a great man!
You must know that in high-rises such as this one, the higher up you go, the more important the people you find working there. Chairman Rose is at the top of the top! Not just of this tower, but of all Galar!
Looks as though we’re nearly there, mate... Look sharp! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome to Chairman Rose’s exclusive space. Here, nearly a thousand feet above the earth![VAR 0114(0007)]
So, you got through all of the special staff that I had ordered to stop you. I would expect nothing less of the Trainers handpicked by Champion Leon himself.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But I am afraid it is now time for you to go home.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Because...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I will not allow anyone to disturb the great Chairman Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
You shall be the first, [VAR 0100(0000)]! If I beat you to pieces, then the Champion will have no one to battle and will thus lose heart. In that state, he will listen to anything the chairman says![VAR 0114(0007)]
Arghhh! This is inexcusable... What was I thinking... Any Gym Challenger who’s made it this far would be no pushover...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Under normal circumstances, I would have tried to delay you further. However, all the necessary Wishing Stars have been collected. Do as you wish. There is nothing to be done now.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Typical [VAR 0100(0000)]! You and [VAR 0101(0001)] are unstoppable![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Stay on guard...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Everything I did, I did to further the chairman’s own goals...[VAR 0114(0007)]

ROSE: Leon. We’ve discussed this a hundred times already. And still you fail to understand what’s at stake? You, who is supposed to be our Champion...[VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: I think I understand well enough.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What I don’t understand is why we ought to cancel tomorrow’s tournament in order to solve a problem that’s a thousand years away from affecting any of us! What difference is one day going to make?[VAR 0114(0004)]
My duty as Champion isn’t this...this madness. It’s to carry out that Championship Match! That’s what Galar wants—and what I want! It’s what we’ve all been looking forward to for so long![VAR 0114(0004)]
ROSE: No, you don’t understand... You still don’t understand a thing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Look around us, Leon! Look at the Galar region stretched out before us. And know that the energy required to keep this brilliant, glittering world alive will be exhausted a millennium from now! The people of Galar today will no longer even exist. What Galar wants today hardly matters![VAR 0114(0006)]
The future is more important than just one day! We must act as quickly as we possibly can! We must take action in order to avert tragedy! So that all can look forward to a better future![VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: In a thousand years! Fine. Look. I think I understand your concerns, Chairman. And I give my word I’ll help you with your plans... just as soon as tomorrow’s match is over.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee... You never showed when you were supposed to, so I got worried that something had happened... Piers and Marnie and all those Team Yell oddballs, they all helped us out to get here...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I must apologize to you, Hop, if we’ve made you worry at all. There are times when adults just can’t seem to have an honest discussion with one another. Sometimes our pride just gets in the way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Never mind any of this, Hop, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s head back to the hotel, and we’ll all grab dinner together, yeah? It’s on me, so you can order whatever you fancy.[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’ll excuse us, Chairman Rose... And I do hope you’ll watch tomorrow’s match. It’s sure to be one for the history books.[VAR 0114(0004)]
One for the history books... You still don’t understand, young Champion... We... No, I am going to change the course of history![VAR 0114(0006)]

The next evening...
This is it. Did you get enough sleep?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You and your team are the ones battling, but I’ve had Butterfree in my stomach since I woke up...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]? The Finals will be starting shortly. I’m here to escort you to the stadium.
What’s all this! Didn’t learn your lesson yesterday?! If you need another helping of Hop and his trusty [VAR 0101(0001)], I’ll be happy to give you one![VAR 0114(0005)]
No! Wait, please! I’m not like those other League staff! I’m a good one! If I may say so myself...
I heard about what happened yesterday. Ms. Oleana can be a little extreme in her desire to assist the chairman with his goals, I’m afraid.
It seems she was cultivating her own group of League staff in secret to be deployed for... well...things like that debacle last night.
But you’ve no need to worry about today’s staff! All of us are here for the right reasons.
Well, that’s what she says... I guess we trust her, then, yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Let’s go! I can’t wait another minute![VAR 0114(0005)]
Would you like me to show you the way to Wyndon Stadium?
Then let’s be on our way!
Understood. Come talk with me again if you need any help, or use one of the Flying Taxis out front.

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it. Here at Wyndon Stadium, the greatest stadium in all Galar... You’re gonna show everyone the greatest battle ever, mate, and set the world on fire![VAR 0114(0005)]
So go get yourself checked in![VAR 0114(0005)]

Text File : main_event_1675

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]. We’ve been waiting for you. Since you won your way through the Semifinals, you must face off against the Gym Leaders in the Finals. And they won’t be holding back. Whoever makes it through this final bracket will win the right to challenge the Champion... So, are you ready to go to the locker room now?
Yes, straightaway
Not yet
Then I’ll show you the way.
Then let me know when you’re ready.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1680
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Will you be heading onto the pitch? The opening ceremony should be starting soon.
I’m ready!
Not yet
Then in you go!
Would you like to speak with the others for one last spot of advice?
I’ll always press on and challenge myself so that I can go on as a Pokémon Trainer for as long as possible. As long as you continue to push yourself, your brilliance will never fade.[VAR 0114(0010)]
My first match is against Raihan of all people? What rotten luck... But even if he changes the weather around, I don’t plan on throwing in the towel so easy.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Long time no see! This’ll be a different sort of battle than you faced in the Gym Challenge. Those were basically test matches, but this... This is serious battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s a curious feeling... My heart is racing a bit, but I still can’t wait for the match to begin![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll be bringing my matches to an end in a heartbeat—you’ll see. No one who sees them will ever forget me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m going to win my way through every round, then I’ll be the one taking on Leon! If I don’t, then I’ll have failed to repay Duraludon and the rest of my team for all their hard work![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’d say I aim to win this thing... And I’ll do it without usin’ Dynamax, to help everyone in Spikemuth reclaim their pride... and to see ’em smile once again.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The opening ceremony will begin momentarily. Please head to the pitch at once.

In that case, please head on out to the pitch.
I understand. Please make sure you’re well prepared so that you have no regrets.

Text File : main_event_1705
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wait, you![VAR 0114(0042)]
Who’s that?[VAR 0114(006B)]
A moment, if I may. Does anyone here even remember me? I am Bede, the challenger who was forced to withdraw from the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede! He’s the challenger endorsed by Chairman Rose himself![VAR 0114(006B)]
I have a score to settle with Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] here. I’m aware that this is against the rules, but I must ask nonetheless... Let me battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer! I’ll stake my career as a challenger on this battle. If I lose, I’ll retire from being a Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What an unexpected turn of events! Former Challenger Bede has come for one last battle![VAR 0114(0018)]
We are currently debating what to do with Challenger Bede. To all our viewers, both here in the stadium and at home in front of the telly, we ask that you please be patient![VAR 0114(0018)]
I know this is ridiculous of me. But I had to say something...do something![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ever since you showed up, everything I’ve done has gone wrong! It was Oleana who asked me to gather Wishing Stars for the chairman, but then the chairman himself disowned me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And then that strange old lady comes out of nowhere and drags me into a boot camp on Fairy-type Pokémon! Do you have any idea what I’ve been through?! Covered in pink, dealing with quizzes and battles with Fairy-type Pokémon every day![VAR 0114(000C)]
And here I am, pouring my heart out to you... when I’ve never lost my cool before![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve reached a decision, ladies and gentlemen! The Champion himself has accepted Bede’s sudden interruption! Is the Champion showing his love...by giving every Trainer a chance to grow stronger? Or is it a trial for Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
My will hasn’t been broken yet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I lost...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It looks like Challenger Bede was no match for Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trusted team![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, Bede! That was some match![VAR 0114(006B)]
Don’t retire! Just restart your career![VAR 0114(006B)]
B-but this isn’t what I planned! If I was able to defeat you, then everything would be fine. Even if I lost, I was going to use retiring as an excuse to get away from that old lady![VAR 0114(000C)]
You just keep messing up my plans! With everyone cheering me on like this, I have no choice but to continue my training as the Fairy-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000C)]
Though I suppose with my talents, I’ll be able to overtake Ms. Opal in no time.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The stadium is filled with voices cheering on these two young Trainers! Now, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], please head back to the locker room so that you can rest up from that unexpected match...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Rather surprising for Challenger Bede to barge in like that... In any case, once you’re ready, please head onto the pitch. The Finals are about to begin.

The time for waiting is over! The Finals of the Champion Cup are about to begin! The two Trainers to face each other in the first battle of the first round are...[VAR 0114(0018)]
A Trainer endorsed by the Champion himself, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
H[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser opponent is... the raging wave! The master of Water types, Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
I can tell you’ve grown far stronger since you faced me in Hulbury Stadium. I’ve got to hand it to our undefeated Champion. He’s got a proper eye for talent, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
But you’re not the Champion, and you’ll never become the Champion, either. Do you know why? It’s because I, Nessa, am going to defeat both you and Leon![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m not going to underestimate you again. I’ll use Dynamax to wash you out to sea and beyond the horizon![VAR 0114(000F)]
Aaaaaand the winner is...[VAR 0100(0000)]! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe defeated Nessa during the Gym Challenge and now has pulled it off again![VAR 0114(0018)]
You and your Pokémon are just too much... Even with my Dynamaxed partner, you weathered our waves and stood firm.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Now that I think about it, Sonia was saying something about how amazing you were. I wish I’d paid more attention to what she was talking about.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I bet everyone in Galar’s got their eyes on you now. You defeated my team, so now you’ve got to ride that current all the way to the end![VAR 0114(000F)]
Now...don’t go anywhere, ladies and gentlemen! The second battle of the first round will begin shortly![VAR 0114(0018)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1720
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ladies and gentlemen, we’re already at the second match of the Finals! Of the four remaining challengers, which two will be left for the last match?![VAR 0114(0018)]
If you’re just tuning in, ladies and gentlemen, we witnessed quite the surprise during the Finals here at this year’s Champion Cup, as the former Gym Challenger Bede stormed the stage! But [VAR 0100(0000)] was having none of it! This year’s top challenger made quick work of him before washing away Gym Leader Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
On the other side, we have... the Galar karate prodigy! Let’s hear it for Gym Leader Bea, everybody![VAR 0114(0018)]
I promise you, my attacks will shake your very soul this time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
May the best Trainer win.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Bea has been defeated! Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] has shown h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser skill![VAR 0114(0018)]
Thank you for a wonderful match.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I really enjoyed battling you and your team... I’m upset that I lost, but I also feel so satisfied and so refreshed...[VAR 0114(0011)]
In a way, I guess you could say it was the best sort of match anyone could ever hope for.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I hope that you’ll meet many more Trainers and have many more matches in the future. And I hope that every one of those encounters will nourish your spirit.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The next match will begin in no time, so stay in those seats, folks![VAR 0114(0018)]

I remember you... You were the strongest Gym Challenger I had. Er...so I reckon...we sh-should battle![VAR 0114(0012)]

I thought my bro could get revenge for me, but he lost to Raihan.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You looked so sloppy out there that people are gonna think we’re both weak ’cause we’re related![VAR 0114(000D)]
You got it wrong, Sis. Raihan’s just that strong. But I was able to show everyone in the audience how amazin’ a proper battle without usin’ Dynamax can be.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, I get it! But that’s exactly why I wanted you to win! I still thought it was a brilliant battle, though...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m countin’ on you to win, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Got that? I’ll be cheerin’ for you.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Will it be the brilliant rising star, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Or will it be the only Trainer that Champion Leon calls his rival... the tamer of dragons, Raihan?![VAR 0114(0018)]
You’re really something else, kid. You’ve made it all the way here! I guess that’s why the Champion himself endorsed you, yeah?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Leon’s my rival—and he chose you. So I’ve got to first prove I’m better than you if I’m to beat him! I’ve reworked my whole team, and now we’re all geared up for one-on-one battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
You might be thinking that you beat me once already... But if you think I’m the same Raihan you faced during the Gym Challenge, you’ll soon regret it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] seizes victory![VAR 0114(0018)]
My lovely Pokémon and I have become much stronger than we were before... But you just blew right past us! Beyond anything I’d imagined![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m still pretty young myself, but it just goes to show that there’s always someone younger coming up, reaching further than you ever dreamed... And you’ve got your whole future ahead of you![VAR 0114(0017)]
Keep up the momentum! Prove that Leon’s not unbeatable![VAR 0114(0017)]
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], has achieved a dazzling triumph! The Trainer who was endorsed by the Champion will now face the very man who endorsed h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0018)]

It can fill you with fear knowing that, but I absolutely love pushing past the fear. I love giving it everything I’ve got as a Trainer and seeing my team give everything they’ve got to seize another victory! It’s the greatest feeling in the world, and I can’t get enough of it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I can feel my partners itching with anticipation inside their Poké Balls... We’re going to have a real champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

That video stream... That was from Hammerlocke Stadium, right? What in the world did the chairman do...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know! But everything he was saying yesterday... Did he really pull this crazy stunt to solve some problem a thousand years in the future?! I’ve got to go see what’s going on... I’m the Champion! I have to go![VAR 0114(0004)]
I should’ve realized what the chairman intended to do before it came to this... I’ll take responsibility now for fixing this mess![VAR 0114(0004)]
This is the real Champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
But, Lee! You’re terrible at directions... What if you get lost along the way?[VAR 0114(0005)]

You can help!
Just try!
Easy for you to say...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But what? What can I even do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold the phone... The chairman was talking about the Darkest Day. That’s that thing where the sky went all dark once, ages and ages ago, right? What does he mean, he’s bringing that about? And where did we even hear that name...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Back in Motostoke
That statue of the hero...
That statue of the hero in Motostoke! Sonia said something back then, didn’t she... Though it turned out to be wrong, since there were actually two heroes and all that. Still! Those two managed to bring an end to the Darkest Day with the sword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia thought the Pokémon might still be sleeping somewhere though, right? We should try to find them, [VAR 0100(0000)]! But where to start looking...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Back in the Slumbering Weald?
Back home in Postwick?
Maybe in Circhester?
You sure about that? I dunno... Doesn’t feel right to me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m sure it’s got to be the Slumbering Weald! That illusion you tried to fight off that day— it must’ve been one of the Pokémon that are supposed to be sleeping there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go back to the Slumbering Weald! If we’re lucky, we’ll find something that can help![VAR 0114(0005)]

Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] and Hop? Ah! I completely forgot about the Championship Match! What’re you two doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Haven’t you been watching the news at all? The tournament is off, Sonia! The chairman saw to that—and to sending the entire region into a state of havoc![VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh? What?! What happened while I was researching things in the Slumbering Weald?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, for starters, there’s a great black storm or something raging over Hammerlocke Stadium. What’re they calling it? “The Darkest Day”? It’s thrown everything into disarray![VAR 0114(0008)]
Still, I’m sure we don’t need to worry too much... The unbeatable Champion will be able to take care of everything, won’t he?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on a tick, ma’am. Did you say “the Darkest Day”?[VAR 0114(000B)]
“The Darkest Day” is the name for the black storm that nearly brought the Galar region to ruin in ancient times...[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what’re you here for, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m here to stop the Darkest Day!
To search for the sword Pokémon
To search for the shield Pokémon
To stop the Darkest Day... You mean you’re going to search for the sword and shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I suppose if the legends are true, then the sword and shield Pokémon should be able to prevent the Darkest Day from coming to pass... They may be just what we need to beat back the black storm![VAR 0114(000B)]
OK! Here, take this. You should head to the Slumbering Weald. I’ll catch up with you once I’m done looking into something that’s been bothering me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got to keep looking into the origin of the sword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
All that matters is that you do what you can. You’ve become a fine Pokémon Trainer, after all![VAR 0114(0008)]

Ready for this, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I wonder if we’re about to head straight into a wall of fog again... Not that it’d bother us now. We’ve both grown loads stronger and so have our Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Going into the forest after Wooloo that day... That was the start of everything, wasn’t it? A legendary beginning, really...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon whatever we’re about to see will be pretty legendary itself! Let’s head in and add another page to our tale![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey! Where’re you going?! We need your help over here![VAR 0114(0005)]
You two... What in the world are you doing?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! Come off it, Sonia! You must’ve seen that, right?! Those...those...sword and shield Pokémon! They were right in front of us! But then they disappeared into the forest...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, you sure you haven’t lost the plot? There was no one here but the two of you...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha... Then were those just...illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen! I dug into some literature from other regions, and I finally found something! Mentions of the sword Pokémon, Zacian, and the shield Pokémon, called Zamazenta. The writings said that those two Pokémon were born somewhere beyond the Slumbering Weald sometime long, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Did they really? Ta, Sonia. Thanks for digging into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Even if it is just an illusion or whatever, we did manage to find that Pokémon again... Maybe the sword and the shield that those two used to carry are still here, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Zacian and Zamazenta... They may have been sleeping in the Slumbering Weald right next to your hometown all this time. Perhaps that’s why no one has entered the deepest parts of these woods for so long...[VAR 0114(000B)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1865

Would you take a look at that, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Now that’s something you don’t see every day... This place definitely feels like the stuff of legend.[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1870

See that, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
The sword and the shield! The legends really were true![VAR 0114(0005)]
That settles it! I’m taking the shield![VAR 0114(0005)]
That settles it! I’m taking the sword![VAR 0114(0005)]
Though...wow, would you look at the state of this thing? It seems like it might fall to pieces if you so much as look at it funny. I don’t know if these rusty old things will really be able to stop the Darkest Day, but... Well, I guess it can’t hurt to have them along! Let’s hope they bring us some good luck![VAR 0114(0005)]

Maybe the Pokémon themselves really are still asleep somewhere. So it seems we’re on our own if we want to go help Lee. This is all the help we’ve got![VAR 0114(0005)]
If anybody’s gonna help Lee now, I guess it’s just you and me, mate! He’s probably still at Hammerlocke Stadium, trying to keep the Darkest Day at bay. So what d’you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Wanna grab a Flying Taxi to head right there?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go!
Not yet
Then let’s get out of this gloomy forest and fly back to Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Can’t say I blame you... Even I’m a bit gutted to have come all this way chasing legends only to find a rusty old sword and shield...[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1875
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hop! It’s a real shame, the way things have turned out. You make it all the way to the Championship Match, then something like this has to happen![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Chairman Rose thinking that the energy pouring from the Darkest Day would somehow be the key to saving Galar’s future? It all seems a bit mad, if you ask me... I can’t follow at all how that’s supposed to work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, I don’t care if I’m up against the Darkest Day or the chairman or whatever! I’m going ahead! I’m off to help my brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And he’s gone... That Hop never changes. Always in a rush about something, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0017)]
The key thing is that no one’s been harmed. We Gym Leaders worked together with the city’s Pokémon, and we’ve got everyone evacuated.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you, you’re fixing to help our Champion? To save everyone in the Galar region?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Of course I am
That’s where I’m going now!
Our greatest-ever Champion and the greatest- ever challenger, along with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser fiercest rival... all teaming up against the Darkest Day... I almost feel sorry for it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Go on then, our great challenger! Into Hammerlocke Stadium with you![VAR 0114(0017)]

G-Gym Challenger! You must help me! I-I mean, please, help me![VAR 0114(0007)]
My Pokémon suddenly Dynamaxed for some reason and started running amok in the stadium...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Raihan...I mean, Mr. Raihan was able to subdue the Dynamax Pokémon in the stadium, but...[VAR 0114(0007)]
If other Pokémon also Dynamax and go on a rampage...[VAR 0114(0007)]
the underground power plant would collapse! Mr. Rose is down there right now![VAR 0114(0007)]
I know this is selfish of me, but I must beg your assistance! I want you to head into the underground power plant and stop Mr. Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mr. Rose has awakened a Pokémon known as Eternatus... Apparently, the energy emitted from its body is what causes Dynamaxing.[VAR 0114(0007)]
At this rate, all the Pokémon in the Galar region will Dynamax and go berserk! If that were to happen—[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please, you must save Mr. Rose! You can take the lift over there to reach him. I’ve enlisted the help of the Champion’s younger brother, too, but who knows what is going on...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh no... Eternatus is— Oh, Mr. Rose...[VAR 0114(0007)]

What...what is all this?! We need to help Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
And what do you plan on doing, Gym Challenger?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Stopping the Darkest Day!
Helping the Champion
Uh, pardon? What are you talking about? There’s nothing to stop now. We’ve already brought about the Darkest Day...or should I say, the ultimate Pokémon—Eternatus![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m afraid I can’t allow that. The Champion is the one who needs to control Eternatus.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Must I explain myself? From your perspective, I suppose it must seem that I am doing something terrible. I don’t expect you to understand. But I must provide the Galar region with limitless energy to ensure everlasting prosperity. It is my purpose, my duty, my destiny![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why we’ve been giving the Wishing Stars to Eternatus! Surely you remember the red light that caused a ruckus around Hammerlocke. That was all part of our experiments to awaken Eternatus! You must understand. I can’t let you interfere with my plan to protect the future of Galar![VAR 0114(0006)]

Most impressive, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I wouldn’t expect any less from a challenger endorsed by the strongest Champion ever to grace our beloved Galar region![VAR 0114(0006)]
I really do wish I could have seen the Championship Match between you two. And I’m terribly sorry to have ruined the whole Gym Challenge and everything![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s too bad, but it can’t be helped... In order to solve the energy issue as soon as possible, we awakened Eternatus. But we couldn’t control it. The Champion came to aid me, even at the cost of abandoning the match.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Indeed, just like a knight in shining armor coming to rescue a princess from a dragon![VAR 0114(0006)]
I do tend to ramble on, I know. I love to make speeches. But I think I can stop talking now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think the Champion should have captured Eternatus by now. If you’re curious, you can take the lift up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I trust you’ll be going too, right, Hop? I certainly hope losing to me didn’t discourage you too much. Go on now, both of you! Go see how our Champion is doing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Discouraged...? You don’t get it, do you, Chairman? Neither me nor my Pokémon are anywhere near giving up! We’ve learned how to be strong, thanks to the Gym Challenge you organized![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I’m ready for anything. Are you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
Give me a moment
Wouldn’t expect any less from my rival! Now, come on! We’ve got to help Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, we’ve no idea what’s going on up there. Better be sure you’re really ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I won’t stop you. Head up via the lift, if you wish![VAR 0114(0006)]

But no need for you kids to worry. It seems like some power of Eternatus’s was keeping my team from Dynamaxing, but... we’ve had a champion time all the same![VAR 0114(0004)]
Charizard and the rest of my champion team members have really worn Eternatus down.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now if I can simply catch it in a Poké Ball, we should be able to get this madness under control. Then everything will be back to normal. So watch this! It’s going to be a real champion catch![VAR 0114(0004)]

Three days later...
So, Chairman Rose turned himself in, then? Never thought I’d live to see the day...
He awoke Eternatus and nearly caused a catastrophe for the entire region! You reap what you sow, I say.
I don’t know about you, but I slept like the dead![VAR 0114(0005)]
Everyone’s still talking about what happened, but at least things are back to normal now. We really did defeat Eternatus together with Zamazenta and Zacian![VAR 0114(0005)]
And still Lee’s...well, he’s being Lee. Insisting on having a Championship Match with you today. It’s a bit much, isn’t it? You sure you’re up for it? I’m not even too sure about him. He was out cold and hurt pretty badly himself during all that mess.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do understand how he feels, though. Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to get to see you and him face off in a serious match.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So come on! The match’ll be at Wyndon Stadium. Where else![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s time for the match. Please head to the pitch.

This is the final match against the Champion. The Championship Match! Are you ready to face Leon?
I’m ready to beat him!
I still need to get ready
Then change into your uniform, and head out onto the pitch!
There’s no turning back now!
My matches are always sold out, but this... I’ve never seen a crowd this wild![VAR 0114(0004)]
Everyone knows what you did for us this week, [VAR 0100(0000)]... They know you’re the one who caught Eternatus and saved the future of the Galar region.[VAR 0114(0004)]
A real hero, who battled alongside the Legendary Pokémon, Zacian and Zamazenta... I couldn’t have dreamed of a better challenger to help increase my winning streak![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh... And you’ve even added Eternatus to your party. The greatest challenger along with the most powerful Pokémon—is that it? Now you’re really getting me excited![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now that I’ve seen just what kind of strength you possess as the greatest of challengers... crushing you into the dirt will show everyone just how strong their Champion truly is![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s make this a final match that’ll go down in Galar’s history! No! A match that’ll change Galar forever![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re gonna have an absolutely champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?! What’re you doing here in the woods?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What about you?
The truth is...
Nobody ever comes in here, since this is the forest where Zacian and Zamazenta rested. It’s the best place to do a bit of thinking, since it’s so quiet and all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you here, [VAR 0100(0000)]? That’s... Mate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you here? That’s... Mate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve been thinking, you know... Maybe the reason Zacian and Zamazenta chose a place like this to sleep was because no one ever comes here and it’s so quiet all the time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, but I hadn’t had the chance to tell you! Congrats on your victory, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Honestly, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I never thought you’d manage to beat my brother. The greatest Champion Galar ever had! He was undefeatable till you came around![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s actually still pretty hard to believe...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Really... You’re amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
So amazing, maybe, that I don’t even realize just how amazing you really are![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], do you think... Would you be up for one more battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]

So, the Champion thinks [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she can make me wait, is that it? Come on! Let’s have a battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, there really is no way I could ever beat you... I mean, you even beat my “unbeatable” brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And if it isn’t the two of you again. I was wondering what all the noise was about.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And if it isn’t Sonia.[VAR 0114(0005)]

[~ 10]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Congratulations on beating Leon![VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you
It was nothing...
Taking it all in stride like it’s your due, eh? You cheeky thing![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, trying to act modest, are you? Go on—you’ve earned the right to be proud![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be off assisting the professor?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, I’m actually not working as my gran’s assistant any longer...[VAR 0114(000B)]
In fact... I’m the professor now![VAR 0114(000B)]
Y-you are?![VAR 0114(0005)]
And really, I’ve got the two of you to thank for that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I was just along for the ride on your adventure, but I ended up taking a real interest in the history of the Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And I came to care for Pokémon even more than I ever had before![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah, here! It’s a book I wrote! I even signed it—that makes it a collector’s item.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You received a copy of Sonia’s Book!
[~ 25]
[~ 26]
I’ve already got my own copy. Lined up to buy it on the day it came out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Aww, thanks, Hop! That’s so sweet. I’ll sign your copy for you later.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, I’ve got my gran’s blessing and put out my first book under my own name... I think you can expect great things of the lovely Professor Sonia in the future, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, I expect so... Sonia and [VAR 0100(0000)], you both amaze me! I’ve got a lot to live up to here![VAR 0114(0005)]
So? What are you young’ns doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, oh, right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ohhh... That’s it, isn’t it? You were putting the Rusted Sword and the Rusted Shield back in their place?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t just keep holding on to them forever, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
We...were! Yeah, that’s what we were doing! We were just about to do that.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You forgot entirely, didn’t you? What, you think the two of you are besties now with Zacian and Zamazenta or something?![VAR 0114(000B)]
That must be it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Why you felt like you were called here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s put the sword and the shield back and say a proper thanks for all the help. Maybe if we do, we’ll get to see Zacian and Zamazenta again someday.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t have the best memories of the Slumbering Weald, but I came to do a quick investigation. Hurry it up, and put the Rusted Sword and the Rusted Shield back where they belong! I’d like to get a photo of them on location.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Return the [VAR 0109(0001)]?
Zacian! Zamazenta! Thanks loads for helping us out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Took us a little while, but we’ve brought back your precious relics and all![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and Hop returned the Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield!
All right! That about settles that. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], why don’t you and I head back?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you gonna do, Sonia?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I’ll stay here a bit longer. I want to do a little more research here in the forest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm? My Power Spot Detector is going off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well... I thought I heard someone making some noise over this way![VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, well, well... You wouldn’t be the Professor Sonia who wrote the book “Galar: A History”?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Eh, ah, hello... You bought my book?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why yes, of course! Read it from cover to cover![VAR 0114(0042)]
Why yes, of course! I even wrote an internet review for it![VAR 0114(0042)]
That awful book was filled with lies... So we gave it one star![VAR 0114(006A)]
What?! There are no lies printed in that book![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s just plain rude![VAR 0114(0005)]
I am Sordward![VAR 0114(0068)]
I am Shielbert![VAR 0114(0069)]
We are the new kings of Galar! We’re descendants of the first kings![VAR 0114(0068)]
More than that, we’re celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
New kings? Descendants? Seriously, what are you on about?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What exactly are you two supposed to be?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well! Could these things here be the fabled sword and shield?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well! They certainly are dirty! They must be fake! I fear to touch them with my bare hands.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sordward took the Rusted Sword!
Shielbert took the Rusted Shield!
Hey! Don’t go nicking those! We just returned them![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, do shut up! We only happened to pick up some things that were dropped on the ground![VAR 0114(0068)]
If you’ve got a problem with it, how about you prove to whom they belong, hmm?[VAR 0114(0069)]
But...there’s no way anyone can prove who those ancient things belong to! Even if we can’t prove it, they’re really important to Zacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh goodness. Such a plebeian, and yet so pushy. If it’s really so important to you, perhaps we should settle this with a battle?[VAR 0114(0068)]
We’re celebrities who buy battles for twice what they’re worth![VAR 0114(0069)]
What does that even mean...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I, the magnificent Sordward, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0068)]
I, the magnificent Shielbert, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0069)]
You took back the [VAR 0109(0001)]!
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable Pokémon I go strolling with... You’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable Pokémon I go strolling with... You’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0069)]
However, it appears that my younger brother was victorious.[VAR 0114(0068)]
However, it appears that my older brother was victorious.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I lost to him...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy? You weren’t concentrating at all during our battle![VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy? You weren’t concentrating at all during our battle![VAR 0114(0068)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Older Brother! Isn’t that the one who stopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Younger Brother! Isn’t that the one who stopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is! What a rude child, snatching up our chance at glory like that.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is! What a rude child, snatching up our chance at glory like that.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources... I believe [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the destruction of the magnificent mural our ancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources... I believe [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the destruction of the magnificent mural our ancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our family has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our family has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0069)]
Mural? You mean the one that hid the historical ruins of [VAR 0101(0001)] and the others? And hold on a moment—[VAR 0100(0000)] wasn’t the one who destroyed it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall bring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0069)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall bring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0068)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes, let’s do that![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
W-wait! Stop! Give back that [VAR 0109(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ugh, that kid. He’s gone and recklessly run off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
At least you’re calm, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I expected as much.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m surprised that Hop lost to someone like that. He looked upset about something during the battle. Maybe that had something to do with it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
His own rival became the new Champion, and his goal vanished before his eyes... You can’t help but wonder how he feels about it all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway! Sordward and Shielbert, was it? I think I might know something about where those two weirdos went...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Shall we go over it at the lab in Wedgehurst?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Of course!
I’m worried about Hop
I bet I didn’t even need to ask! Thanks![VAR 0114(000B)]
I get it... You feel responsible for him and want to help him as soon as you can, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, we’ll meet up later, then! I’ll head back to the lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Text File : main_event_3040

Hm?
Professor Sonia, you have a visitor.
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Glad you’re here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Who’s this?
You got an assistant?
She’s my assistant! I’ve been so busy with research lately that I’ve had to bring on some extra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Spot on! I’ve been busy with my research, so I decided to bring on some extra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been keeping all the Wishing Stars that Chairman Rose had been gathering here in the lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Things have been a little hectic around here, but my assistant has been handling things in a proper fashion. She’s really been helping me keep things afloat.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I really haven’t been doing all that much...
You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], the Champion, right? I’m really glad I get to meet you. It’s an honor, truly.
Come here for a moment, would you? There’s something I want you to have a look at.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember my Power Spot Detector, right? It detects places where Dynamaxing is possible... Basically when there’s a high concentration of Galar particles, the readings spike...[VAR 0114(000B)]
And that’s how I figured it out![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Power Spot Detector reacted when those two got close.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Could it be...?
So what does that mean?
Exactly![VAR 0114(000B)]
Basically...[VAR 0114(000B)]
follow the readings from the Power Spot Detector, and you might be able to find those sword and shield weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sordward and Shielbert might claim to be royalty, with their weird, fancy names. But it’s easier to just call them weirdos, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s get back on topic, though![VAR 0114(000B)]
I placed Power Spot Detectors all around Galar, and now it’s their time to shine.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Power Spot Detectors—access![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, whoa! That’s a way bigger reaction than I would’ve thought! Looks like it’s coming from... Turffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You could always Dynamax Pokémon at the stadium, so that’s not exactly unusual. But these readings are way higher than normal![VAR 0114(000B)]
It can’t be Eternatus... You already caught it. Maybe it’s something related to those sword and shield weirdos?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You should go check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Since you’re our snazzy new Champion and all![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve set up your Town Map to show where the strong particle reactions are coming from, so have a look at it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll leave looking into Turffield to you. I’ll stay here and try to look into those rude weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m so glad to be working for Professor Sonia. To have a doctorate at such a young age... She’s really an amazing person.

Hm? You’re...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hello there, Champion! So, you came![VAR 0114(000E)]
What’s going on here?
It’s been a while
Hah! How carefree can you be? You’re the new Champion. You’re bigger than a Dynamax Pokémon right now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I was actually in the middle of an exhibition match with Piers. Then this Dynamax Pokémon came charging in.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The audience and staff already took shelter.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Gyaaan!
I got everyone who was seated on the north side of the stadium evacuated! You must’ve heard, right? More Dynamax Pokémon are running amok![VAR 0114(0005)]
Much obliged, Hop! I’d expect nothing less from a Gym Challenger. I knew we could count on you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I lost in the Semifinals, though...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I chased those red and blue guys and saw them head into Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then I heard that uproar, and there was no way I could leave it alone. I had to help out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, er... Sorry! I actually lost sight of them in all the rush.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm. Those suspicious characters you saw are concerning...[VAR 0114(000E)]
But for now, I think we should get this Dynamax Pokémon to settle down first![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’d be glad for your help against such a tough- looking opponent, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Of course!
Hold on a sec
All right. Then let’s head to the pitch.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll lend a hand, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t blame the Pokémon, of course, but I’m still just a bit miffed they upstaged me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You come too, bro of the old Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t know how much I can really help...[VAR 0114(0005)]
If I come along, I might just end up slowing the rest of you down...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t really know the guy, but I don’t think Leon’d be all lost about this. Though he does get actually lost a lot...[VAR 0114(0016)]
You comin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh... OK![VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers might look scary, but he’s great at looking after others. He’s a big brother, after all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right, we should get going, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
OK! Preparation is as important as laying seeds for the next harvest.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you ready to battle the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Usin’ Pokémon to ruin this stage... The Trainers that did this ain’t gettin’ off easy if I find ’em.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I wonder if there’s anything more I can do?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Mugyuuu.
Milo used a Revive!
Shaaanari.
Phew... Looks like things’ve finally calmed down a bit.[VAR 0114(000E)]
This Dynamax stuff... No matter how many times I see it, I still don’t like it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I can see your dislike of Dynamaxing still hasn’t changed, Piers.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But there was definitely something off about that Dynamax transformation...[VAR 0114(000E)]
There wasn’t any Trainer anywhere! And the Pokémon seemed like it couldn’t even control the power itself...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Quite right... Normally, a Pokémon needs to respond to a Dynamax Band in order to Dynamax, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Seems there was some discord in the harmony between Trainer and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Did you feel anything unusual, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I did
I’m not sure
So you noticed something was off, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Hmm, well, I suppose it is a bit early to start drawing any conclusions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s no Trainer to be found. This really is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll make sure Turffield Gym takes good care of this Pokémon for the time being.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 24]
You lot really helped me out here. Thanks for that.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, and [VAR 0100(0000)]! If you should ever need my help, feel free to call me anytime.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right then. Follow me, little Tsareena.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Shaaanari.
Well, well, well! Looks like that Dynamax nonsense has calmed down.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well. The Champion, as expected.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Ah! It’s you two! I knew you’d be here! Give the [VAR 0109(0001)] back![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I never. It’s not like it’s something that belongs to you, either.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Even if it were yours, we wouldn’t give it back.[VAR 0114(0069)]
What’s with these two! Arrrghhh! Get over here so I can battle you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Who are these guys?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Spectators and staff should’ve been evacuated.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The normal rules simply just don’t apply to us![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes! That’s what it means to be celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
What?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Who is this ruffian to question us? You’re just someone with strange taste in hairstyles![VAR 0114(0068)]
His entire style is complete black and white nonsense. Isn’t it, Older Brother?[VAR 0114(0069)]
You think I’d put any faith in words from rude little punks like you?[VAR 0114(0016)]
But it seems our experiment was a success, Younger Brother.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Quite, quite. Next time let us try to Dynamax an even stronger Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, yes! At last we shall reveal the true nature of Zacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0068)]
What was that about Zacian and Zamazenta?![VAR 0114(0005)]
You, despicable Champion! We’re going to keep letting Dynamax Pokémon run wild![VAR 0114(0069)]
If you want to stop us, do your best to chase after our splendid-looking bottoms![VAR 0114(0068)]
More like...celebrity bottoms![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
So you were the ones who caused all this? Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Calm down, Hop. You don’t gotta act so hard.[VAR 0114(0016)]
B-but they’re getting away![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, and they could be leadin’ us to a trap. It’s a bad idea to run in unprepared.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ughhh... Fine. You’re right. I get it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good. Let’s all calm down for a sec.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Thanks to them runnin’ their mouths, we know their goal is to force Pokémon to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And that they plan to continue doing it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I won’t allow it!
We have to stop them!
Yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is no time to be hung up on getting back the [VAR 0109(0001)]... [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Piers! We’ve got to stop those two![VAR 0114(0005)]
How’re those two makin’ Pokémon Dynamax without any Dynamax Bands?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Where would those red and blue buffoons have gone off to next? Let’s head out and look, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Text File : main_event_3070

Ah, there you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Things are a right proper mess![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just when I thought the Galar particle count around Turffield had calmed down...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I started getting huge Galar particle readings from Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium![VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what exactly happened at Turffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Explain exactly what happened
Exaggerate what happened
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon went on a rampage?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon completely destroyed the stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait... Turffield Stadium is still there.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh? Those sword and shield weirdos did it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm? Hop and...Piers?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Piers, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be back in Spikemuth?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m an ex-Gym Leader. I can be wherever I want. It’s not that weird![VAR 0114(0016)]
More importantly, you said there were Dynamax Pokémon at other stadiums?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. I’m getting the same readings in other towns as I was from Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m worried about Marnie![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, but Spikemuth Gym should be OK, right? I’m only seeing readings from Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah... I see.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If Pokémon are being forced to Dynamax and running wild, there’s no way I can simply sit by and watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s head to one of the stadiums!
I want to chase after those two weirdos!
Heh. That’s the spirit, Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Even if we wanna go after them, we don’t know where they went...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Leave those sword and shield weirdos to me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I can poke around the net for sightings of them![VAR 0114(000B)]
We’ll leave the researchin’ to this, er... Sonia, was it? We should get to the other stadiums and help out.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll catch up to you in a bit, so head out first. I’ll leave it up to you to decide which stadium we handle first.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If someone’s in trouble, then I want to help! So, let’s get out there and do our best. All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos stick out like a sore thumb. It shouldn’t be too hard to find them. Time for a little searching on social media![VAR 0114(000B)]

Don’t get too close, you lot! Things are pretty dangerous here![VAR 0114(000F)]
We know the situation. Are the staff and spectators all right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. They took shelter just a short while ago...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Y’know, the more I look at you three, the more I see how odd a little group you are.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Tch. Leave us alone.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We came here to help you out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m grateful for it. That Dynamax Pokémon’s power is so intense I’m sure it’d give me trouble.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d feel a lot more confident about it if you all joined the battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s do it![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Because of everyone’s help, no one was hurt and we were able to turn the tide of the situation.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll keep that Pokémon at Hulbury Stadium until it can fully recover.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... If you ever need my help, just let me know.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I suppose I’ll see you later, then? Thank you so much for your help, truly.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]! And Piers and Hop, too![VAR 0114(0010)]
Mr. Kabu! I’m glad you remember me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I do! You two were red-hot, after all! I’ll never forget seeing you off after you’d completed your first leg of the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oi, can we save the nostalgia for later?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t think we really got the time for a friendly chin-wag.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right! Actually...the situation’s getting pretty bad over at the stadium.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Yeah. That’d be why we’re here.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, brilliant! The opponent’s a bit much to take on single-handedly, so I was wondering what to do.[VAR 0114(0010)]
But with you all at my side, my confidence in this battle is burning brighter by the minute![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s begin![VAR 0114(0010)]

Looks like we were able to extinguish things this time.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll let this Pokémon rest here at Motostoke Stadium until it gets its energy back.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)], should you have need of my help, please do not hesitate to ask.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t worry—I know... You all have more work that needs to be done, yes?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Go forward, youths! I wish you well![VAR 0114(0010)]

*beep beep beep*
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]? That your Rotom Phone ringing?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We’ve got trouble! Those two weirdos have showed up at the Pokémon Lab![VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! Sonia, you all right?![VAR 0114(0005)]
They keep rudely demanding I hand over Wishing Stars. I’m all right for now, but get over here quick, OK? These guys are right creepy![VAR 0114(000B)]
*beep*
What’re those two doin’ goin’ after Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’ve got to help Sonia and get back the [VAR 0109(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s hurry to the Pokémon Lab![VAR 0114(0005)]
He really doesn’t think anythin’ through... Sure does make him seem a proper fool. Nah, guess the word would be “reckless.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’re headed to the Pokémon Lab next, right? Guess I’ll stick by you till we see this through.[VAR 0114(0016)]

We know all the Wishing Stars that Chairman Rose had gathered are here. We celebrities have an enhanced level of insight into such things![VAR 0114(0068)]
You noncelebrities are not suited to having such valuable things. Hand them over to us.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wishing Stars and being a celebrity have nothing to do with each other![VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t know how you knew about this, but there’s no way we’re giving them to you![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! You could never understand how important these Wishing Stars are. You have no need for them![VAR 0114(000A)]
Goodness. Whatever should we do, Younger Brother?[VAR 0114(0068)]
It would certainly seem we have been inconvenienced, Older Brother.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah!
Sonia and the professor are the ones who’ve been inconvenienced here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Forcing Pokémon to Dynamax against their will... You’ve gone way out of bounds here![VAR 0114(0005)]
And I haven’t forgot about getting back the [VAR 0109(0001)], either![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, well, well! I certainly thought the Champion would come, but I didn’t think a loser would follow.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Must I have you once again taste the flavor of a humiliating defeat?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Rrrghhh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t let these goons put you down![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0016)]
You lost a battle, but don’t lose that rockin’ spirit![VAR 0114(0016)]
R-right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Steady on
We’ll fight them together
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Thanks, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
First thing’s first! Let’s get these weirdos out of here![VAR 0114(0005)]
W— W-w-w... W-w-w...WEIRDOS?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oh, how they wound me, Older Brother! To be called so terrible a thing as “weirdos” by these ruffians![VAR 0114(0069)]
Indeed! To address royals such as ourselves in such a manner cannot—will not—be forgiven![VAR 0114(0068)]
This time I’ve brought much stronger Pokémon to thoroughly trounce you with![VAR 0114(0069)]
I did it... We won! We really won![VAR 0114(0005)]
The exquisite Pokémon we trained actually lost?![VAR 0114(0068)]
Harumph! You only won because you two teamed up. Still, we offer you ruffians our praise.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Oi. The two of you teamed up, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Give back the [VAR 0109(0001)], and stop forcing Pokémon to go all crazy![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, sorry... Is this a bad time?
My apologies for the intrusion.
Those men are dangerous! Be careful![VAR 0114(000B)]
... ... ...
Well done. Your infiltration mission was a resounding success, it seems.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Have you gathered the Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, thanks to Masters Sordward and Shielbert buying me so much time.
The assistant handed the Wishing Stars over to Sordward and Shielbert!
What? Stop! Give back those Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh dear... It would seem we’ve been completely had.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Fwaheeheehoho! Why, this moment is so sweet, I don’t think I’ll need any sugar in my tea later![VAR 0114(0068)]
Our battle with you was just a little trick! We’d won before you’d grabbed a single Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell!
Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Why?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Professor Sonia...I’m sorry.
Was everything... Was it all a lie, right from the start?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There was no helping it. It was necessary for the plan.
Our plan to put Galar under the control of the royal lineage once again...
... ... ...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I think she’s gonna need some cheerin’ from her real friends.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So those two weren’t working alone? One of their followers even betrayed Sonia... That’s real rough...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems that lot did have something to back up all their big talk...[VAR 0114(000A)]

Text File : main_event_3098

Wait! Don’t just leave without saying anything![VAR 0114(000B)]
But...you were upset. We didn’t want to say anything to make it worse.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We were tryin’ to be considerate, but...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Of course I’d be down on myself! It was my fault I got tricked by a Nickit in Wooloo’s clothing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But that’s it! No more feeling sorry for myself![VAR 0114(000B)]
That lot made off like bandits with all the Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’d be awful if they were used for some evil purpose, so there’s no time to be feeling down![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh. Hehehe... You’ve got some guts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’ve certainly grown strong in the face of adversity, dearie.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gran...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Dynamaxing draws out the true strength from the trust between a Pokémon and their Trainer.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But that group is likely pouring the Galar particles emitted by the Wishing Stars into Pokémon, forcing them to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s awful!
That would explain the theft...
Indeed. What an awful thing to do to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As expected of the Champion. Your intuition is quite sharp, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
The theft of the Wishing Stars was just the start. Things could get a lot worse from here on.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But why? What reason could they have for forcing Pokémon to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Those weirdos said that they wanted to reveal the true natures of Zacian and Zamazenta.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m curious about what my former assistant said about a royal lineage. Did she mean it literally?[VAR 0114(000B)]
...Ah! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Look at your Town Map![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m detecting huge reactions at four stadiums now![VAR 0114(000B)]
They certainly get around, don’t they?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If there’s trouble at the stadiums, then Marnie could be in a real bad way![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, Spikemuth seems to be OK. There’s no Power Spot stadium there...[VAR 0114(000B)]
*ahem* Righto...[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! This is no time to be lying about![VAR 0114(0005)]
If Pokémon are in trouble, why’re we still here?! Let’s get right out there to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sorry to leave it all to you, but you’ll have to take care of the Dynamax Pokémon. I’ll search for those sword and shield weirdos in the meantime![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wishing Stars were one component of the Darkest Day... If they have that many, they could cause Pokémon to Dynamax like Eternatus did.[VAR 0114(000A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_3100

Nice timing, you lot![VAR 0114(0017)]
The stadium’s just about reached its limit! There’re simply too many Dynamax Pokémon running wild in there![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seems Wishing Star power is bein’ used for some evil purpose.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So that’s what’s caused all this? That’s a problem, all right... But before we get that sorted, we’ve got to do something about these Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0017)]
Glad we’ve got you all here now. Though we’ve already done the bulk of the work![VAR 0114(0017)]
We’re here to help, too! Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Leave it to us!
We’ll take care of this!
Especially you, Piers! The way you battled me in the Champion Cup... You really had my Dynamax Pokémon up against the wall![VAR 0114(0017)]
Things might actually go better this time if we split up our little band.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Fantastic! Looks like we’ve got ourselves together an unbeatable team![VAR 0114(0017)]
Right! Everyone, split up so we can each take down one of the Dynamax Pokémon! Let’s do it![VAR 0114(0017)]

You guys are the greatest! You really got me out of a tough spot here! I think I’d better snap a quick one to remember this victory by.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon that went wild. No need for you all to worry about that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Give me a ring if things should go to pot again.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m always happy to lend a hand if I can. The great Raihan is here for you anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Piers! You and I have got to battle again. This time, no Dynamaxing for either of us![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wishing Stars being used for evil... I assume you all are already looking into who’s behind it, right? Carry on, then. I’ll take care of things here at Hammerlocke Stadium![VAR 0114(0017)]

You all! Did you come to lend us a hand?[VAR 0114(0011)]
...Oh. You. You came to help me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Eh, somethin’ like that. How’re things lookin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We just finished getting everyone to safety, so I was about to challenge the Dynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0011)]
The people all got out... But I’m the Gym Leader... I’ll...battle the Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
Nice one! Then let’s all work together![VAR 0114(0005)]
I give you my most heartfelt thanks![VAR 0114(0011)]
That’d... That’d be brilliant, thanks![VAR 0114(0012)]
We’ve got several opponents, so we may as well take one each. I’ll be counting on you all![VAR 0114(0011)]
There are loads of ’em... I hope everyone...can take one each. Please![VAR 0114(0012)]
Here we go![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Let’s go![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 14]
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
I can’t thank you all enough. With your help, the Dynamax Pokémon have all been returned to normal.[VAR 0114(0011)]
...Th-thanks. A lot. The Pokémon have all calmed down...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll keep them safe here in the stadium, so no need to worry.[VAR 0114(0011)]
They can rest here... They...should be fine in time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. Next time I’ll be the one who saves you in your hour of need. Give me a call if you’re ever in a rough spot.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Here... My League Card.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If there are other places that need a Champion’s help, please go look after them![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Y-you can leave things here to me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll protect the peace of Stow-on-Side Stadium with all my might![VAR 0114(0011)]
...I-I’d rather you go help those who need you![VAR 0114(0012)]

Hmph. You lot.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede?! What about the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You think I, the elite Fairy-type Gym Leader, would have any kind of trouble?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right—you’re a Gym Leader now! Though I don’t know about “elite” or whatever.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Please...please don’t tell me you came here to help? First of all, you’re a bit late to be of any use, and second, I didn’t need any help.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why’d I know you’d say something like that...? We came all the way out here just to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
What an obnoxious Gym Leader. The next Gym Challenge is shapin’ up to really be somethin’.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oleana tricked and used me... From now on, only I decide how I live![VAR 0114(000C)]
And I think what I should do now is have a battle with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, I’m sorry, mate, but... this is hardly the time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t always be in such a hurry, boy. You aced my quiz, so show a little composure.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede has already quieted three Dynamax Pokémon. He’s given you the luxury of some extra time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede’s life won’t be bound by what other people say any longer. Although I certainly influenced a few of his decisions not too long ago.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that you mention it...I suppose you did.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, yeah. As expected of a wise 88-year-old granny, I guess.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But this has nothing to do with Ms. Opal. This battle’s for me! Now, don’t dillydally! Your only option is to accept![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll battle you
I understand!
My Pokémon and I have risen from the ashes... I’ll grant you a brief glimpse at how amazing we’ve become.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you for the battle. I can now accept you as the Champion.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s painful to admit, but I’ve come to realize a few of my weaknesses.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I’ll keep getting stronger. I’ll reach the pinnacle of what Fairy types can do.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now then, as the Gym Leader, I will do my duty and clean the stadium.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, that’s what I would call a perfectly pink Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
Even after losing his right to participate in the Gym Challenge, Bede still found his own way to crash the Champion Cup... Yeah, I’d say he’s a force to be reckoned with.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I get why he was chosen to be the next Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He might be unbearable at times—or really, most all the time—but he’s a fierce Trainer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He takes things seriously
He’s really strong
Yeah. Watching him battle you, it was plain to see how much work he puts into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s strong enough that even a Champion like you recognizes it, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you both are gonna keep talkin’, how ’bout I fetch you a nice cuppa?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right, right, I hear you! And I won’t be outdone by that Bede or anyone! On to the next one![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh, actually... I didn’t realize who I was talking to.[VAR 0114(0014)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s here, so everyone can relax![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was just thinking over how to handle all the Dynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
There appear to be no less than four Dynamax Pokémon. I was just going over a plan on how to handle things.[VAR 0114(0015)]
With all of you here, we can each take one of them on![VAR 0114(0014)]
With all these strong Trainers together, I’m sure we can work something out here![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let’s hurry to the pitch.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Are you all ready, then? Let’s head to the pitch![VAR 0114(0015)]

Nice work, everyone. No one’s hurt, are they?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Phew! Is everyone feeling all right?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hah...hah... Just barely![VAR 0114(0005)]
Battling a Dynamax Pokémon all on your own is pretty hard work![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hehe. I expected nothing less from you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You seem like quite the reliable Trainer, too, Hop.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Ohoho! Of course you had no problem, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You really seem like a reliable Trainer, too, Hop![VAR 0114(0015)]
I...I do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like he ain’t used to compliments. Look, he’s got a grin wider than a Meowth.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I do not! Shut your gob, Piers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled, so there’s no need for any of you to worry, all right?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled. No need for anyone to worry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s hardly a reward for what you’ve done for me, but please take a copy of my League Card.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s not much of a reward, but have a copy of my League Card.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If anything comes up, please contact me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Give me a call if anything happens![VAR 0114(0015)]
All right then. I wish you all the best of luck for the future![VAR 0114(0014)]
Don’t overdo it out there![VAR 0114(0015)]

So the reason those red and blue buffoons could make so many Pokémon Dynamax was because they hoarded up so many Wishing Stars...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We’ve got to go help all the other places where these Dynamax Pokémon are running wild![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like most of the stadiums have got this Dynamax problem sorted now. Let’s keep up the pace, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right! I think that’s all the stadiums sorted now! We didn’t miss any, did we, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]

[~ 7]
Things’ll probably get even tougher from here. We still got three more stadiums where there’s some Dynamax Pokémon runnin’ wild. Let’s up the tempo.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Looks like there’s two Pokémon Stadiums left to check.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There’s only one Pokémon Stadium with Dynamax trouble left. Let’s finish this already.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All that’s left is to catch those sword and shield weirdos.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If we don’t find them quick, they could just start all this up again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wasn’t Professor Sonia s’pposed to be lookin’ into where those two might be?[VAR 0114(0016)]
And once we find them again, I’m going to take them right down![VAR 0114(0005)]
*beep beep beep*
That’s your Rotom Phone, [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s got to be Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]? It’s me! Sonia![VAR 0114(000B)]
Heh! Called it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos got into Hammerlocke Stadium and are headed for the Energy Plant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The door to the plant’s locked, but I think I can get it open. Give me a bit, and you’ll be able to get in there![VAR 0114(000B)]
You hear that? Hammerlocke Stadium. Get over there as soon as you can![VAR 0114(000B)]
Even over the phone, Sonia sure sounds lively...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We should hurry to Hammerlocke Stadium.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’re already at Hammerlocke Stadium... The door to the Energy Plant should be right down the hall. Guess we should get goin’.[VAR 0114(0016)]

But the door’s closed with an electric lock. Opening it might take some time...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wark!
I’ll work on getting the door to the roof open. Can you take care of what’s going on in the stadiums, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha—? You’re back already? Hold on a moment! I think I’ve almost got it... Huh? That’s strange...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yamp! Yamp!
What?! It...it opened?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yamper! I should’ve known! Thanks for your help![VAR 0114(000B)]

You should be ashamed!

You said that the real heroes were Pokémon! You just carelessly changed history![VAR 0114(0068)]

Well... I could believe that you two are descendants of a Galarian king...[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! Compare the way things were to the way they are now.[VAR 0114(0068)]
That’s right! Compare the way things were to the way they are now.[VAR 0114(0069)]

To suddenly start creating heroes left and right... It’s complete rubbish![VAR 0114(0068)]
To suddenly start creating heroes left and right... It’s complete rubbish![VAR 0114(0069)]
You’re wrong! What I wrote was the truth![VAR 0114(000B)]
My hypothesis was that Zacian and Zamazenta have been protecting the Galar region since ancient times![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well then! If we are at an impasse, perhaps we should test which truth is the most truthy.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well then! If we are at an impasse, perhaps we should test which truth is the most truthy.[VAR 0114(0069)]
If things are really as you say, then even if we bombard them with Galar particles, they should remain calm and stalwart![VAR 0114(0068)]
If things are really as you say, then even if we bombard them with Galar particles, they should remain calm and stalwart![VAR 0114(0069)]
You seriously want to make the two Pokémon that saved us all run amok?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I get it... So all those sudden Dynamax Pokémon from before were just your little experiments.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hm! It seems you are indeed capable of understanding something![VAR 0114(0068)]

Oho! So you want to take the lift up?[VAR 0114(0068)]

We’ve got to get up top quick, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m counting on you to take down the ringleader![VAR 0114(0005)]
This time I shall show you the opulent Pokémon I have raised explicitly for this battle![VAR 0114(0068)]

Ah, well, it appears that my younger brother was given enough time.[VAR 0114(0068)]

I hate to admit it, but if anyone can stop it, it’s got to be you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

As expected of the Champion... You took complete control of the situation. Plus it looks like that Pokémon is waitin’ for you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Amazing... Absolutely incredible, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I wonder if [VAR 0101(0001)] is thanking you, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]

Ah, whatever...[VAR 0114(0016)]

Professor Sonia...
I can’t ask you to forgive me. But I am truly sorry for deceiving you.
I was really hurt at first, but I’ve rallied. Thanks to you, I ended up learning quite a bit... Ah, that came off a bit more sarcastic than I thought it would![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hehe... Well, please continue to do your best as a professor.
Righto! We’ve stopped them from causing any harm! Still, I hope [VAR 0101(0001)] is OK...[VAR 0114(000B)]

Hop, you’re amazing
Yeah... It does, doesn’t it? Though I can tell you, things were looking pretty dire here at first![VAR 0114(0005)]

Kuuun.
Kuuun.
What? Wait, really?! Y-you sure about this?[VAR 0114(0005)]

If you need some time to prepare, I can take you back to the entrance of the woods.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Want me to show you to the center of the woods, where Hop is waiting?[VAR 0114(000B)]

That’s our greatest Champion for you... You really are strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
But getting beat this time felt a bit different. I may’ve lost, but I feel great![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I think I’ve found a dream of my own![VAR 0114(0005)]
I want to be someone who can help out Pokémon that’re in trouble, wherever they are... I think I want to become a Pokémon Professor![VAR 0114(0005)]
I started thinking I might when we were going around to all the stadiums to help the Pokémon that were running out of control.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I know I don’t know enough about Pokémon yet, and I’ve got no experience for this sort of thing, but I’m gonna study and learn a whole lot![VAR 0114(0005)]
And someday I’ll become the sort of professor that you, [VAR 0100(0000)], and you, Sonia... well, the sort you would be proud to know![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m gonna take a different path than you and Lee are taking, [VAR 0100(0000)]...but... I’ll still always think of you as my true rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s nothing I’d like better!
I still don’t plan on losing to you!
Same here. We’ll always be rivals, you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not like I plan on losing to you, either! Even if our goals are different now... we’ll always be proper rivals, you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ahhh! No fair. You two are so young and cute.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m tearing up.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia! Getting a bit weepy in your old age, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! I’m still young and super energetic![VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, Hop. Fancy becoming my assistant at the lab?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got all the books and data on Pokémon you could ever want![VAR 0114(000B)]
Since you want to be a professor someday, I’ll oversee your studies![VAR 0114(000B)]
Then I definitely want to! Only...you sure I can really be any help to you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course! Mind you, it’ll be a lot of work. Work’s really been piling up since I lost my first assistant![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait! So what you really mean is you’re offering me the position to help yourself out? Ah, fine! I’ll still do a bang-up job![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll have my back, too—right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and...here, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You should take this![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0101(0001)] and I, well... We’re gonna do our best together to work toward achieving that dream. So until we do...you keep it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
*clap clap clap*
Well, well, well now! That certainly was a splendid battle and a refreshing back and forth, eh wot?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well now... That really touched my heart![VAR 0114(0069)]
Huh?! Sordward and Shielbert...with Piers? And even Lee?![VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you lot doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
No need for the noisemakery, young lady.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We have come to meet with the young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0069)]
They didn’t get the chance to properly apologize yet.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And I’m here to keep an eye on them. They did technically descend from the original kings of Galar, after all.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Seems you lot have been up to all sorts of things while I was stuck in Rose Tower trying to take care of the mess the chairman left behind.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You’ve no idea! Those two were forcing Pokémon to Dynamax all over the place![VAR 0114(0005)]
And for that, we are really, truly sorry. Look at our sorriness.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We thought only of ourselves and brought harm to innocent Pokémon. We have truly caused a large amount of trouble.[VAR 0114(0069)]
M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)], you helped us even though we did those awful things...[VAR 0114(0068)]
You are so worthy of the throne, you could say it’s a Dynamax-sized amount of worthiness![VAR 0114(0069)]
I already told you two... Zacian and Zamazenta are the real royalty.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Incorrect! We have abdicated the title to h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer. There are no other rulers but [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0068)]
Hmm. Now that I look closely, you absolutely do have the air of a celebrity![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, fancy that... I think you’ve grown on them, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh dear... Reluctantly, I’m afraid we two must away.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Our tour to apologize to those we’ve troubled awaits![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well then... Good-bye! Wahahahah!![VAR 0114(006A)]
Oi! Don’t go runnin’ off on your own.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
Er, what?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Just so you know, I saw your Pokémon battle against Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
You sure have gotten strong! You were so good, I nearly sent out my Charizard without thinking, wanting to join in on the fun![VAR 0114(0004)]
It seems like you’ve found your own path to walk in life, Hop.[VAR 0114(0004)]
As your older brother... No, as your rival, you have my full support![VAR 0114(0004)]
I...I do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh? Leon gave you some pretty high praise. You look like the Meowth’s got your tongue, Hop.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Awww, zip it, Sonia! I do not! Hehehe...[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I guess we should get going, too...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right! Then it’s a race to see who gets back home first![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know you haven’t reached your full potential yet, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Train and prepare as much as you like. I’ll be waiting here whenever you’re ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
Adventure across the Galar region to find many more Pokémon to battle and catch! The Battle Tower in Wyndon has opened, too! It’s filled with Trainers stronger than those you’ve faced up until now. Challenge them if you dare!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m giving it my best with my studies! It’s not easy, but it’s still great fun![VAR 0114(0005)]
If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]. Hop’s been studying pretty hard, surprisingly. I’m sure he’d be glad to know you dropped by for a visit.[VAR 0114(000B)]

The strongest Dragon-type move is called Draco Meteor. Do you want me to teach the move to your Pokémon?
I understand... Moves that are too strong can be difficult to use.
It looks like your Pokémon can learn my move, but there’s one condition that needs to be met. That is...the Pokémon has to be completely friendly toward you. I can teach the move only after the Pokémon becomes totally bonded with you.
None of the Pokémon you are with right now can learn this move... Come back when you obtain a Pokémon that can learn this move!
Then please select the Pokémon that will learn this move.
Oh, this Pokémon can’t learn this move.
Oh, this is an Egg. It can’t learn this move or any move.
Oh, this Pokémon already knows Draco Meteor.
Draco Meteor is indeed the strongest Dragon-type move. However, using it harshly lowers the user’s Sp. Atk stat.
Choose a move that will be replaced with [VAR 0107(0000)].

Aha, there you are![VAR 0114(0042)]
Hm... You’re the traveler I’m supposed to guide, am I right?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Right on time, too! You’re pretty punctual for a kid![VAR 0114(0042)]
Exactly when we agreed to meet, too. Quite the commendable punctuality.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Hmmm... Hey, have we met before or something? Oh, it doesn’t really matter, I guess![VAR 0114(0042)]
Hm? I’ve got the strangest feeling we’ve met before... But I can’t recall. And here I thought Amnesia was Slowpoke’s move.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m Klara! I’ve been at the dojo awhile, so they sent me to help out the newbie![VAR 0114(0071)]
My name is Avery. I’m a senior member of the dojo you are to join.[VAR 0114(0072)]
What dojo?
I think you’ve got the wrong person...
Oh, come on! I know you’re the new student who’s supposed to join the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0071)]
You’re here to join the Master Dojo, are you not? I also train there.[VAR 0114(0072)]
What’s going on? Am I being mocked...by a kid?! But I’m the colorful, caring, and charismatic Klara![VAR 0114(0071)]
My goodness, this is a thick one. Like a poor, lost Wooloo... It’s up to me—as an elegant adult—to make sure they get the message.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well then... How about we have a quick battle? Just so, y’know, we can see who’s better?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Perhaps a show of strength is the best way to get to know each other.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ll be waiting outside, so come on out when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0071)]
I’ll await you outside. Once you’re ready, come out to face me.[VAR 0114(0072)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’ll never know what hit h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Time to show h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer who the better Trainer is...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’m supposed to join the dojo on this island today, but... there’s a strange person standing outside the station, and I’m a bit scared to head out...
Was that a person from the dojo? ...Maybe I’ll pass on joining. Hey, why don’t you join instead?

Hee hee! I bet this is your first time on the Isle of Armor.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hm. Is this your first visit to the Isle of Armor?[VAR 0114(0072)]
I bet you can’t wait to start exploring, but first things first! We need to make sure you’re ready![VAR 0114(0071)]
You would no doubt like to run around and explore freely, but first, let’s make sure you can handle yourself.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Since I’ve already been at the Master Dojo for a little while now...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Naturally, as a member of the Master Dojo...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ll be the one testing you out! Go easy on me, OK?[VAR 0114(0071)]
I’ll be using my psychic powers to test your strength! Come now... Don’t overexert yourself![VAR 0114(0072)]
Huh?! No no no! NO no no! Th-there must be some mistake![VAR 0114(0071)]
Ah, um... Could...could you give me a moment?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Not good... Not good at all, man... How’d this kid get so strong?![VAR 0114(0071)]
Improbable... No, impossible! What kind of Trick did this kid use?[VAR 0114(0072)]
If this kid joins the dojo, nobody’s gonna pay attention to my strength...[VAR 0114(0071)]
If a Trainer of this talent arrives at the dojo, then the people there very well may suffer Amnesia about my very existence![VAR 0114(0072)]
I could just tell h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to buzz off... No, they asked me to bring in the new student![VAR 0114(0071)]
If only I could get rid of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer... But I’ve been tasked with escorting h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to the dojo...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Ahem![VAR 0114(0071)]
Ahem![VAR 0114(0072)]
Hey, that wasn’t bad! I mean, it’s not like I was going all out—not at all—but still![VAR 0114(0071)]
You have potential. Why, you made me use a whole three percent of my strength![VAR 0114(0072)]
Buuut...you see...our dojo is one that’s got a long-standing reputation! Even the famous Champion Leon trained at our place![VAR 0114(0071)]
Still... How shall I put this... Our dojo is a respected place, where even the famous Champion Leon trained.[VAR 0114(0072)]
No offense, but maybe, just maybe, you’re not quiiite good enough to make it?[VAR 0114(0071)]
What I’m trying to say is, I don’t think you’re quite up to snuff...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Sooo...how about this? Why not enjoy the sights, but just stay away from the Master Dojo over there, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Therefore! I suggest you ignore the Master Dojo standing over there and head home as soon as you’re done seeing the sights![VAR 0114(0072)]
Here, I’ll even give you this! Y’know, as a souvenir![VAR 0114(0071)]
I suppose you can have this, too, as a parting gift.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Just show it when you visit a boutique or a hair salon, and they’ll let you buy stuff that’s not available to most people![VAR 0114(0071)]
Show it when you next visit a boutique or hair salon, and I’m sure you’ll be able to find some more-elegant garb, like mine.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Anyway...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I guess that’s that! See you never! Hee hee hee![VAR 0114(0071)]
Farewell! I doubt I’ll see you again. Avery, Teleport![VAR 0114(0072)]

Oh, fiddlesticks... So our new student decided to go back home?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Seems that way, yep! I did my best to welcome h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, but...[VAR 0114(0071)]
It would appear so. I’ll have you know, my offer to escort them was perfect.[VAR 0114(0072)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she just suddenly left after our battle...[VAR 0114(0071)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe rather abruptly absconded after our battle...[VAR 0114(0072)]
And I’d been hoping we’d get to welcome a new member to our little family here, too...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, hello? And who are you, love?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmm?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Agh![VAR 0114(0071)]
Gah![VAR 0114(0072)]
Of course! You must be the new student that’s supposed to join the dojo today![VAR 0114(0042)]
Uh, sure...?
You’ve got the wrong person
Right, right, right, right! Exactly, ma’am! I swear! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe must’ve changed h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser mind about joining the dojo![VAR 0114(0071)]
Yes, right! That’s correct, ma’am! I swear, I thought you had used Teleport or something, you disappeared so quickly![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh, but here you are! I’m sooo happy you decided to come after all![VAR 0114(0071)]
Regardless! It gives me great joy to know that you decided to come after all![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh, everything’s just coming up roses! Now, I’m quite sure they already told me your name, but...[VAR 0114(0042)]
It’s [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Uh, [VAR 0100(0000)]...
That’s right! You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]! Of course you are, love.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Though I’m rather sure that’s NOT the name I was told before...[VAR 0114(0042)]
My name’s Honey. I help keep this place running.[VAR 0114(0074)]
You can consider me the lady of the house. Not that the Master Dojo is just any old house![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aaaagh! Why?! How?! What does [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she think [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s doing, just showing up like that?![VAR 0114(0071)]
Bagh! Why? For what purpose is [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she here?! My Future Sight must be off![VAR 0114(0072)]
This ain’t good... Ms. Honey will know that I lied![VAR 0114(0071)]
I must think... Before Ms. Honey figures out I told an innocent little lie...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Seems you’ve already met our Klara. Bit of an odd Ducklett, but she’s one of our own![VAR 0114(0074)]
Seems you’ve already met our Avery. Bit of an odd Ducklett, but he’s one of our own![VAR 0114(0074)]

Heh, it’s an honor to make your acquaintance.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh dear, but look at me![VAR 0114(0074)]
Here I am making you stand around outside after you’ve come all this way![VAR 0114(0074)]
Come in, come in! Don’t mind the faint stench of sweat![VAR 0114(0074)]
Listen, you... If you dare tell Ms. Honey about what happened at the station...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Now, listen... If you dare breathe a word of what happened at the station to Ms. Honey...[VAR 0114(0072)]

Everybody, I have an announcement to make! We’ve got a new student joining us today![VAR 0114(0074)]
Please welcome [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m sure you’ll all have lots to teach h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hi-yah! Welcome to the dojo!
All our students are so good and hardworking. Everyone really gives it their all around here.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Now here’s someone who’s not listed in my database of students...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Hello, sweetie pie! It’s not usual for you to bother greeting a newcomer![VAR 0114(0074)]
This is Hyde—my darling only son.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Are you some kind of outlier? Here, you should give this a try.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But don’t open it, OK? It’s got tech I developed inside, and I don’t want you to go and ruin it.[VAR 0114(0075)]
He’s so good with his hands, always making something new. Such a clever boy.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And that handsome gent in the back is my darling hubby and the very master of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Why, hello there! My name is Mustard! I’m rather good at Pokémon battles, you know![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m pleased as cheese that you could join us![VAR 0114(0073)]
Nice to...meet you?
Cheesed to meet you!
Heh heh, such a polite student! You seem to be the hardworking type, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh, I see you’ve got a sense of humor, too! Good, good![VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
Don’t let him fool you into thinking he’s just a silly old man. He’s a real beast when he gets serious.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, darling, I’ll leave the rest up to you![VAR 0114(0074)]
Yaaay! This is my favorite part! I wanna see just how good you are![VAR 0114(0073)]
So, why not have a battle with little old me?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Just say the word when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
Aww! But I want to battle Master Mustard, too!
A quick recording of progress before a battle is the first step to a safe adventure! Hi-yah!
A lot of people hear the word dojo and think of a strict, serious place, but the Master Dojo is a lot of fun! Ms. Honey’s food is excellent, too!
I’d very much like to see what your battle style is!
The master’s a kind man. Don’t be afraid to show him everything you’ve got!
I got an Exp. Charm from Hyde, too! Just keep it in your Bag, and it’ll boost the Exp. Points your Pokémon earn!
I know I’m not wearing the dojo uniform, but I’m a student, too! They didn’t have my size!
The Master Dojo’s a strange dojo, if you ask me. We have all sorts of odd training routines, like cleaning up or even taking naps!
You...you have the scent of a powerful Trainer...
Nice to meet you!
If there’s anything you want to know about the dojo, don’t hesitate to ask somebody else![VAR 0114(0071)]
You can always call if you run into any trouble. Call somebody else, that is.[VAR 0114(0072)]
You must be tired after that trek from the station.[VAR 0114(0074)]
If you and your Pokémon ever need to rest up, feel free to use that room right there.[VAR 0114(0074)]

Yaaahooo! Are you ready for a battle?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh my, you like to take your time, don’t you? Don’t keep this old man waiting too long![VAR 0114(0073)]
All right! Let’s get this show started! This is the best way to get to know new students![VAR 0114(0073)]
Bah ha ha! I lost! You’re pretty strong, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Hey, the newbie won! Master wasn’t going all out, but that’s still pretty impressive!
Who is that kid, anyway?
The way you battle really shows me how much you care about your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0073)]
Even if you’ve come because of a misunderstanding, as long as you have a will to learn...[VAR 0114(0073)]
then you’re welcome at the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
I think we can all help each other become stronger! I’m happy you’ve come to join us![VAR 0114(0073)]
So on that note, here’s your Dojo Uniform![VAR 0114(0073)]
With that on, you’ll fit right in with the students of my Master Dojo.[VAR 0114(0073)]
You got a [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Hey, newbie!
If you want to change or just take a break, use that room over there!
Now then![VAR 0114(0073)]
With [VAR 0100(0000)] here now, the dojo’s at max capacity![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s time to really start our training! You’ll all be facing [VAR FF00(0006)]three trials[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0073)]
Three trials?!
Wait. Why is there a max capacity for this dojo?
And there’s more! The person who completes the three trials will receive the [VAR FF00(0006)]secret armor[VAR FF00(0000)] of this dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
Ooh! A secret set of armor! I want it!
Heh heh, that’s the spirit! Now, lemme explain the first trial...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Aww! But, Masterrr! You haven’t given me my uniform yet![VAR 0114(0071)]
Pardon me, Master! I haven’t received my uniform yet![VAR 0114(0072)]
Why does that kid get a uniform but not me?! It’s not fair![VAR 0114(0071)]
I daresay it’s unfair for only that child to get a uniform. Unequal, even! I demand an item swap![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh dear. Do you really not have a uniform? My bad, my bad![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s easy to fix, though! I have another uniform right here for you, Klara![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s easy to fix, though! I have another uniform right here for you, Avery![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hee hee! The squeaky wheel gets the grease![VAR 0114(0071)]
Ha! It does pay to complain sometimes![VAR 0114(0072)]
Klara got a Dojo Unif—
Avery got a Dojo Unif—
POKE![VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh?! What was that?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Eek! What in the world?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Wha—?! It’s gone! Where’d my Dojo Uniform go?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hey! My Dojo Uniform! It’s gone missing![VAR 0114(0072)]
Po-po-po...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmm?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Poke!
That speed... Was it really these Slowpoke?
I’ve never seen any Slowpoke move so fast!
Hey! Give it back! Give me my Dojo Uniform![VAR 0114(0071)]
How dare you? Are you using Trick?! Return my Dojo Uniform immediately![VAR 0114(0072)]
Slooow? Slooow...
... ... ...
Poooke!
Hey! Get back here![VAR 0114(0071)]
Oh my! Where do you think you’re going?![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oops! Guess I let them out of their Poké Balls a little too soon! Heh heh heh![VAR 0114(0073)]
Master... What’s up with those Slowpoke?
This is the first trial, my students...[VAR 0114(0073)]
You’ve all gotta chase after those fast Slowpoke, trained with care by little old me! But that’s not all... You need to defeat them, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
And while you’re at it, could you get Klara’s Dojo Uniform back?[VAR 0114(0073)]
And while you’re at it, could you get Avery’s Dojo Uniform back?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Awww! Do we have to?!
Well, that’s that! Do your best, you lot![VAR 0114(0073)]
Do you want to change back into your usual clothes?
All set! Time to chase down those fast Slowpoke!
No need to change! Time to chase down those fast Slowpoke!
The first trial is to chase down the three fast Slowpoke! And while you’re at it, it would be cool if you could get back the Dojo Uniform they stole![VAR 0114(0073)]
Slowpoke are usually super zoned out, but that didn’t stop the master from raising them to be super fast!
The way they moved... Those aren’t ordinary Slowpoke! Maybe they wanted to wear the Dojo Uniform?
I know you might be feeling nervous, being new here and all. But don’t you worry. All our students are good, through and through. They’ll take care of you.[VAR 0114(0074)]

You took back all of Avery’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]! You should go tell Master Mustard!
Only two of those fast Slowpoke left!
Only one of those fast Slowpoke left!
These fast Slowpoke prefer wide open spaces. You won’t see them going into forests!
The fast Slowpoke aren’t too great at swimming. They couldn’t cross that river. Look around the wetlands—they probably didn’t go farther than that!
I checked every nook and cranny of that cave, but I didn’t find a single fast Slowpoke.
*huff huff* I’ve been running so long my legs feel like they’re gonna fall off. If I had a bike, it’d be so much easier to catch these fast Slowpoke.

Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Welcome back![VAR 0114(0074)]
You... Don’t tell me you got my uniform back all on your own![VAR 0114(0071)]
You... Were you able to reclaim my uniform all all by yourself?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Here you go!
You can have it back
You gave the [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] to Klara.
You gave the [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] to Avery.
Oh... Well, uh, thanks.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmph! You have my thanks.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well mustered, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
You cleared the first trial like it was nothing![VAR 0114(0073)]
Why, I think this is the first time since Leon that someone was able to handle all three fast Slowpoke on their own![VAR 0114(0073)]
The rest of you tried very hard, too! You were able to catch up to the Slowpoke, but I guess you couldn’t defeat them.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Uuugh...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Tch...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Tell you what. Anyone who was able to catch up to a Slowpoke at least once gets a pass![VAR 0114(0073)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] really outdid h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imerself, so it’s only fair everyone else gets another chance. Try to make a comeback, everybody![VAR 0114(0073)]
Ooh! How generous!
*sigh* Either way, I’m still out.
Oh, that reminds me. Honey, where are those little ones?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, that’s right, darling! I had nearly forgotten...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Squirtle! Bulbasaur! Come on in, sweeties![VAR 0114(0074)]
Driiip.
Viiine.
These are our sweet little Pokémon, Bulbasaur and Squirtle. We’ve all been taking care of them together. And I’d say they’re more than a little curious about your strength as a Trainer.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Why don’t you pick one to keep for yourself? You did succeed in the trial, after all![VAR 0114(0074)]
And just so you know, these two have been raised in a very special way. When they evolve, they’ll be able to Gigantamax![VAR 0114(0074)]
Both Bulbasaur and Squirtle will have the power to Gigantamax eventually. It’s a tough decision, isn’t it? Give it a good think before you choose one![VAR 0114(0074)]
You did great, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Don’t get a big head just ’cause you did well![VAR 0114(0071)]
Don’t go getting all uppity from one trifling success...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I tracked down a Slowpoke, but I was no match for its speed...
You’re still new, but you’re doing great! I think I’ll call you “Ace Newbie”!
I just barely made it. I’m so relieved...
The purpose of that last trial was to learn to be able to read a Pokémon’s movements.
Squirtle and Bulbasaur are rare Pokémon that live in the Kanto region.
The master’s training is always very strange.
Tsk! I couldn’t clear the trial. Looks like I’m not getting that secret armor, but I can still do some training while I’m here to toughen up.
If only I’d had a bike... Those fast Slowpoke sure are, well...fast!
I had a feeling you were a strong one. I’d like to test my skills against you sometime.
My legs are positively sore from running all over the place.

Waaah!
Viiig!
So you’re going to go with our little Squirtle? It’s great with Water-type moves![VAR 0114(0074)]
So you’re going to go with our sweet Bulbasaur? It’s first-rate with Grass-type moves![VAR 0114(0074)]
Heehee! It’s so hard to choose just one, isn’t it? Take your time to think it over, love.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Squirt!
Bulba!
Squirtle became your Pokémon!
Bulbasaur became your Pokémon!
Squirtle looks pleased as punch that you chose it![VAR 0114(0074)]
Bulbasaur looks pleased as punch that you chose it![VAR 0114(0074)]
And don’t you worry, Bulbasaur. I’ll be sure to raise you with lots of love.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And don’t you worry, Squirtle. I’ll be sure to raise you with lots of love.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make you oh-so-strong, so you’ll never lose to [VAR 0101(0001)]. Teehee![VAR 0114(0074)]
Bulba?
Squirt?
Ms. Honey! If you want that Pokémon to learn [VAR FF00(0006)]new moves[VAR FF00(0000)], you can leave that to me!
[~ 17]
Well, aren’t you just the sweetest thing![VAR 0114(0074)]
That lovely lad is always so kind. Give him a bit of Armorite Ore, and he’ll teach your darling new Pokémon a new move. You should give it a try.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Remember that your new Pokémon will be able to Gigantamax once it has fully evolved. So be sure to raise it well![VAR 0114(0074)]
Dynamaxing... A mysterious phenomenon unique to Pokémon of Galar...[VAR 0114(0073)]
And then there’s Gigantamaxing, a very special way of Dynamaxing for very special Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Their moves change, of course, but their appearances change, too.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Speaking of Gigantamax, there’s that secret recipe of the Master Dojo! Drinking it makes you [VAR FF00(0006)]gigantic and strong[VAR FF00(0000)]! I call it [VAR FF00(0006)]Max Soup[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’d love to have a bowl of Max Soup full of [VAR FF00(0006)]Max Mushrooms[VAR FF00(0000)] right about now. It sure has been a while...[VAR 0114(0073)]
And that’s why your second trial shall be mushroom picking![VAR 0114(0073)]
Max Mushrooms are the key to Gigantamaxing, and I’m tasking you with finding three![VAR 0114(0073)]
Max Mushrooms are [VAR FF00(0006)]red with a spiral pattern[VAR FF00(0000)]. I’m pretty sure they grow in dark, humid places![VAR 0114(0073)]
And with that, your next trial begins! I’m countin’ on ya![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh... Whoooa!
Sorry, not sorry, but I haven’t accepted you as the hotshot everyone else seems to think you are.[VAR 0114(0071)]
You’d better think again if you think I’m gonna let you finish this trial before me, mate...[VAR 0114(0071)]
It would seem that I am fated not to accept your capabilities as of yet...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I will obtain the Max Mushrooms first and claim victory with my own two hands![VAR 0114(0072)]
Your second trial is picking three Max Mushrooms! Max Mushrooms are red with a spiral pattern. I’m pretty sure they grow in dark, humid places![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’re going to be doing some training by ourselves!
I wonder if Max Mushrooms grow in the Forest of Focus. Or maybe in the cave just past the forest?
Hm? I’ll stay back and watch things from here. I failed the Slowpoke trial, after all.
Good luck out there! Thinking about Max Mushrooms gets me hungry... Uh, I mean—I’ll be here cheering for you!
I’m going to take good care of that cute little Bulbasaur. Raise your Squirtle well![VAR 0114(0074)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! My bad, my bad![VAR 0114(0073)]
It just dawned on me that you’re brand-new to the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0073)]
I bet you have no idea where to even begin looking for Max Mushrooms![VAR 0114(0073)]
C’mon—let’s go for a walk, and I’ll show you some mushroom hot spots.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Dum dum dee dee... La la de daaa...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Now, usually the Forest of Focus is chock-full of Max Mushrooms.[VAR 0114(0073)]
But the thing is, a swarm of Greedent came through and ate every last one here![VAR 0114(0073)]
So I’m thinking maybe you’ll have more luck finding Max Mushrooms if you go check [VAR FF00(0006)]Warm-Up Tunnel[VAR FF00(0000)]. It’s out on the other side of the forest![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just watch where you’re going in the forest, ’K? It’s easy to get lost![VAR 0114(0073)]
Anyhoo... Good luck with the hunt for Max Mushrooms! Catch you back at the dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hey, Max Mushrooms! Oh, it’s only you, [VAR 0100(0000)]... Sheesh! Don’t confuse me like that!
I’ve searched the Forest of Focus high and low, but there’s no sign of any Max Mushrooms... Could they be growing somewhere else?
Blast! I’ve gotten disoriented! Warm-Up Tunnel isn’t this way!
I don’t think there are any Max Mushrooms this way. I need to hone my sense of direction!
I want to get to the Training Lowlands, but this isn’t the right way to go...
If I brought back Foongus instead of Max Mushrooms, d’you think they’d notice?

Some wild Max Mushrooms! Do you want to pick them?
Hold up a sec![VAR 0114(0042)]
Wait just one moment![VAR 0114(0042)]
*wheeze*... *wheeze*...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*pant*... *pant*...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Hellooo, what’s this?! Three Max Mushrooms in one spot? Here I thought I’d need to go find them one by one![VAR 0114(0071)]
Hah! Just as I expected! Multiple Max Mushrooms growing in a bunch![VAR 0114(0072)]
I saw those mushrooms first! I swear![VAR 0114(0071)]
My psychic powers picked up on these Max Mushrooms eons before you found them.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ve been at the dojo longer and all. Sooo... it’s only fair that you let me have ’em. Riiight?[VAR 0114(0071)]
I believe I should be the one to get those Max Mushrooms. First come, first served, and all![VAR 0114(0072)]
No way!
Sure, you can have them!
Tsk! Yeah, I figured that’s what you’d say...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmph! I knew you wouldn’t listen to reason.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Waaait... What’s this now? Are you givin’ me attitude? Pityin’ me, are you?![VAR 0114(0071)]
What’s this? Are you trying to show you’re stronger than me? How distasteful![VAR 0114(0072)]
Gosh, you’re a pain in the neck... You just show up outta nowhere, and just happen to be young and talented...[VAR 0114(0071)]
I find your presence most disturbing! You show up at the dojo unannounced and go on to show such talent, even though you’re still so young...[VAR 0114(0072)]
If you’re looking to get in my way, well, I think some vile poisons will take care of that![VAR 0114(0071)]
You dare get in my way? I warned you about my psychic powers, and now you’ll experience them firsthand![VAR 0114(0072)]
Aaagh! Why can’t I win?! I’m trying as hard as I can! What am I missing?![VAR 0114(0071)]
Blast it. Victory still eludes me... What is it that I lack? What do I need?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Fine, you can have those silly mushrooms! I’m going to find better ones, anyway![VAR 0114(0071)]
Very well, you can have those ones. I’ll go and find myself some Max Mushrooms that are far more elegant![VAR 0114(0072)]
So there! Nyah![VAR 0114(0071)]
Avery, Teleport![VAR 0114(0072)]

Hello, hello? Is this [VAR 0100(0000)]’s phone? How’s the trial coming along, love?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Easy peasy!
I’m managing somehow!
You mean you’ve already managed to find three Max Mushrooms?![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ve been checking in on everybody’s progress, but it seems you’re in first place once again![VAR 0114(0074)]
You really are our new rising star, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I suppose I’d better go put the pot on the stove, but you be careful on your way back! Ciao![VAR 0114(0074)]

Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Welcome back! Looks like you nailed the trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
Congrats on finding the Max Mushrooms! Trial number two was no problem for you![VAR 0114(0073)]
All my other students ended up getting lost in the forest...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Turns out finding Max Mushrooms was the least of their problems![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s a shame, but I guess everyone other than [VAR 0100(0000)] will fail the trial...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Well, first things first—a proper meal! Let’s have the Max Mushrooms made into a delicious Max Soup, shall we?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Mmm, mmm, mmm! I’ve really outdone myself this time![VAR 0114(0074)]
Now all that’s left to add are those lovely Max Mushrooms you’ve brought us![VAR 0114(0074)]
*gasp*... *pant*... Ms. Honey! Please wait...[VAR 0114(0071)]
M-Ms. Honey...I beg you! W-wait just one moment...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Why, Klara![VAR 0114(0074)]
Why, Avery![VAR 0114(0074)]
What in the world has gotten into you! I’ve never seen you in such a flutter...[VAR 0114(0074)]
*pant*... *pant*...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*pant*... *pant*...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I...I’ve got some Max Mushrooms, too![VAR 0114(0071)]
I...I’ve also obtained some Max Mushrooms![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oho! Nice work, Klara! You must’ve searched hard for those![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oho! Nice work, Avery! You must’ve searched hard for those![VAR 0114(0073)]
That makes you the second person to pass the second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
That makes you the second person to pass the second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
Waaaaaah! I did it! I did it! *sob* *sniff*...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*sniff*... I did it... Y-yes, I did search rather hard...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Aww, chin up, darling Klara! You did it! This is a cause for celebration![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aww, chin up, darling Avery! You did it! This is a cause for celebration![VAR 0114(0074)]
Master, Ms. Honey...please, can I ask for something, just this once?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Master, Ms. Honey...if you could grant me one wish, just this once, I would be indebted.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I want you to use my Max Mushrooms in the Max Soup![VAR 0114(0071)]
Would you be so kind as to use my Max Mushrooms in the Max Soup?[VAR 0114(0072)]
I really want to share my hard work with everybody here![VAR 0114(0071)]
I feel that everyone here should enjoy the taste of my efforts...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh, Klara...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, Avery...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well! If that’s all you’re after... then I’m perfectly happy to oblige![VAR 0114(0074)]
Though this is hardly the first time you’ve asked for something, and I rather doubt it’ll be the last.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Though this is hardly the first time you’ve asked for something, and I rather doubt it’ll be the last.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Ms. Honey...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Ms. Honey.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I hope you don’t feel that your thunder’s being stolen, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0074)]
But we’re a family here, and families share! So... we’ll go ahead and use Klara’s mushrooms today![VAR 0114(0074)]
But we’re a family here, and families share! So... we’ll go ahead and use Avery’s mushrooms today![VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s just so rare for her to try hard at something. I really want to reward that. You understand, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s just so rare for him to try hard at something. I really want to reward that. You understand, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
You can hold on to the Max Mushrooms you found. I’m sure you’ll find a good use for them![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh...and don’t worry! You still totally passed the trial with flying colors![VAR 0114(0073)]
Think of those Max Mushrooms as an extra reward.[VAR 0114(0073)]
All right, everybody! Soup’s on![VAR 0114(0074)]
The famous Max Soup of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
Well...I’m famished! Time to dig in![VAR 0114(0073)]
Let’s eat!
You enjoyed the Max Soup...
Oh, I never did explain the big deal about this soup, did I?[VAR 0114(0073)]
You see, when one drinks this dojo’s famous Max Soup...[VAR 0114(0073)]
You feel Dynamax energy welling up from inside you?!
No, you don’t... That kind of thing doesn’t happen if a human has the soup.[VAR 0114(0073)]
But! Things are a bit different when certain Pokémon drink the soup![VAR 0114(0073)]
You see, there are some Pokémon that have distinct potential...[VAR 0114(0073)]
and when they drink the soup, their Dynamax form will change into a Gigantamax form![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’ll keep one of our lads in the kitchen on soup duty from now on, too.[VAR 0114(0074)]
So you can ask him to serve up a fresh bowl of Max Soup whenever you need![VAR 0114(0074)]
Now then, let’s wrap things up![VAR 0114(0073)]
You all did your best on the second trial, and I’m proud of everyone here![VAR 0114(0073)]
And last but not least...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Thanks for the soup, Honey![VAR 0114(0073)]
Thanks for the soup, Ms. Honey!
By the way, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Meet me in my room when you have a moment.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Hmmm? Did the master call for you, too?[VAR 0114(0071)]
What’s this? Are you here because the master summoned you, too?[VAR 0114(0072)]
I spent the whole time being chased around the Forest of Focus by a Venipede...
You just joined the dojo, and yet you’ve already completed two of the trials! I’d expect nothing less from a talent that Klara brought into the fold!
You just joined the dojo, and yet you’ve already completed two of the trials! I’d expect nothing less from a talent that Avery brought into the fold!
I hear something amazing happens if you feed a cluster of Max Mushrooms to a Pokémon during a battle.
Having us compete and fight over the limited number of Max Mushrooms... That trial’s pretty brutal when you stop and think about it...
I’m glad I wasn’t selected for soup duty!
Master’s summoned you, right? You should go see what he wants!
Chasing after Slowpoke...and then hunting down mushrooms... What could the final trial be?
Congratulations on completing the trial!
Only two completed the trial—Klara and you... I hear the footsteps of an approaching showdown!
Only two completed the trial—Avery and you... I hear the footsteps of an approaching showdown!
That Max Soup was something else!
Don’t worry—the kid on soup duty knows what he’s doing. I made sure I taught him well![VAR 0114(0074)]

There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)], Klara. Thanks for coming![VAR 0114(0073)]
There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)], Avery. Thanks for coming![VAR 0114(0073)]
Sooo...what’s this all about, Master? What did you want to tell us?[VAR 0114(0071)]
When I heard you had something to tell me, I came as soon as I could, Master.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Right! Well, I’ve decided that you two...[VAR 0114(0073)]
will now take the Master Dojo’s...[VAR 0114(0073)]
final...last...ultimate...third trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
The final...last...ultimate...third trial?![VAR 0114(0071)]
A final...last...ultimate...third trial, you say?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Final?
Last?
Ultimate?
Third trial?
What’s that?
Uh...so basically this is the last trial?[VAR 0114(0071)]
So are you saying that this would be the last trial?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Ah, well, yes. That’s the gist of it.[VAR 0114(0073)]
You two are the only ones who successfully finished the second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
You two are the only ones who successfully finished the second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’ve pushed each other to greater heights and helped each other grow.[VAR 0114(0073)]
So I’d say it’s time to finally see who is stronger... in a Dynamax Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’re going to battle? That’s the last trial?[VAR 0114(0071)]
We are to battle one another? That is the last trial?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Yep! The rules are simple. Whoever wins will complete the trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
The winner will be granted the [VAR FF00(0006)]secret armor[VAR FF00(0000)] of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
This is it... Finally...[VAR 0114(0071)]
This is it... At last...[VAR 0114(0072)]
But can I...?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Can I really...?[VAR 0114(0072)]
The battle will be held in the Battle Court behind the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
The court is a Power Spot, so you can Dynamax to your heart’s content.[VAR 0114(0073)]
I-I’ve gotta get going![VAR 0114(0071)]
I-I must make haste![VAR 0114(0072)]
I need to go there right away to prepare my pure heart for this![VAR 0114(0071)]
I must make for the Battle Court, posthaste! I must meditate on my upcoming victory![VAR 0114(0072)]
I’m going on ahead, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
A good day to you, then. I’ll be on my way.[VAR 0114(0072)]
You can laze about like a Slowpoke and take as much time as you need![VAR 0114(0071)]
Feel free to take it easy like a Slowpoke, and take all the time you need to get ready![VAR 0114(0072)]
...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Klara... She’s got talent—that’s for sure—but it’s caused her to slack off.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Avery... He’s got talent—that’s for sure—but it’s caused him to slack off.[VAR 0114(0073)]
She’s never felt the need to try hard at anything, I guess.[VAR 0114(0073)]

Remember—head to the Battle Court behind the dojo when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
Only one more trial, and you’ll get the secret armor!
Hee hee. Klara seems positively bursting with energy, doesn’t she?
Hee hee. Avery seems positively bursting with energy, doesn’t he?
The Battle Court is through the door in the dojo!
A battle with Klara... You should stay on your guard.
A battle with Avery... You should stay on your guard.
Fellow students settling their rivalry in a battle! Which side should I cheer on?
Good luck on your last trial. Everyone will be cheering you on!
Klara ran toward the Battle Court like she had something really important to do.
Avery ran toward the Battle Court like he had something really important to do.
All right! This is my chance to see Dynamax Pokémon up close!
Hehehe... Finally time for a proper battle... If we’d been doing this kind of training from the start, I would’ve made it to the final trial.
Wow! A one-on-one battle with Klara? How exciting!
Wow! A one-on-one battle with Avery? How exciting!
In battles, there’s always a winner, which means there’s always got to be a loser, too... Oh? Sorry. Don’t mind me! Just talking to myself![VAR 0114(0074)]

Looks like the two of you are ready.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Good luck!
I’m cheering for both of you![VAR 0114(0074)]
All right, you two, take your places![VAR 0114(0073)]
The Master Dojo’s final trial...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
Aaaaaand go![VAR 0114(0073)]
The victor has been decided![VAR 0114(0073)]
The one to complete the third trial is... you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hooray! Hooray!
That was amazing!
What a fierce battle!
Oh, well done! You both gave it your all![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aw man... I totally lost...[VAR 0114(0071)]
It appears...I have lost.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Hah, well, this stinks. I do everything—even cheat a little—and still lose.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Heh, how pathetic. I lost even though I resorted to such underhanded tactics.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I don’t expect a young, talented kid like you to really get it, but...[VAR 0114(0071)]
I don’t think young, capable children like you can understand how I feel.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I...really was trying, you know? As hard as I could...[VAR 0114(0071)]
I am just an average man who gave everything he possibly could...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Maybe it’s time for me to just give up on my dream of being a Gym Leader...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Perhaps it’s time I stopped playing around and gave up my dream of being a Gym Leader...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Once they find out what I did, I’ll be expelled from the dojo anyway.[VAR 0114(0071)]
After the less-than-reputable things I did, I’m likely to be expelled from the dojo.[VAR 0114(0072)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you can tell the master that I cheated.[VAR 0114(0071)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you are free to tell the master about the awful things I did.[VAR 0114(0072)]
OK
I won’t
I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Sorry for what I did...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Huh? B-but why? It was supposed to be a fair battle, and I cheated just so I could win...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Wh-what are you saying? But I turned to the shadows like a Dark type to try to win![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh, no need to tell me... You can’t hide anything from little old me![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s your strength, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Kindness toward both your Pokémon and your rivals![VAR 0114(0073)]
M-Master?![VAR 0114(0071)]
M-Master?![VAR 0114(0072)]
I should apologize on Klara’s behalf, too, as her master.[VAR 0114(0073)]
I should apologize on Avery’s behalf, too, as his master.[VAR 0114(0073)]
What she did was wrong, but...[VAR 0114(0073)]
What he did was wrong, but...[VAR 0114(0073)]
she just didn’t want to be beaten by her rival— that’s all. She’s a good, hardworking student.[VAR 0114(0073)]
he just didn’t want to be beaten by his rival— that’s all. He’s a good, hardworking student.[VAR 0114(0073)]

*sniff* Master...I thank you... You have my apologies, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0072)]
As for your punishment, Klara, you’re going to look after the Pokémon in the dojo for six months...by yourself![VAR 0114(0073)]
As for your punishment, Avery, you’re going to look after the Pokémon in the dojo for six months...by yourself![VAR 0114(0073)]
What?! I mean, yeah, that’s a lot of work, but... is that all?![VAR 0114(0071)]
What?! Is that all I have to do? And you’ll forgive me?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Of course! Let’s work on strengthening your heart![VAR 0114(0073)]
O-OK![VAR 0114(0071)]
O-OK![VAR 0114(0072)]
All right, everyone! Things are settled here![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m so proud of you both! You mustered so much effort and tried so hard![VAR 0114(0074)]
I got so teared up that I couldn’t even see half the battle, but what I saw was amazing![VAR 0114(0074)]
So moving!
I’m tearing up!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
You gave it your best and triumphed, even when faced with an unfair challenge.[VAR 0114(0073)]
To you, who has completed all the trials...[VAR 0114(0073)]
I grant the secret armor of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’ll take some time to prepare, so I’ll go ahead and get things sorted.[VAR 0114(0073)]
And that’s all, gang! As you were![VAR 0114(0073)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0071)]
Pardon me. Um...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Um! I... Well...[VAR 0114(0071)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I...[VAR 0114(0072)]
You’re...really strong![VAR 0114(0071)]
I will admit to acknowledging your strength just a little.[VAR 0114(0072)]
H-hey! Don’t just ignore me![VAR 0114(0071)]
Ignoring me and leaving first... Is your Nature Hasty?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Wow! You’re going to get the secret armor! What kind of armor do you think it is?
*sniff* Klara... She did her best...
*sniff* Avery... He did his best...
You were really, really great!
The last trial was just an ordinary Pokémon battle... I guess the master wanted a pure show of skill and strength?
What did the master tell you after your battle?
You’re really strong! I bet you’d really rake it in if you opened your own dojo, huh?
What an amazing battle! Klara did great, too!
What an amazing battle! Avery did great, too!
I thought I saw the Battle Court light up at the start of the battle. Maybe it was just my imagination...
I’d be honored to meet you on the field of battle someday.
Congrats! You were so cool!
One day...I’d like to be strong like you.
One day I hope to be as strong as... No, never mind. Use Amnesia and forget what I just said.
Everyone’s happy to win something, aren’t they? But losing is also something to be valued. It’s the fuel that propels you to growth. Know what I mean, love?[VAR 0114(0074)]

Aw, too bad. Your Boxes are maxed out! Try to make some space![VAR 0114(0073)]

Bear?
This Pokémon is in fact the secret armor of the Master Dojo! Say hello to...Kubfu![VAR 0114(0073)]
I know... I know... It’s tiny... But raise it with diligence, and it’ll become strong enough to see you through any battle, just like a suit of armor. No opponent will be able to get past it![VAR 0114(0073)]
This one in particular has amazing potential! Problem is—it’s a bit shy...[VAR 0114(0073)]
It just doesn’t seem to have much confidence in itself.[VAR 0114(0073)]
So I was thinking, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Maybe if it joins you on your adventure, that’ll help it break out of its shell a little bit![VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 6]
So take good care of Kubfu, ’K? It’s in your hands now![VAR 0114(0073)]
B-bearma...
Kubfu became your Pokémon!
Now then...[VAR 0114(0073)]
The first thing for you to do is become best friends with Kubfu! You need to build trust![VAR 0114(0073)]
Kubfu hasn’t really had a chance to explore the world outside the dojo, so...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Maybe it’ll help you become better friends if you let it have a look around! Maybe take it to a spot that has a [VAR FF00(0006)]great view[VAR FF00(0000)] of the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’ll have my students standing at good spots, so just keep an eye out![VAR 0114(0073)]
And of course having battles or camping out together will also help you become more friendly toward each other.[VAR 0114(0073)]
What else...? Oh, I know! I hereby grant you permission to keep a Pokémon out of its Poké Ball here on the Isle of Armor! You can now let the Pokémon at the head of your team out of its Poké Ball and [VAR FF00(0006)]take it for a stroll[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’ll be friends in no time if you walk together! Go and take a stroll with Kubfu, why don’t you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Once you’re best buddies, we’ll start Kubfu’s training in earnest. Just stop by and let me know once you think you’re ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
So, the secret armor was actually a Pokémon! Who’d have thought? And those moves... It was really something else!
Klara seems down in the dumps... I wonder if there’s anything I can do to cheer her up...
Avery seems down in the dumps... I wonder if there’s anything I can do to cheer him up...
I’m going to start preparing now—just so I’m not caught off guard if the master decides to send us out on another sudden trial!
Think about the meaning of what you’re doing, and it’ll help you focus even more.
There are lots of little islands around the Isle of Armor. If you have a bike that lets you ride on water, it might be fun to go and explore!
I guess I can take a break in training for now. Maybe I’ll go gather tons of Armorite Ore!
I wonder when they’ll get around to making a Dojo Uniform in my size...
I heard that the master found Kubfu overseas during his travels and brought it back to Galar.
The secret armor had some moves! I can’t wait to see how it grows!
Kubfu is so cute! I should’ve tried harder on the trials!

Aw, you’ve hardly gotten to know each other at all! Go on, then. Spend more time together! Go have some fun![VAR 0114(0073)]
Getting there, but there’s still lots of room for improvement. Your bond will become stronger as you have battles and gain experience together![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oooh! I can tell you’re warming up to each other! I hear a Soothe Bell is great for becoming friends with Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’re just starting to become friends! How wonderful! Don’t forget—playing together while camping is a great way to build camaraderie![VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 5]
I put some little markers on your Town Map for where the view of the Isle of Armor’s just gorgeous. You and Kubfu should go and enjoy the scenery![VAR 0114(0073)]
Once you two are the best of friends, we’ll start with Kubfu’s proper training![VAR 0114(0073)]
Bearmor!
Good, good! You two are just the best of friends now, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Kubfu’s really become more confident. How wonderful![VAR 0114(0073)]
I daresay I think you’re both ready.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Follow me, you two.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Hmm? Why, [VAR 0100(0000)], I don’t see Kubfu in your team or in your Boxes.[VAR 0114(0073)]
There’s no point in this training without Kubfu. Are you sure you want to continue?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Are you sure you won’t regret continuing with the training, even without Kubfu?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Well then, follow me.[VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s what I thought! We’ll continue with the training once you bring Kubfu back![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hmm? Oh, Kubfu’s at the Pokémon Nursery? I guess I’ll have to wait until it’s back with you to see how friendly you’ve become![VAR 0114(0073)]

Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And Kubfu! If you want to become stronger...[VAR 0114(0073)]
there are special training grounds just for Kubfu![VAR 0114(0073)]
Prepare yourselves for the...[VAR FF00(0006)]Towers of Two Fists[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
The blue tower is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tower of Waters[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
And the red tower is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tower of Darkness[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Choose wisely, since you’ll only be able to climb one of the two towers.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Kubfu’s fighting style will change depending on the tower you choose... And the [VAR FF00(0006)]types it gets[VAR FF00(0000)] [VAR FF00(0006)]will change[VAR FF00(0000)] as well! Think carefully![VAR 0114(0073)]
Each tower’s five stories tall, and each floor has a tough opponent waiting for you. Make sure you [VAR FF00(0006)]level up Kubfu properly[VAR FF00(0000)] before trying to climb up![VAR 0114(0073)]
You can reach both of the towers by heading through the Forest of Focus.[VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
You might even be able to find a shortcut if you can ride your bike across the river![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m really looking forward to when you two make it to the top of one of those towers! It’s going to be so exciting![VAR 0114(0073)]
The Towers of Two Fists were made specially for Kubfu to train in to help it grow. Pick either the Tower of Waters or the Tower of Darkness, and try to reach the top![VAR 0114(0073)]
You need to challenge the [VAR FF00(0006)]Towers of Two Fists[VAR FF00(0000)], special training grounds for Kubfu![VAR 0114(0073)]
You really need to have Kubfu with you for this training, though...[VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s not too late to find Kubfu though! Come here together so you can start your training![VAR 0114(0073)]

Once [VAR 0100(0000)] does what [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is meant to do, it will be time for the next step...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Such talent and strength... Perhaps the time has come.[VAR 0114(0073)]

The next step can wait until [VAR 0100(0000)] does what [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she needs to do...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Nothing, nothing. Just talking to myself![VAR 0114(0073)]
The Trainers in the Towers of Two Fists are all senior students of the dojo! I hear that once they’re called to duty, they go to the towers and just stay there, ready for any challenger.
Klara seems to be taking her training seriously these days! Maybe it’s something she ate?
Avery seems to be taking his training seriously these days! Maybe it’s something he ate?
I heard that way back when, Champion Leon tried to get to the Towers of Two Fists but got lost along the way. They say he somehow managed to wander all the way back to Postwick!
I could evolve it into a Water type...or maybe a Dark type... But then Kubfu is cute as is, too! I wonder what I’d do if it were up to me.
The scenery is just top-notch around the Tower of Waters. The master and Ms. Honey often go for walking dates around the area!
I wish there was some way to make tons of money really quickly...
Once I get stronger, I’m going to participate in the next Gym Challenge!
Sometimes I get really lonely and want to go back home, but then Ms. Honey gives me a hug, and that always makes me feel better.
So I hear you successfully climbed one of those towers. Most impressive... I mean, I’ve never attempted it, but I imagine it is very challenging...
I’d planned to be on my way once I completed my training, but I ended up just hanging around. It’s just so comfortable and calming here!
I want to become stronger than everyone else, but I guess that means I have to work harder than everyone else, too. Even if it’s super tedious![VAR 0114(0071)]
In order to defeat others, I need to first be able to defeat myself. I understand that now. In theory, anyway...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Hm? You have it holding an Everstone. That must mean...[VAR 0114(0073)]
You can’t have Kubfu look at the scroll while it’s holding an Everstone!

Oh! Hey, welcome back, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like you’ve been hard at work keeping up your training here at the dojo, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop?! What’re you doing here?!
Oh, Hop. You’re here, too?
Surprise! And nicely done, [VAR 0100(0000)]. That’s just the reaction I was hoping for![VAR 0114(0005)]
Where’s the surprise, mate? The welcome? Acting like I’m something the Meowth dragged in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m here on the Isle of Armor to research more about the Dynamax phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, I hear that you two are friends! How delightful![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hoppy-kins here was just asking my permission to camp out on the Isle of Armor... But where’s the fun in mucking about in the mud? I was telling him he should stay here— at the dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
I mean, it’d be loads easier than camping out for a long while, but wouldn’t I be in the way?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Everybody’s welcome to wear out their welcome at the Master Dojo! Don’t be shy, my boy![VAR 0114(0073)]
Besides, we’re practically family already. You’re the little brother of our Leon, after all![VAR 0114(0073)]
Yeah, it’s true—Lee did train here when we were both kids...[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right then, Master Mustard. You’ve twisted my arm! I hope you don’t regret it, because I’m staying![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoo! The more the merrier! I’m pleased as punch in a gold-plated punch bowl![VAR 0114(0073)]
Which reminds me, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0073)]
I’ve got something I’ve been meaning to tell you about Kubfu...or, really, its Evolution—Urshifu.[VAR 0114(0073)]
The truth is the lovable rascal is capable of Gigantamaxing, too.[VAR 0114(0073)]
But it’s a bit tricky, because it really can’t stand the taste of Max Mushrooms. So Max Soup is off the menu, unless you can make it more appealing to it.[VAR 0114(0073)]
There’s a [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] you can find here on the Isle of Armor, though, that’ll make even Urshifu gobble up a bowl of Max Soup...[VAR 0114(0073)]
And that [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] is...[VAR 0114(0073)]
That certain...something...is—?![VAR 0114(0005)]
That certain something... It’s actually...[VAR 0114(0073)]
The suspense here is killing me...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Actually...I’ve forgotten what it is! Oopsie-doopsie![VAR 0114(0073)]
Are you kidding me?! Noooooo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Mufufufu! You’re even more fun to tease than your brother ever was![VAR 0114(0073)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] I’m thinking of is sure to make Max Soup more palatable to Urshifu... and it has something to do with another Pokémon![VAR 0114(0073)]
Now I think I’ll let the two of you figure out just what it is. Give it a good think together![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’re on your own, kiddos! The world is your Cloyster, so get cracking![VAR 0114(0073)]
Is this, uh, how your training usually goes?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve really got no Rapidash in this race, but even I’m pretty curious about that [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I read something about Urshifu in a book once, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s the Wushu Pokémon, right? The book said it lives in the mountains in some far-off region.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Does it really?
That’s pretty amazing, Hop!
Huh? You didn’t know? Don’t you have one, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Naw, it’s nothing. I just happened to be researching foreign Pokémon lately is all![VAR 0114(0005)]
But yeah, I think I read that Urshifu is absolutely mad for some kind of [VAR FF00(0006)]sticky honey[VAR FF00(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Honey is made from the nectar of flowers and plants, right? So maybe we need nectar made by some Pokémon that look like flowers and plants! And if we’re looking for those kinds of Pokémon, then I’d reckon there might be lots in a forest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be able to look into Dynamaxing along the way, so count me in for some exploration![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s a forest past that big marshland, right? Bet I can still beat you there![VAR 0114(0005)]

Finally, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve been waiting forever for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d thought Glimwood Tangle was a real maze, but this place is on an entirely different level... And it’s so hot and humid that I’m sweating a pond over here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia and I split up places to survey. And she opted for the cold and snow—and all. Too bad we can’t somehow divide this heat up between us, too. We’d both feel a bit better![VAR 0114(0005)]
Anyway, I was checking out this Forest of Focus place while I was waiting for you to show up... and I saw signs that [VAR FF00(0006)]Lilligant[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Applin [VAR FF00(0000)]live here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Maybe we can gather a bit of sweet nectar that Urshifu should love from their flowers and fruit.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon [VAR FF00(0006)]Lilligant[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Applin[VAR FF00(0000)] are the most likely Pokémon to produce any nectar here in the Forest of Focus. Let’s see if they can’t spare a bit for Urshifu![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel1_main_0294

Tili...
Look! It’s a Petilil![VAR 0114(0005)]
Petilil evolves into Lilligant, which is just the Pokémon we’re looking for![VAR 0114(0005)]
Peh...
Hey, doesn’t that Petilil seem to be acting a bit strange?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It looks sort of sad
It looks a bit lost
Yeah, now that you mention it...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s still pretty little... Maybe it got separated from its parents?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Tilili!
Whoa! Who’re you glomming onto, mate?! You really must be lost if you think I’m your mum![VAR 0114(0005)]
And now I’m stuck. OK...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotta help us out here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Go find us one of Petilil’s parents or something, would you? Look for some worried-looking Lilligant![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll wait here with this little one. I’m afraid I’ll step on it if I start walking around![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lilligant is a Pokémon that’s got this big flower blooming on its head. You can’t miss it! And we wanted to find one anyway, right? We’re catching two Rookidee with one ball![VAR 0114(0005)]
Peh...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel1_main_0295

Lil...
Lilli?
We’ve got your Petilil!
Have you lost a Petilil?!
Liiigant!
Lilligant wants to follow you!
Lead it to where Hop and Petilil are waiting!
Finally, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And you found Lilligant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lilliii!
Tilil!
Hehe, looks like they’re both pretty happy to see each other.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gant tu!
What d’ya think, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I’d say Lilligant is trying to thank you.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Lili!
Huh? Is this...some of the nectar from your flower, Lilligant?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gant tuuu!
Til lil!
See ya, Petilil! See ya, Lilligant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Now we’ve got some of Lilligant’s nectar![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hopefully this nectar’s sweet and sticky, just like Urshifu likes it...[VAR 0114(0005)]
*sluuurp*[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hrmmm... I definitely wouldn’t call it very sticky. It’s pretty watery...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t think this is what you need, mate, but at least we did a good deed anyway.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on! Let’s give Applin’s nectar a try next![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, you brought Lilligant? Er... No, you definitely did not. Did you lose it along the way, maybe? Go find it! My feet are falling asleep here![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel1_main_0296
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
App?
There! It’s an Applin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Appawaaay!
Applin! No, wait![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is rotten... I don’t see that Applin anywhere![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m sure it went rolling off this way...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We’ve gotta find that Applin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Something wrong with that Berry tree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Piiiiii!
Ouch! The Applin clocked you right on the head!
Awaaaylin!
Augh! It ran off again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Uh, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Is your head feeling a bit...moist?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s gotta be Applin’s nectar on you![VAR 0114(0005)]
It might’ve given us the slip, but at least we still got what we came for![VAR 0114(0005)]
But is Applin’s nectar sweet enough for Urshifu? Well, like they say—the proof is in the pudding! Or the Applin! So let’s give it a try![VAR 0114(0005)]
*sluuurp*[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hrmmm... I don’t think you’d describe it as sticky exactly... It’s more like juice or something...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 18]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel1_main_0298
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lilligant’s nectar wasn’t it... Applin’s nectar wasn’t it...[VAR 0114(0005)]
They weren’t really sticky enough to be the sticky honey that Urshifu loves...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come to think of it, they aren’t really honey at all, are they?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I was thinking nectar and honey were the same thing, so I was looking for plants and flowers. But was I just barking up the wrong tree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Pede.
Whoa, a Venipede! I don’t see one of those every day![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s cute looking, right? But it can produce a really thick, gooey poison inside its body—making it pretty dangerous.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Th...that’s it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was stuck on Pokémon that produce nectar... But what we really need is a Pokémon that USES that sort of nectar to produce something else![VAR 0114(0005)]
Something like honey?!
You just noticed?!
Yes![VAR 0114(0005)]
And when it comes to Pokémon that collect and store up lots of nectar to make honey... well, the answer is obvious, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sheep Pokémon!
Beehive Pokémon!
Er, no, that’d be Wooloo. It might eat grass, but it can’t produce honey...[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Beehive Pokémon has got to be the answer! I’m sure of it this time![VAR 0114(0005)]
And Vespiquen is the Beehive Pokémon, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Have you ever seen one?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If we’re talking about the Isle of Armor...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think we should find some on the [VAR FF00(0006)]island shaped[VAR FF00(0000)] [VAR FF00(0006)]like a honeycomb[VAR FF00(0000)] over near that big blue tower![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that we know where we’re going, I’m off! Don’t make me wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel1_main_0300
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Glad you could finally make it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve seen loads of Combee around, but no sign of Vespiquen so far... But they’re the ones that’d have sticky honey.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? I borrowed a Power Spot Detector from Sonia, but why’s it going off now?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Is it...reacting to this tree here?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Something’s got to be up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I think we should check it out![VAR 0114(0005)]

There’s a cloying smell of thick, rich honey coming from the top of the tree!
Will you shake it?
Vvvvvvvvvrrrrrrrrrnnnnnn!
Wh-what is happening now?![VAR 0114(0005)]
*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*
Gyargh?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh bee haiiiiivvv!
Whatever it is that came from the tree sucks you into the Pokémon Den!
The aftershocks of the battle caused a strange comb of honey to fall from above!
I sure wasn’t expecting a Dynamaxed Vespiquen to come swooping out to attack us![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was too shocked to even think of joining you in the battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
That is some seriously sticky honey. I’m sure it’s the [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] Urshifu loves![VAR 0114(0005)]
And it seems like that honey was setting off my Power Spot Detector, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Max Mushrooms and this honey you can find here on the Isle of Armor... they both seem to have some kind of tie to Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s tons we don’t yet know about it, so there’s tons of research just waiting to be done.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on! You got the thing you were looking for, so let’s head back to the dojo at once![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel1_main_0310
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome back, my wandering Wooloo...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, and what is that sweet scent I detect... wafting through the air around you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’d be the Max Honey that Urshifu loves to the max! We got our hands on a nice haul of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Did you now? Already?![VAR 0114(0073)]
You put me and [VAR 0100(0000)] on it, old man! There’s nothing the two of us can’t do together![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hufufu! You did a real bang up job finding that Max Honey with hardly a hint from me![VAR 0114(0073)]
Very nicely done, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And our little Hop, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
You didn’t forget for a second what that “certain something” was, did you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If we add Max Honey to our Max Soup, even Urshifu will be sure to want a sip!
Bearmor!
Urrrfu!
Well, it’s been real, [VAR 0100(0000)]. But I think you’ve learned just about everything the Master Dojo has to teach you.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Which means that you and I can finally have a proper battle—with absolutely no holding back![VAR 0114(0073)]
I could use a bit of training if I’m going to be ready for what’s to come, after all...[VAR 0114(0073)]
I won’t be pulling any punches this time, kiddo. If you think you’re really ready for me when I’m serious, then come to the Battle Court out back![VAR 0114(0073)]
Battling the master when he’s serious... That’s seriously terrifying.
He’s the one who taught Lee all he knows, so Mustard’s got to be one wicked-strong Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
Course he is! Steel your spirit for serious battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
I guess I’d better start getting serious about the research I came here to do, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good luck with your things, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m sure you’ll manage—like you always do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll come dashing right back to catch that battle, though, if you do try taking on Master Mustard![VAR 0114(0005)]
I can make some Max Soup that even Kubfu’s Evolution, Urshifu, will drink. As long as you’ve got both Max Honey and Max Mushrooms, that is.

Wait—Hop is Leon’s little brother? THAT Leon?! And you seem to be really friendly with him... Who ARE you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
That innocent, pure smile of delight when Hop is happy about something is just so... Ah! No! What am I thinking?! Twisted, vindictive Klara is the only one for me!
That innocent, pure smile of delight when Hop is happy about something is just so... Ah! No! What am I thinking?! Pompous, misguided Avery is the only one for me!
There’re rumors about some training method here at the Master Dojo that’s too hard for normal people, so it’s kept secret...
I started thinking about which type I would evolve a Kubfu into. And before I knew it, the sun was going down, and I’d lost a whole day!
Want to hear something scary? They say there’s a lady somewhere on the Isle of Armor who can take away all your Pokémon’s training in the blink of an eye...
Hey, isn’t it about time for the next Gym Challenge to begin? The master is always hogging the TV, so we’re really behind on the news out here...
That Hop really is something! One of my Pokémon got injured, and he had it fixed right up in no time!
My mum’s latest letter said that Champion Leon had retired! Honestly, she’s so not funny. Who would believe a joke like that?
Hrmm?! There’s a certain tension in the air that tells me a fierce battle is ready to begin!
If you’re looking for the master, I saw him head to the Battle Court out back, looking all pleased about something...

Woo-hoo! Are you ready for another battle with little old me?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, don’t leave me hanging like this! I’m just itching for a battle![VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh heh! That’s what I want to hear! Then let’s mosey on over to the battleground![VAR 0114(0073)]
You know, I’ve been thinking more and more these days...[VAR 0114(0073)]
about how fortunate we were to have you join the dojo...[VAR 0114(0073)]
even if it was by mistake at first![VAR 0114(0073)]
I can’t thank you enough, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s been a while since I’ve been so excited! I can feel my blood burning and my heart just dancing with anticipation![VAR 0114(0073)]
I just can’t resist a battle against a worthy opponent—no matter how old I get![VAR 0114(0073)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Let’s get things going! This is the most fun time in the world![VAR 0114(0073)]
Fuhaha! I held absolutely nothing back, and yet you still defeated me![VAR 0114(0073)]
The apprentice surpasses h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser master... A true moment of pride for the master! You deserve a very special League Card from me![VAR 0114(0073)]
It seems I will have to redo my own training from scratch![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, darling! Did I hear right? You actually lost?![VAR 0114(0074)]
Ah, so you all came![VAR 0114(0073)]
You know I can’t resist seeing you get all serious about battle, you cheeky thing! You look utterly dashing, darling![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh! But look at me getting all distracted... You were amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Looks like we’ll need to have some Max Soup tonight to celebrate!
Well, I’m not surprised one bit, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I knew you’d win![VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew you weren’t just a new student! I think I’ll call you Master Newbie from now on!
And you were fabulous, too, [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Uraaa!

Um, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0071)]

I-I just...well... I guess I should congratulate you...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Well, um, how should I put this...? I thought mayhap I should offer my congratulations...[VAR 0114(0072)]
But I won’t! Why should I celebrate anything you do, huh?![VAR 0114(0071)]
But I won’t! Honestly, I don’t see why I should celebrate anything![VAR 0114(0072)]
Still, that cleared up a lot![VAR 0114(0071)]
I will admit...I do feel a bit better.[VAR 0114(0072)]
You’re strong enough to beat the master going all out! I never stood a chance![VAR 0114(0071)]
I couldn’t hold a candle to a Trainer who defeated the master at his full strength![VAR 0114(0072)]
But the next time I face you...[VAR 0114(0071)]
But when next we meet on the field of battle...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ll take you on fair and square! And I won’t lose... You’ll see![VAR 0114(0071)]
it will be I who takes the victory...in a fair fight, no less![VAR 0114(0072)]
I don’t think I’ll lose!
Are you sure?
Agh! You’re downright infuriating—you know that? Almost as bad as I am![VAR 0114(0071)]
Y-you’ve got quite the attitude! Though maybe it’s not as bad as mine...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well, at least she’s aware of her own flaws...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, at least he’s aware of his own flaws...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, that wraps up the last of the training here at the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, back to normal, huh, Master?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Oh, Master, I see you’re back to normal.[VAR 0114(0072)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
I hope you’ll come by and have more battles with me from time to time. It’ll make us both stronger![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just so we’re ready for when the time comes...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh! Oh, don’t worry! You’ll find out what I’m talking about eventually![VAR 0114(0073)]
Aaanyway, let’s all head back, shall we? Like one big family![VAR 0114(0073)]
Yeah!
[~ 53]
Wow, you’re eager to get the battle started! Come on, though—have a chat with me first![VAR 0114(0073)]
So, you’re the new Champion that beat Leon?! No wonder you’re so strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]...
I’ve noticed Klara sneaking off somewhere these days. She always comes back covered in sand. I wonder what she’s up to.
I’ve noticed Avery sneaking off somewhere these days. He always comes back covered in sand. I wonder what he’s up to.
I’ve been told that it was Master Mustard who gave this island the name “Isle of Armor.”
You know those digging people you run into from time to time here on the Isle of Armor? I wonder what they’re all about...
There’s a chance you’ll run into a Chansey around here. If you do, consider yourself lucky! You can get tons of Exp. Points!
I never would’ve guessed you’re the new Champion! What do you say? Why not team up with me so we can make lots of money?
That guy on soup duty... He’s up late at night, studying the path of soup! This is a dojo where people train to get stronger, but I guess it’s OK if soup has become his passion!
Is it true that Leon’s retired from being Champion?! And the new Champion’s standing right here... That’s too much news for me to handle!
What do you seek—strength or having fun? It doesn’t matter, really. You’ll find both with Pokémon.
Did you know that Master Mustard was the Champion back in the day?! What’s he doing running a dojo on this little island?

I can’t believe you beat the master, even when he was serious!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! You might be able to tackle this dojo’s most grueling type of training ever— [VAR FF00(0006)]Restricted Sparring[VAR FF00(0000)]!
If you have the courage to try it, let me know.

I’m gonna go on a Dynamax Adventure in the Max Lair, and I don’t need you breathing down my neck![VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m here to battle loads and loads of rare Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0042)]
Gahahaha! Don’t you fret![VAR 0114(0042)]

What a generous and totally unwanted offer! ’Fraid I’ve got to say “no, thanks”![VAR 0114(0042)]

Excuse me! Hello? Yes, you—the boy over there![VAR 0114(0042)]
Excuse me! Hello? Yes, you—the girl over there![VAR 0114(0042)]
My dad is stubborn as steel, and he won’t leave me alone! Back me up, would you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
What? Are you really brushing me off?! That’s ridiculously depressing![VAR 0114(0042)]
Gahahaaa! Wise of you not to stick your head into people’s business willy-nilly![VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh? Have you come around on helping me after all?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Brilliant! Have a great time with this geezer, then![VAR 0114(0042)]
Now hold on, lad![VAR 0114(0042)]
Now hold on, lass![VAR 0114(0042)]
Can’t say I approve of you buttin’ in blindly...[VAR 0114(0042)]
But if I just give you a trouncin’, this young lady here ought to see reason![VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Peony![VAR 0114(0076)]
Brace yourself—I’m pretty ferocious in battle![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahahaaa! Look at me, takin’ a thrashin’ from a youngster like you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahahaaa! You’ve got a bit of fight in you, but you’re still soft![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmm?[VAR 0114(0076)]
My darlin’ daughter’s disappeared! Where’ve you gone, my sweet Nia?![VAR 0114(0076)]
“Darlin’” daughter, huh?
Are you sure “sweet” is the word?
Of course! My Nia’s the sweetest, darlingest daughter a dad could ask for![VAR 0114(0076)]
I brought her out here so we could have a proper father-daughter trip. First one in ages![VAR 0114(0076)]
And now that we’ve got here, she grabs the first Trainer she finds, makes ’em a decoy, and legs it! That’s my dear Nia for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s just her backward way of showin’ her papa she loves him! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Must be
Is it?
That’s the type of girl she is! Ultra-mega-charmin’, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Still, without her, I can’t start this Adven-tour of legendary spots I’ve planned for us![VAR 0114(0076)]
She mentioned wantin’ to have a gander at someplace called the [VAR FF00(0006)]Max Lair[VAR FF00(0000)], didn’t she?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Sounds to me like she wants good old Papa to chase after her! Well, she needn’t worry— I’m not one for wastin’ time![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which means it’s time I got a move on. Cheers for a fine battle![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’ll be seein’ you, then, lad! Take care of th[VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]atose strong Pokémon of yours![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’ll be seein’ you, then, lad! Careful where you poke your head in next time![VAR 0114(0076)]

Hm? Oh, it’s you again! Well, kid, maybe you ought to come as well![VAR 0114(0076)]

Oh, I think you can! My precious daughter’s in there, and I’m goin’ in after her![VAR 0114(0076)]
I understand, sir, but—
But what?! I’m here to have an adventure, and I want to kick it off right now![VAR 0114(0076)]
I simply can’t allow it, sir!
Grrr![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh, there you are, lad! So you’ve come after all, have you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh, there you are, lass! So you’ve come after all, have you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right?
Something the matter?
Nothin’s all right, and everythin’s the matter![VAR 0114(0076)]
This ultra-mega-numpty of a scientist insists on gettin’ in my way![VAR 0114(0076)]
“Numpty of a—”? I beg your pardon, sir!
If you’d be so good as to simply listen, I could let you through!
Dynamax Adventures are quite fraught with peril, I’m afraid, and—
Gaaah! I’ve got no patience for standin’ here listenin’ to you rattle off the fine print![VAR 0114(0076)]
*sigh* We’re just going round in circles.
You seem to know this gentleman. Would you simply listen to my explanation?
If so, then I could allow the two of you to enter as a pair.
Aha! Now you’re talkin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Go on, then. Let’s hear what the good lady’s got to say! And then we’ll go find my little Nia together! Right? Right![VAR 0114(0076)]

Are you ready to hear my explanation of Dynamax Adventures?
Come on, mate! Don’t leave me hangin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Please pay the gentleman no mind. Come and speak to me when you’re prepared.
That’s what I like to hear, mate! I owe you one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Very well. Then I will proceed.
The Max Lair is a labyrinthine underground cavern where rare Pokémon dwell—the likes of which normally are not found in the Galar region.
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
To avoid the risk of Galar particle overexposure, which can cause your own dear Pokémon to lose control...
we have prepared Pokémon for you that are resistant to the particles’ effects.
Right, right—I follow you! You’re sayin’ you don’t want Galar losin’ control, so the Pokémon rent some particles, and we might see a rare overexposure![VAR 0114(0076)]
That was stunningly incorrect, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Please make sure you’ve a firm grasp of the rules.
I’m still a touch lost, but...that’s the type of place this is, eh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Right! Sounds like this is all a bit beyond me, so I’ll just go on in and get crackin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Here comes Papa, my darling Niaaa![VAR 0114(0076)]
Sir! No! I’ve just told you it’s too dangerous!
What is going on with that man? He looks so much like Chairman Rose, but his attitude doesn’t match the chairman’s at all...
Well, when you’re ready to go chase him down— *sigh* Pardon me. I meant, when you’re ready to begin your Dynamax Adventure, please let me know.

Wow, what a perfect name for you! It really suits you![VAR 0114(0078)]
Pffft! That how you always talk? It’s not bad![VAR 0114(0078)]
So is my dad on his way here, too? I haven’t seen him... Has he got turned around and wound up back at the entrance?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Listen—sorry for using you to distract my old man back there.[VAR 0114(0078)]

What? You held your own against my old man?![VAR 0114(0078)]
He used to be a Gym Leader, you know. Even on holiday, he’s no pushover![VAR 0114(0078)]
Y’know, my dad was going mad with excitement for this trip.[VAR 0114(0078)]
He kept going on about how he’d planned for us to check out local legends on this super-intense adventure tour—or “Adven-tour” as he calls it...[VAR 0114(0078)]
But I mean, come on! What girl my age would be caught dead doing some naff thing like that with her dad?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Besides, I really fancy having more battles with Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0078)]
Ahhh, the thrill of battling one of those massive, towering Pokémon... Just thinking about it gets me pumped! Hee hee![VAR 0114(0078)]
You know what? I’ve just had a thought! You’re a pretty fierce Trainer, right?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Then I bet you could handle takin’ my place on my old man’s Adven-tour![VAR 0114(0078)]
Sounds like great fun!
Rather not, thanks
Too right it does! It’s a brilliant idea, if I do say so myself![VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh, no need to worry! He’ll take good care of you...despite all appearances to the contrary.[VAR 0114(0078)]
He’s so hyped up about all this. It’d be a shame to just leave him on his own.[VAR 0114(0078)]
And who knows? You could end up running into a Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0078)]
How about I meet back up with you two after I’ve had my own fun in the Max Lair?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Go on, then. Enjoy your twosome tour of legends![VAR 0114(0078)]

Wait, lass! Don’t go! Did you find my Nia? Did you?![VAR 0114(0076)]
The poor gentleman has been injured. After much kicking and screaming, I’ve brought him back here.
Agh! It hurts! It ultra-mega-hurts! Nia! Where’s my darlin’ Niaaa?[VAR 0114(0076)]
What happened?
Are you all right?
This fine gentleman appears to have tripped on a rock and struck his head.
Hnngh... Adventures aren’t to be taken lightly. I’ve learned that firsthead now— Firsthand, I mean.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I was just checkin’ to see if my little girl was behind some rocks, and look how I’ve ended up![VAR 0114(0076)]
Behind some rocks? Is your daughter a Rolycoly, sir?
There we go—I’m up! No little bump’s gonna keep me down long. That kip’s got me feelin’ right as rain![VAR 0114(0076)]
How about it then, lad? Did you find my darlin’ Nia?[VAR 0114(0076)]
How about it then, lass? Did you find my darlin’ Nia?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I did, but...
Well, here’s how it went...
Hmmm... You don’t say.[VAR 0114(0076)]
So dear Nia’s set on stayin’ away till she’s had her fill of this Dynamax Adventure stuff...[VAR 0114(0076)]
and she wants the two of us to go ahead and get crackin’ on the grand Peony Adven-tour?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You know, I burned the candle at both ends working out the best itinerary I could for my dear Nia’s sake...[VAR 0114(0076)]
But I guess she’s at that age when she doesn’t want her old man taggin’ along all the time.[VAR 0114(0076)]
And tryin’ to press her into doin’ what I wanna do probably won’t win me any “dad of the year” awards.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Right, then! What’s your name, kid?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Cheers, [VAR 0100(0000)]! My name’s Peony! Wait—have I already told you so? Gahaha! Then it’s twice as nice to meet you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let’s have ourselves such a smashin’ adventure that my dear Nia’ll be itchin’ to join in the fun![VAR 0114(0076)]
Yes, let’s!
Erm...
Now that’s an ultra-mega-great response! Just what I was hopin’ to hear! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! Don’t fret, now! I’ve done all sorts of preparations already![VAR 0114(0076)]
We’re goin’ to have ourselves a real treat of a Legendary Pokémon hunt![VAR 0114(0076)]
So that’s decided! Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let’s get ourselves to Freezington! It’s a town just a short ways off. Time for a strategic plannin’ meetin’ for Peony’s Adven-tour![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’ll fill you in on the details once you get there! I say, let us reconvene posthaste![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ha! Just pullin’ your leg. Can you imagine if I actually talked like that?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaaahahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
What a...unique fellow. Uniquely boisterous to be sure.
Please do hurry and meet your friend in Freezington as he asked... before he decides to come back.

Hello, hello! What have we here? Another visitor?[VAR 0114(0042)]
I am the mayor of this fair town of Freezington.[VAR 0114(007A)]
I must say, it’s a surprise to have visitors arriving in our out-of-the-way town one after another.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Might you be here to learn about the legend of [VAR FF00(0006)]the King of Bountiful Harvests[VAR FF00(0000)] as well?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Ah, never mind. It hardly bears asking.[VAR 0114(007A)]
After all, there’s very little otherwise to attract visitors to our sleepy corner of the region.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Which is a bit of a shame, really...[VAR 0114(007A)]
People come all this way to investigate what turns out to be a mere fairy tale.[VAR 0114(007A)]
But since you’ve made the journey, I must offer you this Freezington specialty as a memento![VAR 0114(007A)]
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
It’s a shirt emblazoned with the likeness of the King of Bountiful Harvests. I’m afraid it hasn’t sold quite as well as we’d hoped. We’ve got a fair number left over...[VAR 0114(007A)]
The illustration’s based on extremely ancient accounts of the king’s appearance. Hence the unusually sized head.[VAR 0114(007A)]
But we thought it might make the design a touch more “hip,” as they say...[VAR 0114(007A)]
If you’d like to see what the king really looked like, I suggest you take a look at the statue by the fields in the center of our village.[VAR 0114(007A)]
By the by, while you’re here in the Crown Tundra, feel free to let your lead Pokémon out of its ball and [VAR FF00(0001)]take it for a stroll[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(007A)]
Farewell for now, then.[VAR 0114(007A)]

Aha! Here you are![VAR 0114(0076)]
This poky little place will be our lodgings![VAR 0114(0076)]
But as of this moment, it’s also somethin’ far more important—our base camp![VAR 0114(0076)]
I know, I know. Not much of a base camp, is it? Still, we’ve got to give it a proper air of importance, haven’t we?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Now, enough faffin’ about, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let me tell you what the Peony Exploration Team is after![VAR 0114(0076)]
Round here, they’ve got a fair few strange and mysterious legends![VAR 0114(0076)]
FOR EXAMPLE![VAR 0114(0076)]
A huge-headed Pokémon known as the King of Bountiful Harvests![VAR 0114(0076)]
NOT TO MENTION![VAR 0114(0076)]
A massive red tree where legendary flyin’ Pokémon gather![VAR 0114(0076)]
AND FURTHERMORE![VAR 0114(0076)]
These great, hulkin’ dot-faced giants that sleep in some ruins or somethin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
ET CETERA![VAR 0114(0076)]
See what I mean? This place is just burstin’ with juicy legends![VAR 0114(0076)]
And we’re not stoppin’ until we’ve found just how much truth they’ve got to ’em![VAR 0114(0076)]
And there you have it! We are the Peony Exploration Team...[VAR 0114(0076)]
and that is our grand, noble, magnificent goal![VAR 0114(0076)]
Course, if I had my way, I’d be doin’ this with my darlin’ Nia...[VAR 0114(0076)]
But who knows? They say even Chansey meetings can lead to Blissey-ful friendships![VAR 0114(0076)]
So here’s to a grand adventure, Expedition Chief [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
Chief?
Who, me?
Obviously![VAR 0114(0076)]
Look... What do you think would happen if the two of us went gallivantin’ off together?[VAR 0114(0076)]
My dear Nia could come along for a grand, emotional reunion...and find this place empty![VAR 0114(0076)]
Just the thought of it... My own darlin’ daughter, sittin’ alone in this room, pinin’ for her papa...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gaaah! Nope, not on my watch! I’d never let that happen![VAR 0114(0076)]
So I’ll be the hold-down-the-fort chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which means you get the pleasure of bein’ the expedition chief! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which brings me to...this! Go on—have it![VAR 0114(0076)]
You got an [VAR FF00(0008)]Expedition Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Gahaha! Look at that. Fits you like a glove![VAR 0114(0076)]
I brought some spare uniforms so my dear Nia would have a few to change into. So there’s enough to give you one![VAR 0114(0076)]
And if you ever need to change or have a kip, by all means...[VAR 0114(0076)]
just head into the bedroom back here![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’ve got some different-colored scarves in there, so switch it up if you fancy a bit of style![VAR 0114(0076)]
Here—have these, too![VAR 0114(0076)]
They’re Legendary Clues I’ve meticulously compiled from hours of dedicated telly watchin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
First off, why not have a look at that clue about the King of Bountiful Harvests?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Seems like this king’s bonds with its loyal steed— or whatever you call it—run proper deep! So if I had to name this expedition, I’d call it...[VAR 0114(0076)]
There’s a great, big statue of it bang in the middle of the village! Though its head isn’t as massive as in my notes...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Do you want to change back into your usual clothes?
All set! Time to investigate the legends surrounding the Crown Tundra!
No need to change! Time to investigate the legends surrounding the Crown Tundra!
Aha! I’ve just had an idea. Here’s a little somethin’ to help you out![VAR 0114(0076)]
This is supposed to be one ultra-mega-corker of a ball! Use it wherever you think you ought to![VAR 0114(0076)]
I got it ages ago from somebody I used to know. Never could bring myself to use it, though...[VAR 0114(0076)]
If you ever get a bit turned around, come on back to base camp anytime![VAR 0114(0076)]
You can’t miss it—just look for the adventurin’- crew flag I stuck out front! Handmade by yours truly![VAR 0114(0076)]
Anyway, I suppose that’s that! Let the grand adventure begin! Have a smashin’ time out there![VAR 0114(0076)]

Hey, Chief! My pillow’s caught your eye, eh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Your...pillow?
Yeah, it’s great!
Righto! Ultra-mega-nice, isn’t it? Just the shape and firmness I need![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oi, listen here, Chief. I’ve got some wisdom to impart.[VAR 0114(0076)]
If you can put your head on it and have a kip, it’s a pillow![VAR 0114(0076)]
Unfortunately, I went and left my favorite pillow back at home.[VAR 0114(0076)]
So I went to have a look around town for somethin’ to rest my head on... and I found this out back behind the inn![VAR 0114(0076)]
Can I have it?
I see
I’m in for one ultra-mega-comfy sleep tonight. That’s for certain![VAR 0114(0076)]
What’s the matter, Chief? Can’t get my pillow off your mind?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I was only looking
Heh heh heh! Well, look all you like! Sear it right into your eyeballs![VAR 0114(0076)]
C-come off it! You want me to hand over my ultra-mega-comfy pillow?![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s askin’ a lot, even comin’ from you, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hm? What’s that?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You think my pillow’s got somethin’ to do with a Legendary Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gaaah, ultra-mega-seriously?! This is just some old thing I found![VAR 0114(0076)]
But if you really want it, Chief... Who am I to refuse?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right, all right! Go on, then—have it![VAR 0114(0076)]
But you’d better make sure you track that legend down![VAR 0114(0076)]

It’s a statue of Pokémon! But somehow it feels as if it’s missing something...
It looks like the Wooden Crown could fit onto the statue here... Do you want to try fitting it on?
*rustle rustle*
*shwunk*
The Wooden Crown fit perfectly on the statue!

It seems as if the mysterious Pokémon wants to test your strength.
Do you want to ready a Poké Ball?
Cra! Rowcrown![VAR 0114(0042)]
Rrrrrrrrow...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Rrrooow.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The mysterious Pokémon has a puzzled look on its face.
Cracrown crow. Roooooowwwn rown crown.[VAR 0114(0042)]

What’s this now, Chief? Were you havin’ a Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0076)]

Huh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
What a massive noggin![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hrm. Ruumm crorown. Cracrown.[VAR 0114(0042)]

Eaghhh![VAR 0114(0076)]
Mlerrrgh...[VAR 0114(0076)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0077)]
Ah, yes. A sturdy body, just as I expected.[VAR 0114(0077)]
I hope he doesn’t mind that I make use of it for the time being.[VAR 0114(0077)]
Chief Peony?
Are you the Pokémon?
An understandable reaction, but the answer is no.[VAR 0114(0077)]
Oh? I see you have grasped the situation already. Very astute of you![VAR 0114(0077)]
I am Calyrex. I am the one known as the King of Bountiful Harvests.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I have borrowed this man’s body in order to thank you in person...so to speak.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Indeed, there are no words to adequately express my gratitude toward you for restoring my statue.[VAR 0114(0079)]
In days long past, I reigned over these lands as king.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The humans offered me their loyalty and respect, as I was able to bring lush vegetation to the land and give them plentiful harvests year after year.[VAR 0114(0079)]
However, it seems that over many, many years, the people of this land have forgotten my existence.[VAR 0114(0079)]
They used to make offerings to me every year, but even that tradition has long since been lost to the ravages of time.[VAR 0114(0079)]
You see, it is the faith of the people that grants me strength...[VAR 0114(0079)]
And now I have lost all but a fraction of my former power. Even my loyal steed has abandoned me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
However, you were kind enough to restore my statue![VAR 0114(0079)]
That act has returned some strength to me, at least enough to speak to you by borrowing the body of another.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Now, kindhearted human child... I have a favor to ask of you.[VAR 0114(0079)]
[~ 42]
I must know once and for all whether the people have truly forgotten about me.[VAR 0114(0079)]

I wish you to speak to the villagers and ask if they remember the King of Bountiful Harvests.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I have tried asking them myself, you understand. But they treated me like some sort of fairy-tale creature or flew into a mild panic at the sight of me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Please, kindhearted human. I beg you to help me...[VAR 0114(0079)]

The King of Bountiful Harvests? Well, if it exists, why doesn’t it heal the land around here so we can grow crops for a change?
You want to know about the King of Bountiful Harvests? All I can tell you is its name. I think it was called Calvin! Or was it Calista?
The Pokémon king? Oh, sure, my gran used to tell me stories about it all the time when I was a kid. An old fairy tale, that...
The King of Bountiful Harvests? I used to believe it was real, you know? I was told that if I made mischief in the fields, the king would steal my body away.
Oh dear, I’m sorry. I’m rather busy doing nothing right now.
Do I remember the King of Bountiful Harvests? Why, of course I do! It’s only the main tourist attraction of our lovely Freezington, after all! I imagine we would see more visitors if only the king were real...[VAR 0114(007A)]
I would like you to ask the people of the village if they remember the King of Bountiful Harvests.[VAR 0114(0079)]

You’ve asked the people of Freezington about the King of Bountiful Harvests!
Time to report back to Calyrex!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_main_0114
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ah, human child! I trust you were able to speak to the villagers.[VAR 0114(0079)]
So, how was it? Did they say anything about me?[VAR 0114(0079)]
They did, but...
Just that you were a fairy tale...
Hmm... It is as I suspected. Nobody truly believes that I am real.[VAR 0114(0079)]
It seems the people of this land have indeed forgotten the bond they once shared with me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Hm? Oh, no, of course I am not grieving![VAR 0114(0079)]
I am the King of Bountiful Harvests, after all! I know better than to count on humans to remember me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
This proves beyond doubt that I cannot simply rely on human faith if I want my powers to return.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If only my loyal steed were to return to me, I would regain something of what I’ve lost...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Your loyal steed?
Is that a Pokémon?
Yes! The four-legged Pokémon that I used to ride all across the land.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The very same Pokémon that my statue in the village shows me riding.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Alas, though in ancient times we spent many days together, dashing through the valleys and over the mountains of this land...[VAR 0114(0079)]
my power waned, and I was forced to part ways with it. Now, I know not where it may be.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Even if we should succeed in locating my loyal steed, I have my doubts as to whether it has remained...well, loyal. I have lost so much power...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Perhaps the villagers know something about my... currently not-so-loyal steed. I would be in your debt if you could speak to the head of the village on my behalf.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you are able to find any information at all, I ask that you let me know...[VAR 0114(0079)]
*snort* Gah?![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh?! Chief?! With a massive noggin! Or... Wait. No, it’s normal.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I must’ve fallen asleep where I stood! Sorry ’bout that, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Still, I feel strange. Like my body’s not quite my own...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Guess I’ll head back to base and get some rest! ’Sides, it’s freezing out here![VAR 0114(0076)]
You want to know about the loyal steed of the King of Bountiful Harvests? Well, I’ve been told it was once a belligerent ruffian that would ruin all our harvests. Doesn’t sound like something I’d get along with!
The king’s loyal steed? Loyal steed, hm... You know, that reminds me—I know a lawyer named Steve in Motostoke. I wonder what lawyer Steve is up to these days?
I heard that the king’s loyal steed had a beautiful fur coat that was as dark as night.
The king’s loyal steed? I was told that it had a wondrous fur coat that was as white as untouched snow!
The king’s loyal steed is said to have had a favorite food. I can’t remember for the life of me what it was. The mayor knows a lot about the old legends like that.

The mayor’s not home at the moment.
He went to have a look at the fields in the Giant’s Bed.
You can go look for him if you’re in a hurry.
The fields in the Giant’s Bed are to the southeast of the village. Go through Frostpoint Field and just keep going to the left.

Text File : rigel2_main_0118

Alas, this field is no good, either...[VAR 0114(007A)]
The soil is barren... No crop could possibly grow here now.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Perhaps the lands of the Crown Tundra truly are beyond hope...[VAR 0114(007A)]
What’s this? Oh, our dear visitor! What brings you here?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? You want to learn about the loyal steed of the King of Bountiful Harvests?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Well, this is hardly the place for storytelling.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Come to my home in Freezington. It’s better to have a nice chat in the warmth, after all![VAR 0114(007A)]
Please visit whenever you’re ready. I’ll be waiting![VAR 0114(007A)]

Have you seen what’s happened to the statue of the King of Bountiful Harvests? Its head has become massive![VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? You say that’s the way the king’s supposed to look?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Now that you mention it, it does resemble the design on our town’s souvenir shirts... But you speak as if you’ve seen the king with your own two eyes![VAR 0114(007A)]

An old book I read long ago said that the king’s loyal steed was particularly fond of a certain special vegetable...[VAR 0114(007A)]
But my memory isn’t what it used to be. I can’t recall what exactly the steed so desired![VAR 0114(007A)]
I think it best that you search on the bookshelf over there if you want to find out any more.[VAR 0114(007A)]

Crow-row. Crrrrrown.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Hmmm? Oh, hey there, Chief! I had a feelin’ someone called me. Was it you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Mlerrrgh...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Human child! Were you able to find something out about my loyal steed?[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah, that is unfortunate... Should you find out anything, I ask that you let me know.[VAR 0114(0079)]
You say you found out about something that my loyal steed could not resist?![VAR 0114(0079)]
It has been so long since we rode together that I had completely forgotten...[VAR 0114(0079)]
With this information, we may be able to lure my loyal steed to me yet! So tell me—what is it that my loyal steed would find so irresistible?[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Reins of Unity
Carrots
The Freezington Snow Samba
The Freezington’s Fame shirt
Never mind—I don’t know...
Hmm... The Reins of Unity, you say? ’Tis true that they would help me regain the link with my loyal steed, but it has been many years since the humans made a new set of reins for me. I doubt we shall be able to obtain them now.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The...Freezington Snow Samba? I did see the villagers performing a strange dance some years ago, but it was hardly irresistible. In fact, I imagine even a Greedent would lose its appetite after one look at such an odd display.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah yes. The garment with my image on it. I suspect that even a poor facsimile of my visage would be enough to send my loyal steed running. Its loyalty is not what it used to be...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Oho! Carrots, you say![VAR 0114(0079)]
Yes, yes, I remember now... Even back when we were together, it would leap at any chance to eat some kind of crop. It took everything I had to restrain it![VAR 0114(0079)]
Looking back, the crop must have been carrots! I am in your debt, human child![VAR 0114(0079)]
What we must do now is clear. If we are able to find carrots somewhere, it should be but a trifle to lure my loyal steed back to me![VAR 0114(0079)]
I wonder... Do the humans of the village grow any carrots?[VAR 0114(0079)]
If we could obtain even a single seed, I could grow a carrot from it myself...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I wonder... Do the humans of the village grow any carrots? If we could obtain even a single seed, I could grow a carrot from it myself...[VAR 0114(0079)]
We don’t grow carrots in this village anymore. It’s a shame...
[~ 25]
I’ve got plenty of potatoes back home, but I haven’t seen carrots in a long time. Still, I’m sure somebody has some seeds, at least.
The Crown Tundra used to be well-known for the two types of carrots that were grown here. We don’t grow them anymore, though.

Welcome to Freezington. It must have been quite a journey to get here.
The Crown Tundra is famous for carrots, you know. Maybe you’d be interested in getting some Carrot Seeds as a souvenir?
Yes, please!
Uh, I’m good...
Hohoho! Quite the enthusiastic one, aren’t you?
Now now, no need to be shy!
Though I must admit, these seeds are rather valuable to us...
How about a trade? You bring me [VAR 0200(0001)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Dynite Ore, and I’ll give you the seeds.
Hoho! Life is all about quid pro go—or whatever the phrase was!
Do you want to trade [VAR 0200(0001)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Dynite Ore for the Carrot Seeds?
Well, the seeds aren’t going anywhere. Come back if you want to trade!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you don’t have enough Dynite Ore.
You handed over [VAR 0200(0001)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Dynite Ore!
Oh, wonderful! This is plenty! Now we can bury the ore in our fields and make our crops huge!
Here are the seeds, as promised!
Don’t go planting those seeds I gave you willy-nilly in the village’s fields, now! These fields are for our own crops!
Oh, you’re looking for carrots? Well, you won’t be finding any this time of year. We do have seeds right here...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_main_0128

Have you found the carrots, human child?[VAR 0114(0079)]
By the stars![VAR 0114(0079)]
You say that you have Carrot Seeds? That strange bag contains the seeds of carrots?[VAR 0114(0079)]
You humans never stop adapting and evolving. I am constantly amazed by your ingenuity.[VAR 0114(0079)]
And yet... Hmm. The fields of the village simply won’t do. They’re not suited for growing carrots.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If we could find rich soil, I could use my powers to grow the crops we need![VAR 0114(0079)]
Now...where might we find soil suited for growing these crops in this tundra of mine?[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah, I see two spots that might suit our needs. One is a field covered in pristine snow.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Another spot is a field by gravestones, where those who moved on were laid to rest.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Either of those locations should allow me to use my powers and grow the carrots we need.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Please, I ask that you choose a field and plant those seeds![VAR 0114(0079)]
*snort* Gah?![VAR 0114(0076)]
What in the—? I seem to be gettin’ in the habit of fallin’ asleep outside![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! I guess it just goes to show that holdin’ down the fort isn’t all that easy![VAR 0114(0076)]
You take care o’ yourself, Chief. Don’t overdo it![VAR 0114(0076)]
You marked the two fields Calyrex told you about on your Town Map!

It’s one of the fields Calyrex told you about!
Do you want to plant the Carrot Seeds in this field?
I see you have reached one of the fields.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Are you truly ready to plant the Carrot Seeds?[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you plant the seeds in this field, [VAR FF00(0006)]Iceroot Carrots[VAR FF00(0000)] will grow. It has been so long that my memory is hazy, but I believe that my loyal steed would often partake of this sort of vegetable. If Iceroot Carrots were what my steed preferred, it must have been [VAR FF00(0006)]Ice type[VAR FF00(0000)], mustn’t it? It’s most vexing that I can’t recall. I suppose we will see.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you plant the seeds in this field, [VAR FF00(0006)]Shaderoot Carrots[VAR FF00(0000)] will grow. It has been so long that my memory is hazy, but I believe that my loyal steed would often partake of this sort of vegetable. If Shaderoot Carrots were what my steed preferred, it must have been [VAR FF00(0006)]Ghost type[VAR FF00(0000)], mustn’t it? It’s most vexing that I can’t recall. I suppose we will see.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I will ask but once more... Are you sure this is the field in which you want to plant the seeds?[VAR 0114(0079)]
So you wish to reconsider? Very well... I shall return once you have made your choice.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Very well. Then I ask that you plant the seeds.[VAR 0114(0079)]
*dig dig dig*
You planted the Carrot Seeds in the field!
*pat pat*
Kah hah hah! Very good, very good. You have an able hand for working with soil![VAR 0114(0079)]

To think that I have fallen so low! It truly breaks my heart...[VAR 0114(0079)]
But soon it will be time to bid my sorrow farewell![VAR 0114(0079)]
Now, human child. I must ask that you pull that Iceroot Carrot free with all your might![VAR 0114(0079)]

Do you want to pull the carrot out?

Well done, human child![VAR 0114(0079)]
That carrot will be the key to luring my loyal steed back to me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
[~ 4]
Now all I need are the Reins of Unity. They will amplify my power, letting me ride my loyal steed with ease.[VAR 0114(0079)]
But I doubt I shall ever get another set from the humans in the village.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Brrriiice![VAR 0114(0042)]

What?! Glastrier, my loyal steed! Is it truly you?![VAR 0114(0079)]
What?! Spectrier, my loyal steed! Is it truly you?![VAR 0114(0079)]
That glistening white pelt... That rough, violent gallop...[VAR 0114(0079)]
That glossy black pelt... That rough, violent gallop...[VAR 0114(0079)]
It has not changed from the day we first met! Oh, how this brings back memories...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Brrrhm... Brrrferrm...
Shrrrrerrrm... Shrrrerrm...
It is my belief that while my steed picked up on the scent of the carrot, it could not determine where the scent was coming from.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Judging from the direction it ran off in, it must be headed to the village, in an attempt to pillage carrots there![VAR 0114(0079)]
If that is true, then Freezington is in danger! Human child, we must make haste![VAR 0114(0079)]
I-I won’t let a ruffian like that do anything to my precious fields!
Please help! There’s a Pokémon threatening our village!
That Pokémon... Is it the one from the fairy tales?!
A huge Pokémon like that could lay waste to our whole village! Please! Someone! Anyone! Get it to settle down!
Now, I wonder what all that commotion is about. Is it festival season already?
My loyal steed is endangering the villagers! But I am too weak... Please, human child! I beg you! Save the village![VAR 0114(0079)]

Brrrrm... Rrrrm...
Stop!
Wait!
Brrrrrriiiiiice!
Sheeeighhhhd!
Brrrm... Brm...
Neeeighce!
Braaark!
Eek!
Cra-crown![VAR 0114(0079)]
Brr?!
Brrriiice!
Sheighhhhd!
Are you all right?!
Y-yes... I feel like something stepped in to save me...
Oh, kind visitor! How could I possibly thank you enough for saving the people of this village?[VAR 0114(007A)]
I had no idea such a vicious Pokémon still existed in the tundra...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Why, it reminded me of that Pokémon in the fairy tales... The loyal steed of the king...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Ah, but no doubt I am overthinking things.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? What is that you have there? Is that a tuft of White Mane Hair?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? What is that you have there? Is that a tuft of Black Mane Hair?[VAR 0114(007A)]
In the fairy tales, it is said that by weaving the hair of the loyal steed together with a [VAR FF00(0006)]radiant[VAR FF00(0000)] [VAR FF00(0006)]blossom[VAR FF00(0000)] grown by the king...[VAR 0114(007A)]
it is possible to create the Reins of Unity, which link the king with its steed![VAR 0114(007A)]
In fact, it was my own ancestors who used to weave the Reins of Unity, following an ancient tradition passed down over many years.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Of course, I myself have never seen any kind of radiant flower, and the method of making the reins has also been lost to time.[VAR 0114(007A)]
In any case, we can’t spend all day musing over fairy tales![VAR 0114(007A)]
I must make plans and preparations. That Pokémon could well decide to pay us another visit, after all![VAR 0114(007A)]
Thank you very much for your help, kind traveler![VAR 0114(007A)]
Hey... Thanks for saving us.
Was that Pokémon really the one from the fairy tales? It looked very similar to be sure, but...
Thank goodness you happened to pass by! You really saved the day!
When that Pokémon was about to run into us, I just got this feeling that...some other Pokémon wearing a crown stepped in to save us.
Things have quieted down. I guess the festival’s over now?

You have my thanks for protecting the village, human child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Were I at my full power, I could have tamed my steed and regained its loyalty...[VAR 0114(0079)]
But weakened as I am now, the most I could do was influence its will and make it depart.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If only I had the Reins of Unity! They would have allowed me to tame my steed in short order![VAR 0114(0079)]
We can make a set!
We need a flower!
What’s that? We can make a set of reins with mane hair from my loyal steed...and a flower that I can grow?![VAR 0114(0079)]
A flower... A flower... Yes, but of course![VAR 0114(0079)]
I had assumed that the humans stopped making the Reins of Unity because they had lost their faith in me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
But it was because I lost the power to grow the material needed![VAR 0114(0079)]
I have spent far too long holding my misguided assumptions, it seems.[VAR 0114(0079)]
It has been many centuries since I was able to grow a radiant flower. Doing so drains much of my power.[VAR 0114(0079)]
But for whatever reason, a fraction of my power seems to have returned to me just now![VAR 0114(0079)]
There is only one thing to be done! Let the radiant flower bloom![VAR 0114(0079)]
Crownus bloomus![VAR 0114(0079)]
Take this, human child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
*pant pant*[VAR 0114(0079)]
It shames me to admit it, but a whole flower is beyond me right now...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I do not know if that petal will be enough, but I still must ask that you use it to try to create the Reins of Unity.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The descendants of the family who once made the reins for me should still live in the village.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I put my hopes on you, human child...[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Reins of Unity? I feel like the mayor’s family used to make a rope called something like that, but that was a while ago...
If you’re looking to do some research, why not read through the books at the mayor’s house?
You want to make a set of reins? Well, the mayor’s pretty good at making things. He even made the village’s signature shirt!
Huh? The Reins of Unity? Never heard of ’em.
I’ve seen you running around, talking to everyone here in this village. You seem pretty friendly!

Oh, hello again, savior of our village! Come to do some more reading?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Not this time!
I need a favor!
I beg your pardon? You want me to make a set of Reins of Unity?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Well, I say, that presents a bit of a problem.[VAR 0114(007A)]
If my dear great-granddad were still around, he’d have been able to make you a set...[VAR 0114(007A)]
But unfortunately, we’ve no one left who knows the traditional ways at this point.[VAR 0114(007A)]
What’s more, I doubt you have the flower you’d need to forge a set of the reins.[VAR 0114(007A)]
I do have it!
Got a petal, at least!
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Is...is that a petal from a radiant flower?[VAR 0114(007A)]
If so, would that not mean the King of Bountiful Harvests has truly...? No, no! I dare not hope.[VAR 0114(007A)]
If I recall, my ancestors made Reins of Unity by following the ways passed down in fairy tales... There were two key materials—a flower and hairs from a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(007A)]
But I’m afraid those old traditions have long since faded from memory.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Still, how could I refuse a favor to such a kind and helpful guest? The materials, if you please![VAR 0114(007A)]
You handed the tuft of White Mane Hair and the Radiant Petal over to the mayor!
You handed the tuft of Black Mane Hair and the Radiant Petal over to the mayor!
I can’t promise this will turn out as well as the ones my great-granddad would’ve made, but...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Time to breathe life back into the traditions of my village![VAR 0114(007A)]
*click clack* *click clack*
*whirr whirr*
Harrumph![VAR 0114(007A)]
I’m afraid it hasn’t come out well at all.[VAR 0114(007A)]
I fancy myself a crafty enough sort, but I suppose it’d take a craftsman of truly delicate technique to make such fine reins.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Oh, please don’t look so dejected. I’m very sorry. Truly I am.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Oi, Mr. Mayor![VAR 0114(0076)]
The hot water in my shower seems to have gone on holiday![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, yes, terribly sorry. I’ll have a look at it soon.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Oh, you’re here, too, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Were you in the middle of somethin’? The pair of you seem awful gloomy![VAR 0114(0076)]
Here’s what happened...
The mayor tried...
What? Is that all? Gahaaahaha! So, all you need to do is make some nice cord![VAR 0114(0076)]
Pass me those materials for a mo.[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right! Got my petal, got my hair! Now what’m I supposed to do with ’em?[VAR 0114(0076)]
*ahem* If I may be so bold, allow me to share a song that survives from the legends...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Blossom woven round and rooound... ♪ A royal gift in mane’s hair booound... ♪[VAR 0114(007A)]
Steady on, old bloke! The singin’s a bit much! Oh well, that’ll do for an answer.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Hi-yayayaaah![VAR 0114(0076)]
All finished! Have a look! Think this’ll do?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You’re more capable than your face lets on! These Reins of Unity are the spitting image of those in my family’s tales![VAR 0114(007A)]
Gahaaahaha! I don’t sew all my dear rebellious daughter’s clothes for nothin’, you know![VAR 0114(0076)]
Even the explorer’s outfit I gave you was handmade by yours truly, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
*ahem* In any case![VAR 0114(007A)]
It seems you’ve got the Reins of Unity you need.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Isn’t that just smashing![VAR 0114(007A)]
How about it, Chief? Has my sewin’ saved the day?[VAR 0114(0076)]
If he was able to make a set of Reins of Unity... surely that tuft of White Mane Hair and that Radiant Petal must have been genuine? No, impossible. Perish the thought! Hoho.[VAR 0114(007A)]

Would you believe it? I caught myself fallin’ asleep outside again![VAR 0114(0076)]
I was chilled to the bone, so I thought I’d warm myself up with a good, hot shower at our base. But the water comin’ out was ice cold![VAR 0114(0076)]
I got ultra-mega-surprised and jumped out without putting on any of my—[VAR 0114(0076)]
Mlerrrgh...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Human child! Were you able to make the Reins of Unity?[VAR 0114(0079)]
You bet!
Chief Peony did!
Oh joy! What glorious news![VAR 0114(0079)]
Indeed? This man has done so much to aid me... I do hope I can repay him sometime.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I have some good news of my own. I was finally able to track down my loyal steed![VAR 0114(0079)]
Glastrier is making its home in the Crown Shrine! It is a place where my loyal steed and I spent much time together![VAR 0114(0079)]
Spectrier is making its home in the Crown Shrine! It is a place where my loyal steed and I spent much time together![VAR 0114(0079)]
I had been avoiding the place, as I feared I would get trapped in mine own nostalgia...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Why has my loyal steed made the shrine its home? Is it reminiscing about our time together? No, it can’t be.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Crown Shrine stands majestically atop the mountain to the north.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Bring the carrot and the Reins of Unity, and meet me there.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I shall hasten there now, but you may come when you feel you are ready![VAR 0114(0079)]
I am counting on you, child...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I’m afraid we don’t have much to offer you, but you’re welcome to stay for as long as you’d like.
There are a few strange ruins you can find in the Crown Tundra. But the doors won’t budge, whether you push or pull on them!
Head east from the Giant’s Bed and climb up the mountain to the north, and you’ll find an old shrine sitting there.
Be very careful if you’re going to climb the mountain, you hear? The path to the summit is long and treacherous.
Isn’t my Spheal just the roundest thing ever?
I suppose it’s about time I repaired the shower in the village inn...[VAR 0114(007A)]

I have been waiting, human child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Crown Shrine is a place I once called home.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Glastrier must think me helpless now that I have lost my powers. It taunts me by making this place its own dwelling.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Spectrier must think me helpless now that I have lost my powers. It taunts me by making this place its own dwelling.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah... I see you have indeed brought me the Reins of Unity. You have my thanks, child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
You gave the Reins of Unity to Calyrex!
Ahhh... The feeling of holding these again... The color... The way they shine in the light...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Oh, how this brings back memories...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Glastrier is a very proud Pokémon. One might even call it arrogant.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Spectrier is a very proud Pokémon. One might even call it arrogant.[VAR 0114(0079)]
It will not accept me as its master again unless I am able to prove that my power outweighs its own.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I will use the Reins of Unity to pour my power into the very body of my loyal steed.[VAR 0114(0079)]
That should convince it that I am indeed still deserving of its loyalty![VAR 0114(0079)]
Now, human child, in order to lure my loyal steed to me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
place the Iceroot Carrot into the basket near where Glastrier’s made its bed.[VAR 0114(0079)]
place the Shaderoot Carrot into the basket near where Spectrier’s made its bed.[VAR 0114(0079)]

Do you want to place the Iceroot Carrot?
Do you want to place the Shaderoot Carrot?
The time has come, human child![VAR 0114(0079)]
But you have successfully defeated my loyal steed once already...[VAR 0114(0079)]
It will not willingly approach anyone it considers to be a threat.[VAR 0114(0079)]
We must hide and wait for it to appear![VAR 0114(0079)]

Thanks to your efforts, I have been reunited with my loyal steed.[VAR 0114(0079)]
And now I am finally at my full power![VAR 0114(0079)]
I was convinced that the people no longer believed in me... And I had also lost my loyal steed... I was trapped in the throes of deep loneliness.[VAR 0114(0079)]
But you saved me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
There are truly no words with which to fully express my gratitude to you.[VAR 0114(0079)]
So...I have a suggestion.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you are able to catch me even with my powers restored...[VAR 0114(0079)]
it will prove your worth beyond any doubt, and I will lend you my strength on your journey.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Once you have readied yourself, come face me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah, but first...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I should get this man back to where I found him.[VAR 0114(0079)]
It would be no good to let him freeze out in this frigid clime.[VAR 0114(0079)]

Calyrex’s full power is too much to withstand! You can’t even hold on to your Poké Balls!

Do you want to ready your Poké Balls in order to catch Calyrex?

Human child... No, I should refer to you by your name now. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0079)]
I look forward to what adventures we might have together.[VAR 0114(0079)]
*beep beep beep*
Hello? That you, Chief? It’s me—Peony![VAR 0114(0076)]
I just had a dream about a bigheaded Pokémon, talkin’ on and on in a weird shrine...[VAR 0114(0076)]
I just remembered I had a dream a while back about a strange bigheaded Pokémon. It was jabberin’ away at this weird shrine![VAR 0114(0076)]
You were there, too, Chief! It all felt so real![VAR 0114(0076)]
I got worried about you and decided I’d better give you a call and check in![VAR 0114(0076)]
You haven’t hurt yourself, have you, Chief? Not in a bunch of trouble, are you?![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m fine!
Everything’s under control!
Ah, good to hear! Guess I got nothin’ to worry about, then! Gahahaaa![VAR 0114(0076)]
The Peony Exploration Team is all about the safety and well-bein’ of its members, after all![VAR 0114(0076)]
So you be careful on your way back, too, you hear?[VAR 0114(0076)]
No expedition’s over until you’re safe and sound back at home base![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaaahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Better report back to Chief Peony!
Our crops are doing exceptionally well recently! The King of Bountiful Harvests certainly is living up to its name!
Have you seen that massive tree to the south of the village?
Is that big man who’s staying in the inn someone you know? My goodness but he has a voice to match his size! I nearly fainted when he greeted me!
A young professor’s staying at our home. I even got her autograph!
That young professor’s gone home. My Beldum is feeling awfully lonely since it doesn’t have Yamper to play with anymore...
We’ll continue to live here on the Crown Tundra. Even if the king is no longer with us.
Hoho! How’re your legendary adventures going?[VAR 0114(007A)]

Text File : rigel2_main_0210

Huh? Well, how ’bout that, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like that was the last bit of the grand Peony Adven-tour that I had for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoooooo! Now this is an occasion! What’s the word? Ultra-mega-epic![VAR 0114(0076)]
Your passion for all this caught me off guard, Chief...[VAR 0114(0076)]
This whole Adven-tour thing was built out of a load of rubbish I scraped together. Even I had my doubts about the whole thing. But you? You went at it with a ton of energy![VAR 0114(0076)]
You don’t s’pose those Pokémon you caught were really the ones in the legends, do you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I do!
Well, actually...
Nah, actually, never mind. You don’t have to tell me anything![VAR 0114(0076)]
A look at your face tells me everything I need to know, Chief.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I can tell that you must’ve done some ultra-mega-epic explorin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
And whatever you discovered on your way... that’s a special treasure just for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m not about to rain on your parade by bein’ nosy and askin’ silly questions![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, Chief [VAR 0100(0000)]... Thanks for stickin’ around and finishin’ every part of my Adven-tour![VAR 0114(0076)]
I want you to have this. Consider it my way of sayin’ “thank you”![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm... But I can’t shake the feelin’ I’m forgettin’ somethin’...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Ugh. Daaad! People can hear you all the way outside, you know![VAR 0114(0078)]
My darlin’ Nia![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh! This place isn’t bad! So this is where you’re staying?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Fancy meetin’ you outside the Max Lair for once![VAR 0114(0078)]
Yeah, it’s been a while!
What took you?
Hehe! You’re really on my wavelength.[VAR 0114(0078)]
Heh, yeah, sorry for all that![VAR 0114(0078)]
So you actually kept my old man company! Cheers, I owe you one![VAR 0114(0078)]
I’ve had my fill of Dynamax Adventures now...[VAR 0114(0078)]
So I thought I may as well try one of those what-d’you-call-’em tours my old man was going on about.[VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh? What? Why’d everyone suddenly go quiet?[VAR 0114(0078)]
H-hold on! Gimme just a mo! I’ll come up with some new legends straightaway![VAR 0114(0076)]
You’ll have your adventure, Nia! A nice father-daughter expedition! Finally![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait one second! You’ll “come up with” legends?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Also, that’s way too close! I need some personal space here![VAR 0114(0078)]
R-right! First things first! I’ve got something for you, Nia...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Here! I made this brilliantly shiny explorer’s outfit for you! You can get changed while I come up with somethin’.[VAR 0114(0076)]
What in the world?! Are you trying to turn me into a disco ball or something?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Why have I got to wear this golden one when yours is normal?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Gahahaha! Isn’t it obvious? You’re my darlin’ daughter![VAR 0114(0076)]
I want you to shine so bright that everyone notices you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ugh! It’s things like this![VAR 0114(0078)]
I’ve changed my mind! Here—you can have this![VAR 0114(0078)]
Hey! But why?![VAR 0114(0076)]
You got a [VAR FF00(0008)]Gold Expedition Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I’m heading back to my own adventure! Time to catch some more Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0078)]
No! Come back, Nia![VAR 0114(0076)]
No need to be so rebellious! I know you really love me! Don’t you?![VAR 0114(0076)]
Agh! Sorry for the sudden commotion, Chief! It was a blast explorin’ with you![VAR 0114(0076)]
You’re free to keep usin’ our base camp, of course![VAR 0114(0076)]
Anyway, time for me to go spend some quality time with my darlin’ daughter![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hold on, Nia! Wait for me![VAR 0114(0076)]

Hey there, Chief! Thanks for stoppin’ by![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m finally gettin’ a little quality family time with my darlin’ Nia.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmm? I dropped something at base camp?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is that really mine? I don’t recall ever writin’ it...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmm? Hang on—isn’t that the Max Lair there in that clue?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Waaagh!
Huh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
What happened?!
Creatures! A horde of creatures appeared inside the Max Lair! And we don’t know if they’re Pokémon!
What?!
Has something caused alien beings to appear? And is this somehow connected to that Ultra Wormhole that opened up briefly in the sky?
Well, sounds like some new, crazy thing’s afoot![VAR 0114(0076)]
And you know what that means, Chief! Bet you a new expedition’s approachin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
And I know just what to call this one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ha! How d’you like that one, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Anyway, for now, there’s your goal: catch the Pokémon—or whatever— in the photo on that odd clue! Now get pumped for some more adventurin’![VAR 0114(0076)]

Moves that only select Pokémon can learn... They are called ultimate moves. Do you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon to learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you’re with can learn my move! That’s too bad!
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
An Egg... I can’t teach my move to an Egg.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
Which move should be forgotten?
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)] [VAR 0102(0000)] forgot [VAR 0107(0001)]! And it learned [VAR 0107(0002)] instead![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
An ultimate move... How you handle its overwhelming destructive power and its aftermath will be the key!
I’m devoting what’s left of my life to helping young Trainers grow. I’d like to teach the ultimate moves to as many successors as I can. Is it all right to teach them to your Pokémon, too?
Would it be all right if I taught your Pokémon the ultimate moves?
Young Trainer, the Pokémon with you can’t learn these moves. Please thoroughly check the list of Pokémon that can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, feel free to come visit me any time you want.
Well, please tell me which Pokémon I should teach.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon can’t learn an ultimate move. Please thoroughly check the list of Pokémon that can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, I can’t teach a move to an Egg.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon’s bond with you is not yet strong enough. It can learn the move once it forms a strong bond with you.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon already knows the ultimate move.
Is it all right to teach [VAR 0107(0001)] to [VAR 0101(0000)]?
Pokémon that can learn the ultimate moves... The blazing Fire-type Pokémon: Charizard, Typhlosion, Blaziken, Infernape, Emboar, Delphox, and Incineroar! The restless Water-type Pokémon: Blastoise, Feraligatr, Swampert, Empoleon, Samurott, Greninja, and Primarina! The quiet Grass-type Pokémon: Venusaur, Meganium, Sceptile, Torterra, Serperior, Chesnaught, and Decidueye! 
Please choose a move that will be replaced with [VAR 0107(0000)].
[VAR 0102(0000)] did not learn [VAR 0107(0001)].

Back at the dojo, you were merely an eyesore— an obstruction blocking the spotlight I so rightfully deserved. Yet reaching this pinnacle alongside you fills me with a certain unexpected pride.[VAR 0114(0072)]
With your raw skill combined with my prodigious psychic powers, the idea that anyone should ever be able to defeat us is positively unimaginable![VAR 0114(0072)]
Ahaha! You know, I really didn’t like you at first, kid. But now that we’ve won this thing... I’m actually happy that I did it together with you![VAR 0114(0071)]
Yes! Did it again! I can’t get enough of this feeling! All you people watching, hope you like your double dose of our toxic teamwork![VAR 0114(0071)]
Woo-hoo! Did you see that, [VAR 0100(0000)]? We won—little old me and you together! I say if you have fun in life, you’ve already won! And nobody out there can beat us in that![VAR 0114(0073)]
Ahhh, the sweet smell of victory! Never gets old, does it? Bet you all these big, flashy wins will have new students swarmin’ to the dojo, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s an ultra-mega-victory for the Peony Exploration Team on the books! Nothing’s quite as satisfyin’ as firin’ off some mighty moves, is it, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oops! Beat ’em all again, have we? Gahaha! You and me, Chief—we’re just plain ultra-mega-unstoppable together![VAR 0114(0076)]
Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s just the kind of fierce battle that gets everyone worked up! I’m proud to have won this thing together with you, Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Typical [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s just what I expected of you by now! It always gets me pumped up when I see how you seem to grow stronger with each battle. Together we’re going to propel all the Trainers in the Galar region to even greater heights![VAR 0114(0004)]
I suppose a win is a win, though it doesn’t sit very well with me that I have to share this victory with you of all people...[VAR 0114(000C)]
This was the only outcome you could have expected with me as your partner, of course. So congratulations on choosing wisely.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], we did it! We beat every single one of ’em![VAR 0114(000D)]
I knew we could do it! You an’ me are gonna win all there is to win! Everybody in Galar is gonna know that we’re the strongest duo around![VAR 0114(000D)]
That’s just like you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! All my Grass-type Pokémon are delighted with this first-place win![VAR 0114(000E)]
Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s our Champion! I always feel a bit stronger when I’ve got you at my side in a battle.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The waves have receded, and only you and I are left standing... Congratulations on this victory, [VAR 0100(0000)]. And thank you for it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The raging wave crashes again! As long as we’re partnered up, I can’t imagine any wave we couldn’t ride together.[VAR 0114(000F)]
A fine performance, [VAR 0100(0000)]! We’ve claimed victory here together! I could almost combust with joy, and I’m already looking forward to our next match together![VAR 0114(0010)]
We burned brightly in this latest tournament as well! I thank you for choosing me to battle beside you once again, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hey, winnin’ with you’s not bad. D’you think the crowd wants an encore? I wouldn’t mind makin’ an exception to my rule, just this once.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So we won again? I mean, sure, that’s real nice and all. I’m happy. But I’ve had my time as a Gym Leader already. Winnin’ too much now would be overkill, innit?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That was a great victory. Just right for keeping up my image as the great Raihan! Now, time for one great selfie to capture it! Smile already, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
When you put the greatest Trainers together, the only thing they can’t do is lose! At this rate, we might just end up making history. Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Strike a pose! We’ve got to capture this moment for the future![VAR 0114(0017)]
We did it... We have won the tournament! I can stand tall knowing that we were able to give all that we had together in this fight.[VAR 0114(0011)]
We did it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Our breathing was more in sync than ever. If you’d like, we should battle alongside one another again sometime.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I enjoyed that tournament quite a bit. The way that you battled, [VAR 0100(0000)]... That’s what makes you worthy to be my partner.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Nothing surprising about this outcome, when you consider how strong the two of us are. If you want, I don’t mind continuing to help you out with racking up these wins.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! W...we won! Th-this is... This is amazing![VAR 0114(0012)]
I...I’m so glad, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I’d be happy to partner with you...anytime![VAR 0114(0012)]
What a strong performance all around! This victory was a true team effort. Now, just remember—even if we’re on opposite sides next time, don’t you hold back one jot![VAR 0114(0015)]
Hee! Looks like we went and won again! Seems like you might grow rather attached to having me as a partner if this carries on, hmm?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Quite what I’ve come to expect of you, my liege: seizing victory even while carrying my weight! Loath as I am to enjoy this thrill without my dear younger brother...I am delighted from my toes to the tip of my hair![VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well... I’m afraid it can no longer slip my notice! The way that you continue to choose me as your partner in victory... You’ve come to most ardently admire me, haven’t you, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0068)]
How magnificent—seizing victory even while towing my humble self along for the ride! You, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)], deserve to be crowned Global Celebrity of the Year![VAR 0114(0069)]
The way that you’ve chosen me to share in your victories time and again... Young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)], are you perhaps the champion of being too fond of me? Forgive me, Older Brother, but only one of us can monopolize [VAR 0100(0000)]’s favor— and it’s me![VAR 0114(0069)]
Being able to beat everyone else together with my rival [VAR 0100(0000)]... I’m gonna ride this high to really crush my studies and become a great professor! Just you watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
Getting to win this thing together with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]—it’s the best every time! And [VAR 0101(0001)] seems to be on cloud nine, too, getting to battle alongside you! Heh heh... Thanks for giving us both this chance![VAR 0114(0005)]
Congratulations, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady. Though teaming up with you always makes me put on a grander show than I’d planned. Still...I have to admit I had fun. You’d think I’d have outgrown this kind of thing by now! It seems I’m quite beyond help in that regard.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Congratulations are in order...or are they indeed, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady? Are you sure this is what you want—sharing the spotlight of victory with an old crone like me? Oh, you are, are you? Hmph... Perhaps you’re starting to get a bit pink yourself, after all...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Marnie![VAR 0114(0004)]
I offer you my heartfelt congratulations on your victory in the Galarian Star Tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]
I set up this tournament so that Trainers could work together and push each other to greater heights as they battle...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And it’s turned out to be an even greater success than I ever thought it would be![VAR 0114(0004)]
You were amazing!
Thank you! Both of you! Our new Champion and our old one!
All the matches were brilliant!
You hear that? The voices of Galar... The excitement we brought all those people...[VAR 0114(0004)]
They can’t help but be moved by that fantastic performance you two just put on! Their hearts are crying out for more![VAR 0114(0004)]
And this glorious tournament that’s brought so much fire to the people of Galar... Well, its time is up. We have our clear winners.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Though it’s an awful shame to have to end it, after all the fun it’s been...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Which is why...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m pleased to announce that the Galarian Star Tournament will continue from this day on![VAR 0114(0004)]
Whoaaa! Whaaaat?!
You mean there’ll be more matches?! That’s the best news we’ve had all year!
You can have as many tournaments in this Multi Battle format as you can stomach![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you want, you can stick with the same partner next time—or try something different![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll get all the strongest Trainers in the Galar region into this wild mix...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And we’ll run wild next time! And the next! And every time after that![VAR 0114(0004)]
As long as Trainers and Pokémon keep aiming for the top together![VAR 0114(0004)]
As long as our fans want to watch our battles, their hands sweaty with nerves and excitement![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll go on for a thousand years! We’ll carry on forever![VAR 0114(0004)]
So, everyone! Until we next meet![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now let’s have the Maximizers play us off![VAR 0114(0004)]
Shauuu!
Woo-hoo! All right!

Do you know the Pokémon Furfrou? If you have one, I’ll trim it for you for 500!
Knock it off! You don’t have 500!
Knock it off! You don’t have Furfrou with you!
OK. Which Furfrou do you want me to trim?
Choose a style. I’ll give your Furfrou an awesome trim!
Heart Trim
Star Trim
Diamond Trim
Debutante Trim
Matron Trim
Dandy Trim
La Reine Trim
Kabuki Trim
Pharaoh Trim
Back to natural
Never mind
Leave it to me. I’ll take 500 for the trim first.
OK. Let’s get started. ...Come here, dear Furfrou. ♪
Snip...[WAIT 5] Snip...[WAIT 5] Awwwwwwwww. ♪ Furfrou. ♪ You’re so adorable and cute. ♪
Aww... ♪ Furfrou, you’re super lovely. ♪ ...You think so, too, right?
If you want to try out a different style, come back any time.
Want me to trim Furfrou a bit to maintain its [VAR 0194(0000)]?
Want me to return your Furfrou to its natural look, huh?
Knock it off! I can’t trim an Egg!
I only feel love for Furfrou. I won’t trim any other Pokémon!
Hmmm? Hmmm? That won’t change anything, though.
Poodle Pokémon with fluffy fur... My fingers are itching to trim Furfrou so bad.

It’s my solemn duty to teach a move to Mythical Pokémon. Although I’m on vacation, I could teach a move to your Mythical Pokémon. What do you say?
Whoa! Your Pokémon already knows the move I can teach!
What a shame! I could teach a move if you were with Keldeo or Meloetta.
I could teach a move to your Mythical Pokémon. What do you say?
Speak to me again if you change your mind.
Even I can’t teach my moves to an Egg!
That Pokémon cannot learn the moves I can teach!
Hmm? That Pokémon already knows the move I can teach!
Hmmm. That Pokémon doesn’t seem to have the energy to battle...

Oh! That’s an Armor Pass! With that pass, you can go to the Isle of Armor.
You have a Crown Pass, too! You can also go to the Crown Tundra.
Where would you like to go to today?
Armor Station
Crown Tundra Station
Never mind
I’m sorry, but please speak to me again once you have access to the Wild Area.
I’m sorry, but you don’t seem to have a pass.
Oh? It seems there is some kind of problem. Please check your pass and speak to me again.

Moves that only select Pokémon can learn... They are called battle-combo moves. Do you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon to learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you’re with right now can learn my move. That’s too bad!
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
An Egg... I can’t teach my move to an Egg.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
Which move should be forgotten?
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)] [VAR 0102(0000)] forgot [VAR 0107(0001)]! And it learned [VAR 0107(0002)] instead![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
Battle-combo moves... How you combine them with each other is the key to using them well!
Did you get a Pokémon from the island kahuna or professor, maybe? It doesn’t matter if it’s evolved into something else since then. As long as it’s a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type Pokémon that new Trainers are given around here, and it’s really friendly toward you, I’ll teach it a special move—a battle-combo move.
A special move... Shall I teach your Pokémon a battle-combo move?
There is no move that I can teach to any of the Pokémon you are with...
I see... Well, see you next time.
Which Pokémon will it be, then?
That Pokémon can’t learn a move from me.
Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?! You are being unreasonable.
This Pokémon... It doesn’t look like it’s too comfortable with you yet.
That Pokémon already knows one of my moves.
Do you want me to teach [VAR 0101(0000)] [VAR 0107(0001)]?
My favorite Pokémon are all the Pokémon you get from people like professors or kahunas. I teach special moves—battle-combo moves—to those Pokémon and the Pokémon that evolve from them. That’s what I do!
Please choose a move that will be replaced with [VAR 0107(0000)].

To be pitted against the two of us from the outset spells certain tragedy for our opponents![VAR 0114(0072)]
Shall I overwhelm them with my powerful psychic powers? Why yes, I think I shall![VAR 0114(0072)]
Now now... I caution you not to make Avery pull a Teleport on you![VAR 0114(0072)]
Shall we offer our next opponents a taste of deepest despair, then?[VAR 0114(0072)]
The true victory lies in winning with the utmost elegance.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Now is the time, Avery! We shall not let victory slip through our fingers![VAR 0114(0072)]
So the first trick is just to rack up a win, right?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Seems like a great chance to show off just how toxic we can be![VAR 0114(0071)]
Remember how I poured poison all over our last opponents? Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll do that again![VAR 0114(0071)]
Doesn’t matter who we’re up against! They’ll all get a toxic dose of Klara and [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0071)]
Stand aside, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I got this one![VAR 0114(0071)]
We’re gonna win this match... Ain’t nobody gonna stop us![VAR 0114(0071)]
The first step is the most important one! Let’s make it a huge step![VAR 0114(0073)]
So many Galarian stars in this tournament! This should be fun![VAR 0114(0073)]
The next opponent looks strong, too! How exciting![VAR 0114(0073)]
Don’t hold back, dear [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s put on a show for them![VAR 0114(0073)]
I can’t imagine losing when I’m teamed up with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
All right, this is the final boss, as they say! Let’s do our best, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Can you imagine if we lost in the first match? Sounds downright embarrassin’, eh, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right! Time to go all in for victory, Chief [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hey, what match was this again? Might have lost track a bit...[VAR 0114(0076)]
My little Nia’s watching, too. Papa can’t afford to look bad now![VAR 0114(0076)]
Right then, Chief! Let’s wrap this up and seize that sweet, sweet victory![VAR 0114(0076)]
Right! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let’s turn this match up to eleven... Really put on a show for the crowd![VAR 0114(0004)]
Double Champions means we’re going to have a doubly champion time! Starting now![VAR 0114(0004)]
Whichever side has the greater passion for victory is the side that will win.[VAR 0114(0004)]
No need to be shy or nervous. Let’s just do what we always do![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re the best team in this tournament... I say it’s time we prove it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Nobody can defeat us when we’re teamed up together, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll appreciate it if you do your best. That way, I can shine even brighter by comparison.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Pink is all well and good, I suppose, but I think I’ll cover you in the color of Bede![VAR 0114(000C)]
Please don’t let your guard down just because you’re the Champion.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You can leave this to me, you know. Just stand by and watch a master do his work.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I hope the victory celebrations are being prepared properly for us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I will not settle for second place, understand? It would be a disgrace, especially when I’m with you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s show ’em our teamwork![VAR 0114(000D)]
We’re gonna win this...together![VAR 0114(000D)]
All my mates from Spikemuth are cheerin’ us on![VAR 0114(000D)]
Toss your Poké Ball on my mark, OK? Are you ready?[VAR 0114(000D)]
This is it... The last big match. Hey, d’you need me to cheer you on a bit?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m trustin’ you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
In both battles and farming, it’s the first soil you lay down that matters the most![VAR 0114(000E)]
Well then, shall we get this haystack rolling, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Just battling with you seems to perk my Grass-type Pokémon right up![VAR 0114(000E)]
I think you and I can harvest a victory from the second battle, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The two of us working together can tear out any opponent by the roots![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s make our teamwork blossom into a beautiful victory![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s direct the flow of this tournament our way by snagging one win for starters.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Don’t worry. I won’t let anyone sink our team![VAR 0114(000F)]
That’s it! We’ve got the tide on our side, so now all we need to do is go with the flow![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m at my best when I team up with you! It’s like I’m a mermaid who’s found water![VAR 0114(000F)]
We’ve made it this far, so let’s keep going to the finish line. Don’t let your guard down![VAR 0114(000F)]
Even if I have to flood this stadium and turn it into an ocean, I’ll swim my way through![VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s go, Champion! Time to set the stadium on fire![VAR 0114(0010)]
This is the very first match, and I can already sense that sparks are going to fly! Watch out for burns![VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t let our victory go to your head. The next opponent’s going to be strong![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hustle, hustle, hustle, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You can do it, you can do it, Kabu! ...Sorry.[VAR 0114(0010)]
This is the final battle! Don’t burn out until the very end![VAR 0114(0010)]
We can win this! We can reach the top! We’ve got this, OK?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Well then, let’s get this show on the road.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hope you’re ready to fling that Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Time for round two.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t worry ’bout me. I’ll get nice and amped up once the battle starts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I guess the top of the pile ain’t a bad spot to aim for.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s give this crowd somethin’ to cheer about![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s show them just how good we are, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s keep the crowd’s eyes riveted on us![VAR 0114(0017)]
Whoa! Almost got ready to throw out two Poké Balls. Force of habit![VAR 0114(0017)]
I might change the weather, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Don’t hate on me if I do![VAR 0114(0017)]
Galar will see soon enough which side is the better team![VAR 0114(0017)]
The great Raihan is an unstoppable force, racking up victories! Don’t get left behind![VAR 0114(0017)]
The battle is about to start. Ready yourself.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s do our best together, hand in hand.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s keep our teamwork honed sharp for the second round.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The opponents won’t be pushovers. Let’s give them the battle they deserve![VAR 0114(0011)]
This is the final battle. Let’s make sure to have no regrets, whether we win or lose.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Our fists combined should be more than enough to punch through any wall standing in our way![VAR 0114(0011)]
Don’t worry—if things get too dicey, I’ll back you up.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re going to absolutely rock this crowd![VAR 0114(0014)]
Whew! Doing a backflip takes quite a bit of focus, you know.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re going to win this one, too. You got that, Champion?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Just battle like you always do. Victory will come naturally![VAR 0114(0014)]
Let’s grab first place for all our fans![VAR 0114(0014)]
I-I’m ready...[VAR 0114(0012)]
S-so many people... I’m a bit scared, but I’ll do my best![VAR 0114(0012)]
C-come on, my Ghost-type Pokémon... Lend your strength to [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m c-counting on you for this battle, too...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Th-this is it... I think we can do it![VAR 0114(0012)]
Y-you can do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I...I believe in you![VAR 0114(0012)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s win this, nice and cool![VAR 0114(0015)]
Come on now! Back straight! Chin up! Yes, that’s the posture of a Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
They may be all fired up for battle, but we’ll freeze them solid—passion and all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, which Pokémon do you think I should knock out first?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You and I, we can do this! One of them’s all yours, love![VAR 0114(0015)]
One more battle, and we’ve got this in the bag! We can do this together![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let us show these plebeians our noble skills![VAR 0114(0068)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], my liege! I swear on my honor—I will not fail you![VAR 0114(0068)]
If it truly comes to it, you may use my splendid hair as a sword![VAR 0114(0068)]
This next opponent will not cause us any trouble, I’m sure. We might even have time for tea![VAR 0114(0068)]
If we win, I’ll be sure to give my dear brother a full account of our marvelous deeds![VAR 0114(0068)]
If we win this, it will be undeniable that we are the best team out there![VAR 0114(0068)]
Let us show the crowd the power of true celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], my liege! Allow me to prove my worth![VAR 0114(0069)]
I hope that my hair shield will be enough to protect you...[VAR 0114(0069)]
This next opponent should be a piece of cake! I wish we could have a cup of tea to go with it.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Oh, my dear brother will be so jealous if we win this one![VAR 0114(0069)]
With our celebrity powers combined, final triumph should be but a trifle![VAR 0114(0069)]
First things first! Let’s pick up some momentum![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t let the new Hop surprise you, mate! You can count on me![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can’t lose now! Time to bring out the full strength of our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s time for the Postwick dream team to show people what we can do![VAR 0114(0005)]
Scoring a win together would really make my day, mate! Let’s do our best![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can win this, mate! We can’t lose now![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s turn this stadium pink, shall we?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d love to toss in a quiz or two, but... I guess this isn’t the time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Try to keep up, dear pink-lacking Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll show everyone that they don’t call me “the wizard” for nothing. And everyone includes you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, so they’re our next opponents? This should be fun.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If we win this, I might just have to make a comeback...[VAR 0114(0013)]

And my efforts were rewarded gloriously! You are looking at the chosen leader of the Psychic Gym![VAR 0114(0072)]
That’s amazing!
Congratulations!
Feel free to keep heaping on the praise and adoration! It really is a fantastic achievement! Even if our Gym is still in the minor division.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Well, our Gym is still in the minor division. But you can feel free to praise me some more. It’s perfectly deserved, of course.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Th...that really is amazing! I hope you’ll keep working toward reaching the major division![VAR 0114(0005)]
Th...that really is amazing! I hope you’ll keep working toward reaching the major division![VAR 0114(0005)]
H-Hoppy-kins...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hop...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well, you can bet your bottom I’ll be going all out in this event! Just you wait and see![VAR 0114(0071)]
Rest assured that I will bring my best performance to this competition. I will be a fearsome challenger to face down![VAR 0114(0072)]
Suddenly I’m feeling all fired up for this thing! If everyone’s taking it that seriously, I don’t want to be the one to lose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hee hee! Don’t worry—I’ll knock you out nice and cold![VAR 0114(0071)]
Just what I like to hear![VAR 0114(0072)]
All right, everyone! Sorry to have kept you waiting![VAR 0114(0004)]
First things first—I want to say a quick thank-you to all of you for coming running when I called![VAR 0114(0004)]
I really wanted to explain this in person, because I wanted to be sure I could get across to you all how great this idea is![VAR 0114(0004)]
Phew, would you take a look at this guy? Getting all serious on us in your old age, are you? What is this grand idea anyway, Leon?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hah! Don’t you start in on me, Raihan! I’m really trying here![VAR 0114(0004)]
See, I’ve spent my whole life battling with myself to try to become the greatest Trainer...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And then I saw how [VAR 0100(0000)] grew so strong by competing against my little brother, Hop...and how much it made Hop grow, too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It really proved to me how much further you can go when you’re battling against a proper rival![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hrmph...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And now that I’ve taken over running the League from Chairman Rose...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m thinking I want to bring even more thrilling battles to our wonderful Galar region![VAR 0114(0004)]
So for both these reasons, I’ve called you all here today to tell you that...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m declaring the Galarian Star Tournament open![VAR 0114(0004)]
The Galarian Star what?![VAR 0114(000D)]
*sigh* Doesn’t he ever tire of draggin’ other people into his nonsense?[VAR 0114(0016)]
The Galarian Star Tournament will be an elimination tournament in Multi Battle format![VAR 0114(0004)]
I want all of you here to pair up with the strongest partner you can think of...[VAR 0114(0004)]
then pool your power and work together to try to win your way through the tourney![VAR 0114(0004)]
YEAHHHH!
You should find someone to partner with for the tournament...

That’s Lee for you! He knows how to start off a tournament nice and proper![VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, I wasn’t expecting to have to team up with someone... Oh, I know![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! If you haven’t settled on a partner yet, why not team up with me?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Aw, that’s too bad... Well, let me know if you change your mind, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
Nobody’s going to be able to stop this team! We’re sure to win this tournament. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
C’mon, mate! Let’s head to reception so we can get all registered![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Oh, you’ve already settled on a partner?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Galarian Star Tournament, huh? Sounds like my shot to see how good I’ve got.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Huh? Are you still lookin’ for a partner, too?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, if you haven’t settled on anyone, why don’t we team up, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh, OK... That’s too bad. I bet we’d make a smashin’ team![VAR 0114(000D)]
Rockin’! It’s decided, then! I’ve only got eyes for first place, you hear? Nothin’ else is gonna cut it![VAR 0114(000D)]
Let’s head over to reception and get signed up.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’ve already picked out a partner, huh?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’ve decided to team up with Nessa. If you run into us during the tournament, no need to hold anything back![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m sure it would be fun to battle alongside you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. But...I’m sorry. I’ve already settled on a partner.[VAR 0114(000F)]

I’ve already chosen my partner. Forgive me, but allow me to remain your opponent this time—and let the sparks fly![VAR 0114(0010)]
Finding the perfect partner to compensate for your own weaknesses... In that sense, this battle has already begun. I don’t plan to lose.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wh-wh-wh-what?! M-m-me?! Partner with...you?! D-doesn’t that seem a bit sudden?! I...I don’t think... No, I c-couldn’t possibly...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Partner with you? Why would I do that? I can’t crush you in battle if we’re on the same side, now, can I?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Having you battling beside me would be as heartening as anything could be... But I’d rather face you as a rival, Champion.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Having you battling beside me would be very heartening, of course... But I’d rather face you as a rival, Champion.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Every time I end up workin’ together with you, I get dragged into some kind’a awful mess. I think I’m good on disasters for the moment. I’ll pass on bein’ your partner this time.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 37]
We ask that everyone remain until all the teams have been decided and registered properly!
What’s that?! You’d like to have an absolute ball battling alongside your pal, Ball Guy?
Boy, that’s an offer I’d love to roll with... But this is one ball that doesn’t belong in battle!

Looks like our first opponents are Milo and Nessa! Don’t let your guard down, mate... They’re not gonna be pushovers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know we’re on the same side and all, but we’re still rivals, too! I’m not gonna let you outshine me in front of everyone![VAR 0114(000D)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_gst_event_0060
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just our luck to be matched up against the Champion’s team in round one, eh?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Come on, Milo. Don’t tell me you’re throwing in the towel already![VAR 0114(000F)]
Together, I bet we can sweep aside any opponent—even if it’s the Champion![VAR 0114(000F)]
You can say that again! In that case, guess I’d better really put my back into it and show off a little![VAR 0114(000E)]
Don’t get too confident, mate! Me and my Pokémon’ve become a lot stronger since the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re not the only one showin’ off! I’ll show you all the true strength of Spikemuth Gym![VAR 0114(000D)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_gst_event_0070

Battling together with you like this reminds me of our adventure in Rose Tower! I’m gonna go all out to show I can keep up with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not bad, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I can already tell we’re gonna make a smashin’ combo after just one battle as teammates![VAR 0114(000D)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_gst_event_0080
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What an ideal matchup for letting both of us show our strength.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Agreed. We couldn’t have asked for better opponents.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will press onward toward victory with every ounce of strength in my body and soul![VAR 0114(0011)]
Between us, we make a monolith that won’t easily be crushed![VAR 0114(0014)]
Well, just look who we’re up against! Now, Champion, no hard feelings when we win![VAR 0114(0015)]
I...I’m not so g-great with Multi Battles...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Allister! No whining! Now’s the time to stand tall—understood?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’ll...I’ll try my best.[VAR 0114(0012)]
These two aren’t the types of opponents we can afford to take lightly... But we’re no strangers to bringing our A game! We can do this, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pretty odd team they make, isn’t it? Still, they could turn out to be a good combo in their own right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Fighting types make a pretty rough matchup for me... Can I just leave ’em to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m right at home takin’ on Ghost types! Just leave ’em to me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]

This is it, mate! We’re knocking on the door of the final battle! And we’re up against Raihan and Lee, of all people... But when we stand together, [VAR 0100(0000)], we’ve got nothing to be afraid of![VAR 0114(0005)]
So here we are at the final battle. Took long enough, but we made it, eh? My bro and Raihan ain’t gonna just hand us a win, though—that’s for sure... But listen. I’ve got your back no matter what, long as you believe in me, too. All right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop! I knew you two’d make it through![VAR 0114(0004)]
From the moment I saw the tourney bracket, I knew this was how things would end up, Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Haha! Well then, here we are...facing off in the final round![VAR 0114(0004)]
This match’ll settle who’s the strongest team... So let’s give it all the effort it deserves![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve gotta say, I’d still rather win this thing by beating you, Leon...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But if it means schooling these two, then maybe teaming up with you isn’t too bad, either![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! We’re gonna win, even if we have to pry victory right from the hands of Lee’s team![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] and Marnie, eh? You’re gonna be one pain of a pair to battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve been waitin’ for a chance to show you how strong Spikemuth’s new Gym Leader is, Bro! Finally, I get to let you see firsthand![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh, I’m well aware how strong you’ve got. But I’m still your big brother. You get how it is.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Now bring it, Sis! Get ready to get crushed down to dust![VAR 0114(0016)]
I was really hoping for a chance to finally beat Leon...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But I don’t mind missing that chance if it means I get to beat these two![VAR 0114(0017)]
No holdin’ back, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You an’ me are gonna come out on top![VAR 0114(000D)]

Let me guess! You want me to teach Dragon Ascent to your Pokémon. Am I correct?
You don’t seem to have Rayquaza—the only Pokémon that can learn Dragon Ascent.
Come back any time you need my help.
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach the move to?
That Pokémon can’t learn Dragon Ascent. Only Rayquaza can learn the move.
I’ve never heard of an Egg that can use Dragon Ascent!
That Rayquaza has already learned Dragon Ascent.
Do you want me to teach Dragon Ascent to that [VAR 0101(0000)] of yours?
Dragon Ascent is a powerful move that only Rayquaza can use. They say its power is so strong that even a huge meteoroid can be broken into pieces with one attack.
Please choose a move that will be replaced with [VAR 0107(0000)].
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]

[VAR 0102(0000)] did not learn [VAR 0107(0001)].

Those with an Armor Pass, please board the train.

Do you have an Armor Pass?
Hee hee! Of course! I totally have one![VAR 0114(0042)]
Naturally. I have made all the proper preparations, which you can observe with unclouded eyes.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Please allow me to check your pass.
Slooo...
Oh, a Slowpoke![VAR 0114(0042)]
Hmph. To meet a Slowpoke... Such a thing is simply elegant.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Uh-oh, looks like another one’s gotten on the train and ridden over from the Isle of Armor.
Is this the first time you’ve seen a Galarian Slowpoke? The coloring of the top of its head is curry-like. Isn’t it superduper cute?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Could this be your first time ever seeing a Galarian Slowpoke? Where they’re from might be different, but they’re still just as carefree as other Slowpoke.[VAR 0114(0042)]
There’s a lot of Slowpoke living on the Isle of Armor. Not sure if they feel like traveling or what, but sometimes a few board the train.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel_other_jizen_0030
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Slooo?
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, right?
If Slowpoke blocks the ticket gate, it’ll cause trouble for other customers.
Slowpoke are actually pretty heavy... So, do you think you could catch it for me?
Slooow.
Battle Slowpoke in order to catch it?
Slowww?!
[~ 7]
Huh? Slowpoke still hasn’t stopped blocking the ticket gate?
Looks like defeating Slowpoke isn’t enough. The only way is to catch it!
Huh? You know that if you run away, then you won’t be able to catch it, right?
To catch a Pokémon, you first need to weaken it. Then throw a Poké Ball!
Slo?!
Thanks much! Slowpoke can be a big trouble to move sometimes.
Wow! Amazing![VAR 0114(0042)]
Hmmm? How interesting...[VAR 0114(0042)]
The way you caught that Slowpoke was the absolute coolest.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I must say, your catching style was quite simply elegant.[VAR 0114(0042)]
We apologize for the wait. We have checked your Armor Pass.
All aboard the train to the Isle of Armor. Mind your step when boarding. Please be aware that there will be a connection along the way.
Okaaay.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Understood.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m heading to a place called the Isle of Armor. I’m gonna catch some rare Pokémon and do some training.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I am headed to an island called the Isle of Armor. I’ve heard it’s a place where one can catch rare Pokémon and do lots of training.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Let’s hang if we meet up again, ’K? Bye-bye, then! See ya![VAR 0114(0042)]
Perhaps we shall meet again sometime. Well then, please excuse me.[VAR 0114(0042)]

Oi oi, Chief! Got something legendary to show me?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Have a look!
Let’s battle!
Never mind
Aha, changed your mind? Fair enough![VAR 0114(0076)]
What’ve you got for me?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Hold the phone, Chief. You haven’t got any Legendary Pokémon with you! Gahaha! It happens![VAR 0114(0076)]
[VAR 0101(0001)]
[VAR 0101(0002)]
[VAR 0101(0003)]
[VAR 0101(0004)]
[VAR 0101(0005)]
[VAR 0101(0006)]
Never mind
Oh? Don’t feel like showing me anything legendary after all? Gahaha! It happens![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha! That’s Mewtwo, the ferocious Pokémon created through genetic manipulation, isn’t it? Its face is a bit on the pale side... Seems docile for the most part, though! It might not have the friendliest-lookin’ mug, but I’ll bet you it’s a decent sort on the inside![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho, here it is! Our imposter Articuno! I always wonder what it’s thinkin’ in there behind that dodgy mask... D’you get the feelin’ it’s lookin’ down its beak at us? Maybe it’s my imagination.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! It’s our imposter Articuno, only without that dodgy mask! Bet you it gets a lot more fans with those sharp, bright eyes out in the open, eh? Hang on, though—has it gotten chilly in here? Did a blizzard blow in or somethin’?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho, here it is! Our imposter Zapdos! Seems like it’s done its best to be jagged and spiky and make its beak nice and sharp. It really wants to be a proper Zapdos! Full marks for effort![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Looks like you’d get a massive jolt if you laid a finger on this one! Our imposter Zapdos must’ve gotten some static electricity in the old feathers! Static builds up somethin’ fierce when the air gets cold and dry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho, here it is! Our imposter Moltres! It may look a bit like it’s ablaze, but it’s barely lukewarm! That ultra-mega-feisty look in its eyes actually makes me feel like we’d get on all right.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Now those are some serious flames! Hey, imposter Moltres! Have you got a fever or somethin’? You get some rest, hear me? Take care of yourself![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, eh? The one with rainbow-colored wings? There’s red for sure. Some white, some yellow... A few hues short of a rainbow, though, isn’t it? Oh well. I’d hate to crush all your dreams, so I’ll take your word on it, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is the Legendary Pokémon Lugia, eh? The one they call the guardian of the seas? And yet it’s a Flying type! Fancy that—being able to swim and fly! What CAN’T it do? I’ve heard they’ve got these sportin’ events called Pokéathlons in this one far-off region... Bet you Lugia would be brilliant in those![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Raikou, the Pokémon they say descended with a bolt of lightnin’? That must’ve been a pretty rough ride, eh, mate? No wonder the mane on your back’s gone all curly.[VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Entei, the Pokémon they say was born from a volcanic eruption? Born from a volcano? Yeah, sure! Pull the other one; it’s got bells on! So you’re sayin’ its old man’s a volcano? Or what—is its mum a volcano?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Wow! That’s a beautiful Pokémon, that is! Is that Suicune? It’s dead cool how that horn thing on its head sort of makes a loop! I wonder, though... How’s it supposed to roll over when it wants to sleep on the other side? I bet it’s got a rough time sleepin’ in general. You all right, Suicune? Gettin’ your eight hours?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that Groudon? The Pokémon they call the personification of land?! If the stories about how it sleeps in magma are true...that’s brilliant! I’m a regular at the sauna, so I get where it’s coming from! Bet it gets a nice spring in its step after a kip in that magma![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that Kyogre? The Pokémon they say created the seas?! If the ocean’s the mother of all life...and Kyogre’s the mother of the ocean... Should we all be callin’ Kyogre our nan?! Listen up, Chief... You better be nice and gentle with that Kyogre![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh? Rayquaza? Isn’t it supposed to live way up high in the ozone layer? Sounds like some serious high-altitude trainin’! It must be one dedicated athlete! Well, it’s sure got a tough enough look on its face! I dunno what your sport is, Rayquaza, but keep it up![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Latias, a Pokémon that can read people’s minds usin’ telepathy... It’s got a right cute little face for such a powerful Pokémon, hasn’t it? All right, mate, let’s see what you can do! What am I thinkin’ right now? Wait, nope—cancel that! That’s a terrifyin’ idea, now that I think about it![VAR 0114(0076)]
So Latios is supposed to be so dead smart, it can understand human speech? That’s brilliant if it’s true, but I dunno if I believe it... It’s a lot to swallow! Hey, Latios, mate. You’re sorta like a big brother to Latias, right? Well, listen. You be a proper big brother and be good to Latias. Got it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, here’s our little rock giant! Gahaha! Sorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh. Don’t you worry, rock giant—my respect for you’s as thick as those broad shoulders! Keep up the good work, my fine rugged friend![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, here’s our little ice giant! Gahaha! Sorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh. Don’t you worry, ice giant—I can see the might of your massiveness as clear as my reflection on you! Keep up the good work, my fine frozen friend![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, here’s our little steel giant! Gahaha! Sorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh. Don’t you worry, steel giant—your bowling-ball bod gets full marks from me! A perfect strike! Keep up the good work, my fine smooth friend![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Dialga? The Pokémon that controls time? Well, if that’s not just talk...think it could give me a cheeky rewind whenever I make my darlin’ Nia mad? That aside...has this thing got a bangin’ cry or what?![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Palkia? The Pokémon that controls space? Well, if that’s not just talk...I’d sure love it if I could catch up to my dear Peonia instantly when she runs off! Just sayin’! That aside...has this thing got a bangin’ cry or what?![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Giratina? A Pokémon that lives in a world on the reverse side of ours? It must’ve taken ages to get here from clear around the planet! Go on—plop down and have a rest, mate! Then again, looks like it’d be a speedy flier. Maybe a trip like that’s a doddle for Giratina![VAR 0114(0076)]
Uxie, eh? The Pokémon that governs knowledge and intelligence? Brilliant! I might have a few tiny gaps in the brains department... Maybe it could front me some smarts! Please and thank you kindly, O wise and generous Uxie! Hey, what do you know? I feel brainier already! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Mesprit, eh? The Pokémon that brought people emotions? I’ll admit I can get a tad caught up in my own passions now and then... Maybe Mesprit brought me a little too much?! Nah, just having a bit of fun! I may get happier or sadder than other folks... but that just means I’m makin’ the most of life![VAR 0114(0076)]
Azelf, eh? The Pokémon that gives people the willpower to get through sticky situations? Maybe if I had one of these around, I’d be better at draggin’ myself out of bed or cleanin’ up around the house! Sounds like every home needs an Azelf! I’ve got to catch myself one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Heatran, the Lava Dome Pokémon? Hmm... That stout, plump frame... That cheeky look on its face... What an ultra-mega-lovable Pokémon! Where’d you find this treasure? Forget legends—I’d like to have one just to carry around![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that the boss of the legendary giants?! It’s gigantic enough—that’s for sure! One gianty giant! With all these dots, though, I’ve got no idea which ones are actually eyes. Where’s a bloke supposed to look when he’s talkin’ to this one?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, it’s Cresselia! The Pokémon that represents the crescent moon! Pretty, isn’t it? Those archy bits on its back look pretty stiff though, don’t they? How’s the poor thing supposed to sleep on its side? Can it even turn over in bed? I worry about you, Cresselia...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that Pokémon’s tail on fire?! Wait—come again? They say this Pokémon could scorch the world? Well, don’t you look calm for someone carryin’ around a potent Pokémon like that, Chief? That takes backbone, that does! Just watch out you don’t get burned![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! That Pokémon’s cracklin’ with electricity! Wait—come again? They say this Pokémon could blast the world with lightnin’? Well, don’t you look calm for someone carryin’ around a mighty Pokémon like that, Chief? That takes backbone, that does! Just watch out you don’t get zapped![VAR 0114(0076)]
Fwhoo! Brrr! I was wonderin’ why it got freezin’ cold all of a sudden. Guess it’s your work, Kyurem! Aren’t you the silly one, gettin’ frozen by your own cold air! That’s a bit of an odd bod though, innit? Looks a little like there’s places to stick bits on and take ’em off... Whoops, that was rude of me! Sorry about that, Kyurem![VAR 0114(0076)]

Wait, wait, wait! You’re tellin’ me that’s a Legendary Pokémon?! That mug’s a dead ringer for my grumpy old neighbor! So that’s Tornadus, the Cyclone Pokémon, eh? Well, I guess my neighbor doesn’t stir up winds that can blow houses away...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Wait, wait, wait! You’re tellin’ me that’s a Legendary Pokémon?! That mug’s a dead ringer for my grumpy old neighbor! So that’s Thundurus, the Bolt Strike Pokémon? Well, I guess my neighbor doesn’t zoom through the sky, droppin’ lightning everywhere...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Wait, wait, wait! You’re tellin’ me that’s a Legendary Pokémon?! That mug’s a dead ringer for my grumpy old neighbor! So that’s Landorus, the Abundance Pokémon? Think it’s tryin’ to steal the King of Bountiful Harvests’ thunder a bit? They say this fella gives evildoers a thrashin’, right? That bit’s just like my neighbor, too![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s the Life Pokémon, Xerneas? The one that can share eternal life?! That’s brilliant and all, but what’s REALLY brilliant is that set of antlers! Those things are ultra-mega-splendid...but they seem like they’d keep Xerneas from turnin’ over in bed. Is livin’ forever even worth it if you can’t get a good kip in at night?[VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s the Destruction Pokémon, Yveltal? The one that absorbs the life-force of livin’ things?! Looks a bit like the letter Y, doesn’t it? Well, I’d sure like to know “why” Yveltal goes around absorbin’ life-force like that! You can’t go stealin’ a bloke’s life-force without so much as a how-d’you-do![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Zygarde, a Pokémon made up of lots of little cells gathered together... Just goes to show how little bits here and there add up! Makes you more than the sum of your pants, or however that sayin’ goes! Take me, for instance—I get my daily workouts in, and those add up to keep years off this old bloke’s bod! Zygarde’s right clever to have that principle worked out![VAR 0114(0076)]
It’s Solgaleo, the Sunne Pokémon! It practically roars “sun,” doesn’t it? Can it really make the darkest of nights light up like midday? That’s pretty cheeky! Sounds like it’d be a great help on those nights you just don’t want to head home yet, though! Eh? It comes from another world, too?! That’s one fired-up Pokémon![VAR 0114(0076)]
It’s Lunala, the Moone Pokémon! It practically howls “moon,” doesn’t it? Can it really make it dark as night even in the full bright of day? That’s pretty cheeky! Sounds like it’d be a great help on those mornings you need a bit more kip, though! Eh? It comes from another world, too?! That’s one fired-up Pokémon![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this one’s Necrozma, the Prism Pokémon? Looks pretty dark and...un-prism-y, eh? What?! It came from another world, lookin’ for light? Sounds like you just need to get more time out in the sun, Necrozma, mate! Chin up—you’ll be sparklin’ with energy in no time! The picture of prismatic health![VAR 0114(0076)]
Nihilego, eh? The Parasite Pokémon? Whoa! Looks soft and floaty as a dream! Just think how cozy you’d be, havin’ one to rest your head on like a pillow! Y’know, Chief, you did take that lovely pillow I found before... Come on—let me have Nihilego wrap nice and gentle around my noggin for a bit! It’s only fair![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! Just look at the muscles on Buzzwole! That’s one Swollen Pokémon, all right! I don’t mind sayin’ I’m stronger than most, but I’ve got to bow down to your brawn, mate! You and me, Buzzwole—we ought to go get a few reps in sometime! I’ll spot you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Pheromosa, eh? The Lissome Pokémon? Seems ultra-mega-refined! That’s a Pokémon with class! Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Pheromosa! What do you say to a handshake? ... ... ... ... ... ... That...might’ve been the coldest shoulder I’ve ever got. Did I do somethin’ wrong, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
It’s Xurkitree, the Glowing Pokémon! What’s it playin’ at, being so pointy?! Looks a bit like it’s got plugs on its limbs... Does it light up if you plug it into a socket? I bet it’d look smashin’! Actually...cancel that. Just the thought of the electric bill I’d get gives me the shivers.[VAR 0114(0076)]
What? Kartana, the Drawn Sword Pokémon? Sure, Chief—pull the other one! I know a piece of origami when I see one. Whoever made this has got an eye for detail, though. There’s serious care in this foldin’! Keep an eye on that—it’d be a right shame if it got blown away in the wind or put through the wash![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gwaaah! That thing’s MASSIVE! Whoops...sorry to shout. Got a bit carried away from the shock! That’s Celesteela, the Launch Pokémon, eh? And it flies around superfast by firin’ flammable gas from those arms? I can’t think of more to say about that than... absolutely wicked! Gotta say though, Chief...the odd ones sure seem to take a shine to you, don’t they?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Guzzlord, the Junkivore Pokémon? Couldn’t have named it better. Look at it go, chowin’ down on that rubbish! Good for you, you great gourmand! No one could call you a fussy eater! Chief, if you’ve ever got some rubbish you can’t be bothered to bin, toss that one a treat![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this Poipole’s a Poison Pin Pokémon that came from another world? Guess it’s got a bit of an unusual face, but it doesn’t look that different from the type of thing I could find in tall grass around here... Gwaaah! Did those needles on its noggin just spray out poison?! Whatever world it came from must be wild![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this Naganadel’s a Poison Pin Pokémon that came from another world? That massive pointy needle sure looks ultra-mega-strong, all right! But, er...how’s it meant to kip with those three needles pokin’ out of its backside? You all right, Naganadel, mate? You gettin’ enough sleep there?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The Rampart Pokémon, Stakataka! That’s one mysterious life-form, all right! Look how many little blocks make up this one Pokémon. They’re just the right size for a pillow too, eh? Wonder if it’d let me have one... Oops! Guess not! Fair enough—losin’ part of your body’s no fun! Come to think of it... How many blocks would it have to lose to not be a Stakataka anymore?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The Fireworks Pokémon, Blacephalon! That’s one mysterious life-form, all right! It’s a funny one to look at with all that wigglin’, isn’t it? Bit less funny to get so desperate you blow up your own noggin, though! Gettin’ the drop on someone’s great and all, but don’t lose your head over it, eh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Who’s this rockin’ the mohawk, Chief? Friend of yours? What? It’s Tapu Koko, a Land Spirit Pokémon that’s the guardian deity of some island?! Hm! Sneakin’ in a bit of undercover travel, is it? Well, not far under cover with that ultra-mega-flash hairdo stickin’ out! Maybe I ought to try out a mohawk if I ever get tired of the ol’ buzz cut![VAR 0114(0076)]
Who’s this rockin’ the perm, Chief? Friend of yours? What? It’s Tapu Lele, a Land Spirit Pokémon that’s the guardian deity of some island?! Hm! Sneakin’ in a bit of undercover travel, is it? Bit small for that, though. Bet its papa’s worried! Guess its family believes in lettin’ its little ones find their own way...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Who’s this rockin’ the horns, Chief? Friend of yours? Oh, it’s Tapu Bulu, a Land Spirit Pokémon that’s the guardian deity of some island?! Hm! Sneakin’ in a bit of undercover travel, is it? Sure looks pleased enough with itself... It...has noticed its horns have poked right through its hat, hasn’t it? Part of me thinks I ought to let it know... but maybe that’s my lack of tact talkin’.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Who’s this rockin’ the eyelashes, Chief? Friend of yours? Oh, it’s Tapu Fini, a Land Spirit Pokémon that’s the guardian deity of some island?! Hm! Sneakin’ in a bit of undercover travel, is it? Hang on... Is it me, or is there loads more moisture in the air all of a sudden? My throat’s feelin’ great now! Cheers, Tapu Fini! They ought to make you the guardian deity of humidifyin’ too![VAR 0114(0076)]
[~ 74]
Aha, here’s our little electric giant! Gahaha! Sorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh. Don’t you worry, electric giant—when I say you look like a great, bright piece of candy, I mean it in the best way! Keep up the good work, my fine crackly friend![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, here’s our little dragon giant! Gahaha! Sorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh. Don’t you worry, dragon giant—I’ve got great respect for clothespins, and you look like the greatest of all! Keep up the good work, my fine pinchy friend![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Glastrier? The King of Bountiful Harvests’ Wild Horse Pokémon? Seems like it’s quit bein’ its old bullyin’ self and is actually bein’ loyal to the king! If I went for a ride on that thing, it might make my legs nice and cool, but I bet I’d get a bit queasy! The King of Bountiful Harvests must have some leg-endary leg strength to stay astride this one![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Spectrier? The King of Bountiful Harvests’ Swift Horse Pokémon? Seems like it’s quit bein’ its old bullyin’ self and is actually bein’ loyal to the king! I get the feelin’ if I went for a ride on that thing, it’d whisk me off to who-knows-where! Bit scary, I don’t mind sayin’! The king’s got to have some legendary guts to ride around on this one all the time![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oi oi! As grand a noggin as ever, eh? That’s our King of Bountiful Harvests, isn’t it? The one callin’ the shots around here! It’s a dead ringer for the statue in Freezington! Hm... Y’know, when I get a good look at it...that head of yours sure looks like my lovely pillow![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho! Calyrex, the King of Bountiful Harvests! It sure does look just like the legends say, ridin’ majestically up on that loyal steed! I’ve got an odd feelin’...like I met it somewhere before you caught it, Chief... But no matter how hard I think about it, I’m just drawin’ a blank! Huh... Did you hear a little voice say “thank you” just now? Or am I hearin’ things?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right! Let’s go a round, then! Get ultra-mega-ready, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! That’s why you’re the chief, Chief! Mighty strong Pokémon you’ve got! Copperajah and the rest look ultra-mega- pleased that they got a chance to cut loose, too![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ha! Chalk another one up for me! Nothin’ feels as ultra-mega-great as leadin’ your own Pokémon in battle, does it? That’s why those Dynamax Adventures are so tough by comparison![VAR 0114(0076)]
Come on now, Chief! We’ve already had us a battle today! I’ve got to let my Pokémon rest up a bit! Try me again tomorrow![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh?![VAR 0114(0076)]
You actually caught a Pokémon by usin’ that mysterious clue?![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let me have a look, would you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s that, anyway... Chief, mind lettin’ me see that Legendary Clue?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gaaahahaha! I didn’t write this clue, Chief...but let’s not let that stop the fun![VAR 0114(0076)]
Erm...excuse me! Where did you find that paper, exactly?!
Chief Peony dropped it...
It was at our base camp...
That’s actually from my notes. I wonder how this could have happened...
Gahahaaa! Haven’t got a single shred of an idea![VAR 0114(0076)]
Indeed, sir. I imagine you haven’t.
Anyway, I’m quite relieved that you found that paper.
Not to mention that you’ve caught Necrozma— the one responsible for that Ultra Wormhole.
Please accept this with my thanks as a reward for your cooperation in my research.
Oh, and no need to worry about returning the paper. I’ve got another copy.
I’ve got to hand it to you, Chief! Only you could track down and catch a thing like that with just a single photo to go on![VAR 0114(0076)]
Still, I’ve got to say... Feels like we’ve come to the end of a chapter or somethin’, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You look ready to keep on goin’ for a while yet, though![VAR 0114(0076)]
Go on then, Chief! Can’t wait to hear about all the exploits and adventures you get up to from here on out![VAR 0114(0076)]
I don’t think that’s the Pokémon from the mysterious clue, Chief! Keep a sharp eye—the game’s still afoot![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmm. This Pokémon certainly looks like the one from that mysterious clue. I’ll give you that... But somethin’ tells me this Pokémon didn’t come from this lair! I know it’s got to be a pain, Chief, but keep searchin’! Slow and steady and all that![VAR 0114(0076)]

Bah! To be defeated in the first battle... Did you use Hypnosis?![VAR 0114(0072)]
A final battle without me on the court is as bland as curry rice without curry![VAR 0114(0072)]
And so you climb on toward victory, leaving us behind. It vexes me, but...bravo.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Aw, c’mon! All that effort, and nothing to show for it?! What a drag...[VAR 0114(0071)]
So you’re moving on to the final battle, huh? Hey, d’you think we could tag along? Pleeease? No...?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Second place is better than no place, so I’m pretty happy![VAR 0114(0071)]
Oof, this is a bit of a disgrace for someone who considers himself your master![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just as strong as ever, aren’t you? Good luck in the final battle![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hee hee hee! That was such a good battle! Congratulations, you two—you’ve earned it![VAR 0114(0073)]
I knew we were in for it when we got put up against you lot in round one, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! Nothing like a head-on battle, am I right? Go get ’em in the next round![VAR 0114(0076)]
Now that was one ultra-mega-heated final battle! Congrats on your win, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
I didn’t expect to be defeated in round one! I bet the crowd’s loving getting such intense battles from the get-go![VAR 0114(0004)]
You triumphed against our full power! Go on to the final battle, then, and show us yet another amazing round![VAR 0114(0004)]
That was a match that’d fit right in at the Champion Cup! Getting the Galarian Star Tournament up and running was definitely a good idea. Thanks again![VAR 0114(0004)]
Not even one victory for us? I can see even the crowd is upset with this improbable turn of events![VAR 0114(000C)]
You defeated us, so you’d better win the final match. I won’t stand for any other result![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, of course I was going to let you win. It wouldn’t do for the Champion to lose like this.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Aw, I wanted to keep battlin’... I guess you win this round, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, you better make sure you win the tournament now—for us![VAR 0114(000D)]
Losin’ almost feels all right since we went all out. Congrats on the win![VAR 0114(000D)]
You sure are a tough opponent, aren’t you? Well, good luck in the next battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
We’ll be cheering you on in the final match from the bleachers, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll be the first to admit we’ve been defeated fair and square. Congratulations on your victory![VAR 0114(000E)]
You’ve cut off our flow before it even got going. No wonder you’re the Champion...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Your teamwork was just flawless! It’s enough to make me a bit jealous.[VAR 0114(000F)]
That was the best final match I could have hoped for. Go on now—give the crowd what they want![VAR 0114(000F)]
Defeat is frustrating, but we can use that feeling to become stronger. Battle us again sometime![VAR 0114(0010)]
We give our burning desire for victory to you! Win the final match for us, OK?[VAR 0114(0010)]
That was a white-hot match, fitting for the final battle of the tournament. Congratulations, you two![VAR 0114(0010)]
Didn’t even make it past the first gig. Marnie’s gonna give me an earful later...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m not gonna use not Dynamaxin’ as an excuse. You two were stronger than us—simple as that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Now that’s what I call strength worthy of a Champion. Go on, then—the crowd’s waitin’![VAR 0114(0016)]
I normally look good even when I lose, but losing in the first round is just too pathetic. The comments on this selfie are gonna be fun...[VAR 0114(0017)]
You defeated the great Raihan! That means you have to win the tournament, you hear?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Whoo, that was a good battle! Guess I have to concede that your team was stronger...for now![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m disappointed, but I’m not going to dwell on it. I wish you the best of luck in the next battle.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I wish you luck in the final round. Show them the same skill you showed to us![VAR 0114(0011)]
Your teamwork was amazing. Congratulations on winning the tournament![VAR 0114(0011)]
This new tournament is something else! You never know what to expect![VAR 0114(0014)]
I wanted to at least make it to the final match, but...your teamwork was better than ours.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I thought we had it in the bag! You can definitely be proud of defeating Team Gordie![VAR 0114(0014)]
Y-you’re too strong... I bet you’ll have no problem in the next match...[VAR 0114(0012)]
The final match won’t be any trouble for you, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I-I know you’ll win![VAR 0114(0012)]
I-I’m glad you were our opponent for the final match, [VAR 0100(0000)]... It’s r-really brilliant how you win these things...[VAR 0114(0012)]
My, you two are better than I thought! Not a bad team at all![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now that’s what I call teamwork. Just keep on doing what you do until you win the whole tournament![VAR 0114(0015)]
I admit, I’d have liked to show off to my son a bit by winning the tournament... But I’ll happily concede to you two![VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, well, well! I expected no less from you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! A performance truly worthy of royalty! I sincerely hope that you climb your way to the throne![VAR 0114(0068)]
Such refreshing strength! Alas, I have no choice but to concede. I am convinced that final victory will be yours![VAR 0114(0068)]
The ones worthy of the final victory are you two, not us! I am sure the whole stadium would agree![VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well! You’re certainly off to a good start! Please make sure to battle with dignity, like my dear brother would![VAR 0114(0069)]
You must make the final match one fitting of celebrities in our stead! Show the people of Galar what feats you are capable of![VAR 0114(0069)]
It is an honor to be defeated by you while on such a glorious stage, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Keep your back straight, and march onward to glory with pride![VAR 0114(0069)]
That’s what I’m talking about, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You bring out the strength of your Pokémon and your partner, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d have looked better losing during the final match, but I guess it is what it is. Still, you won’t get me so easy next time, mate! Good luck on the next match![VAR 0114(0005)]
Congrats on winning the tournament, mate! You two were something else. I’m a bit disappointed in myself, but even more than that...I’m happy for you as my rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
You defeated Team Opal right out of the gate. Now you need to keep winning, you understand?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, I’d hoped we’d be more of a hurdle to you. I guess I’ll have my tea in the stands... Oh, don’t worry. I’ll be cheering for you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Congratulations, child. I can’t think of a better stage for young, fresh talent to really shine.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It seems like you’ve got yourself a good team, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I bet you’ll be able to keep going all the way to the finish line![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aw, fiddlesticks! That’s a drag... Oh well. I’m counting on you to promote the dojo if you win, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], you did it! Congratulations! Hopefully our final match was impressive enough to boost the reputation of the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]

Even Master Mustard can’t stand in the way of our formidable teamwork![VAR 0114(0072)]
Hee hee, that’s the spirit, Avery! I guess I’d better go all out if I want to win![VAR 0114(0073)]
We mustn’t lose to the likes of this lout! He abandoned Psychic types altogether![VAR 0114(0072)]
That’s the only reason you made it as the Psychic Gym Leader. You should be thanking me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
A showdown between two new Gym Leaders! I can’t let you win this one.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’re forgetting that I’m also a leader in elegance, making me undeniably superior.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Ah, I sense in you celebrity-ness much like that within me![VAR 0114(0069)]
And you yourself are quite elegant... Tell me—do you have a Style Card?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh heyyy, Master! We might win by accident... Sorry if that happens![VAR 0114(0071)]
Luck and accidents are all part of the battle! Don’t hold back. I want you to try and beat me![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hee hee! Hi there, Bede! Go easy on us, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Your poison could be trouble. I think I’ll knock you out of the match first![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oooh, it’s Marnie! I guess I should show you respect—you’ve been a Gym Leader longer.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Social status don’t mean a thing in battle! I’m goin’ all out![VAR 0114(000D)]
Ugh, such tacky makeup and outrageous clothing. I see victory in fashion is already mine.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Heeey, are you talkin’ about me? I’ll snap that ridiculous hair of yours in two...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Oh, hi there, Peo-kins! I don’t need to hold back at all if we’re up against you![VAR 0114(0073)]
Gaaah! Enough with that nickname already! Don’t lose your dentures, old man![VAR 0114(0076)]
Woo-hoo! It’s Leon! Make sure you go all out, my boy![VAR 0114(0073)]
As if there’s any other way I battle! Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s super Champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
A legendary Fighting Gym Leader and former Champion... It is an honor to face you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, no need to be so formal! It never hurts to have a more lighthearted battle now and then![VAR 0114(0073)]
Well, you’re caught up in a face-off between two seniors now, Champion. Too bad for you, I guess.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come now, Opal! We’re still young and full of fight! Time for a refreshing battle to prove it![VAR 0114(0073)]
Remember, Leon—I’m done with the League! Take it easy on us![VAR 0114(0076)]
You’re forgetting I’m retired, too! Besides, I don’t think I can go easy on you and win![VAR 0114(0004)]
Brace yourself, Peony! Our flames are about to melt through your steel![VAR 0114(0010)]
Burnin’ fierce as ever, aren’t you, Kabu? Let’s go, Chief! I’m countin’ on your backup![VAR 0114(0076)]
A two-on-two match isn’t what I’d prefer... Still, the tournament ends for you right here, Leon![VAR 0114(0017)]
It doesn’t matter what kind of match it is, Raihan. I won’t lose! Come on—give me all you’ve got![VAR 0114(0004)]
Fancy meeting you on a big stage like this, Hop! This should be a fun match![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m not gonna lose, Lee! ’Sides, I need to show [VAR 0100(0000)] just how good I’ve got![VAR 0114(0005)]
I should hope you’re at least a little bit stronger now, Mr. Wannabe Professor Hop.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Gah, do you ever quit it with the attitude?! Guess I’ll show you everything I’ve learned![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll show them the results of your training, old la—I mean, Ms. Opal![VAR 0114(000C)]
Almost called me an old lady again, didn’t you? Maybe I need to adjust that attitude a bit more.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t you dare go easy just ’cause we’re family, Big Bro![VAR 0114(000D)]
I wasn’t plannin’ on it... But it ain’t easy to resist the urge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Just my luck I’d get pitted against a Grass-type user like you, Milo... But I don’t plan on losing![VAR 0114(000F)]
That’s what I thought! You’ve never been one to let type matchups get in the way, Nessa![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll need to watch out for you, Kabu. Don’t want you burning all my efforts down![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can’t fool me, Milo! I know your plants aren’t that easy to deal with![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hope you don’t mind me Dynamaxing my Pokémon, Piers![VAR 0114(000E)]
It’s not like size is the only thing that counts. Give ’em everything you’ve got![VAR 0114(0016)]
I guess now’s my chance to get even for my defeat in the Finals, Raihan![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can try, anyway! But I hope you’re ready for some rough weather![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m sure the type disadvantage won’t slow you down... Right, Kabu?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I would certainly like to live up to your high expectations, Nessa. Let me turn up the heat![VAR 0114(0010)]
Whichever side wins...[VAR 0114(000F)]
...No hard feelings![VAR 0114(0011)]
A battle with you, Nessa? I’d better brace for a long haul...[VAR 0114(0015)]
All the more room for us to put on a show for the crowd![VAR 0114(000F)]
I have a trick up my sleeve for taking on dragons. Don’t get caught off guard, Raihan![VAR 0114(0010)]
Right back at you, Kabu! Whatever trick you have, we’re gonna run right over it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on, Piers! Let’s see if you can shut me down with your Dark-type moves![VAR 0114(0017)]
Careful what you wish for! I don’t do encores, but requests are another story![VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, well, well! If it isn’t my spiky-haired friend! A fine stepping-stone on my path to glory![VAR 0114(0068)]
Might want to dial down the arrogance. Pride goes before the fall...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Startin’ to look like a rock star, aren’t you? Show me how much you’ve grown![VAR 0114(0016)]
Course, mate! I’m always growing! Hope you’re ready to be blown away, Piers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think it’s about time that I inherit the title of the strongest Gym Leader in Galar.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Your Pokémon and your will may be hard as rock, but my dragons will smash right through![VAR 0114(0017)]
I think it’s best if I focus on your dragon Pokémon, Raihan.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If this were a one-on-one battle, I’d be in for a rough time... But with my partner, we’ll push back the cold![VAR 0114(0017)]
Fighting types can be trouble... But I won’t let you shatter us so easily![VAR 0114(0014)]
Then I will simply strike you until you do shatter! I hope you’re ready for this, Gordie![VAR 0114(0011)]
I-I’ll do my best, Milo...[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s the spirit, Allister! I’ll be rooting for you, even though we’re on opposite teams![VAR 0114(000E)]
Hello there, Allister! Guess we’re on opposite teams this time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
P-please don’t be too harsh on us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Your mask is beautiful, no matter how many times I see it! Are you sure you cannot let me have it?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Uh... N-no, I can’t...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Prepare to witness our celebrity powers, beautiful madam of ice![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, aren’t we silver-tongued! But don’t think you can sweet-talk me into going easy on you![VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, well, well! If it isn’t my dearest brother! What a happy coincidence to meet you here![VAR 0114(0068)]
It is nothing short of a miracle, Brother! This is cause for celebration![VAR 0114(0069)]
Hey there, Milo! I hope you’re ready, ’cause I’ve grown stronger since the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess I’d better be ready to be surprised! It’s part of the fun of being the first Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m still going to win, even without boosts from getting quiz answers correct![VAR 0114(0005)]
You answered all my questions correctly, child... And I see you’ve got the correct attitude, too![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re aimin’ to be the best Pokémon Professor ever, right? Better brush up on battles, then![VAR 0114(000D)]
You got that right! I’ll become a professor that’ll be able to go toe-to-toe with Gym Leaders![VAR 0114(0005)]
Why hello there, Hoppy-kins! How’s studying to become a professor coming along?[VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m taking a break for now! And I’m not about to let even my big bro’s master end my break![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oho! I see some familiar faces! Now this reminds me of the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph. Can’t say that I have too many pleasant memories of that...[VAR 0114(000C)]
C’mon! Let’s see who’s got the strongest![VAR 0114(000D)]
Not too long ago, we were seeing you off at the station, and now you’re the Champion, eh?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yeah, I remember sending you off with a good round of cheering at Motostoke![VAR 0114(0010)]
Time flows like a swift river, doesn’t it? I’d rather not think too much about it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Well now, it’s us three good friends and the Champion, all here together![VAR 0114(0010)]
It’s interesting when you think about it. The three of us are weak against each other’s types![VAR 0114(000E)]
Not to mention we already know each other’s strategies. This is going to be tricky...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ve been training my legs on the hills of Turffield! Leave it to me to really dig my heels in![VAR 0114(000E)]
Hey now! I brave the rough waves of Hulbury every day, you know! I’m no pushover![VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, um, well... We have that lift in Motostoke?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Well! [VAR 0100(0000)], my liege! And your spiky-haired follower, I see.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Guess there’s no point hopin’ the pair of you’ll ever lose yer rude streak, huh?[VAR 0114(0016)]
True celebrities change not their attitude, even if they have a change of heart![VAR 0114(0069)]
You’ve developed a nice depth to your battle technique, boy.[VAR 0114(0013)]
No need to flatter me, Opal. Compared to you two, I’m just a whippersnapper![VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh, come off it! You’ve got the air of a seasoned veteran! Way more than me, actually![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’re taking on Leon? Great. Now my partner’ll never shut up...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Raihan always goes all out against me, but you’d better give your best too, Piers![VAR 0114(0004)]
Leon’s mine, Piers! Don’t get in my way![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] and Piers, huh? That’s a fun combination![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve got my hands full just keepin’ up with all of [VAR 0100(0000)]’s shenanigans, really.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Is that so? Well, you’d both better be ready, because I’ve got some shenanigans of my own![VAR 0114(0017)]
