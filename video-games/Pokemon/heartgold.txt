[VAR(517)]UNOWN Report
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]
[VAR(517)] Number of UNOWN
[VAR(517)]Current Kinds: [VAR(307, 0, 0)]
[VAR(517)][VAR(306, 0, 0)]/[VAR(306, 1, 0)]
Found a strange puzzle in the ruins. Solved it, and suddenly a hole opened up in the ground and I dropped into the room below! Should have known that ancient ruins would have surprising tricks like that.
There was a stone statue where I fell. The place might have been a reception hall. Then, suddenly, the UNOWN appeared. That puzzle was like a key somehow. It woke the UNOWN up from their sleep. These ruins have become difficult.
If you turn on the radio in the ruins, you can receive mysterious radio waves! It’s proof that the UNOWN communicate with each other using radio waves!
There are as many UNOWN as there are letters in the alphabet. Right now, we’re confirming the existence of 26 kinds of UNOWN. Do you think you can find all 26 of them?
It seems that individually they don’t make much sense, but when the various UNOWN are arranged in order, they begin to make sense. In nature, they seem to be scattered around randomly, but the truth is they’re arranged in a very specific order.
In this report, the scattered UNOWN were sorted and put into order by the research-center staff. That makes the UNOWN much easier to understand.
Scratched on the floor of the ruins are UNOWN letters. Finding the room feels like a huge discovery! The Researchers were very excited and said they were going to go check it out.
There aren’t just 26 different kinds of UNOWN. Two more have been discovered! But that begs the question of where those other two kinds are hiding...
[VAR(516, 24)]The characters found scratched on the floor in the small room are transcribed here in this report.
[VAR(516, 72)]OUR FRIENDS LOOK UP AND HEARTILY CONGRATULATE US
[VAR(516, 120)]We don’t know what this could possibly mean yet.
The Researchers were saying that they’ll need to examine the ruins again, but...?
In the past, it seems that UNOWN lived with relatives of humans in these ruins. In the lower levels of these ruins is a Pokémon statue. We’ve come to understand that it was those relatives who made that statue.
The UNOWN are very timid creatures, so they don’t go outside the ruins. Even if a bunch of people gathered near the ruins, it is said that the ones who wished for UNOWN and humans to again coexist have all left.

Good, good! We’ve got a nice picture! You can see all the pictures on your PC.
Wait a second! My superhuman ability is telling me that your Photo Album is full! Sorry to trouble you, but can you delete some pictures before you talk to me again?
Hmmm... You don’t seem to have a Photo Album. For you to sort pictures taken, you will need one. My big brother runs a memorial photo studio at Goldenrod City. Why don’t you go there to get one?
Aren’t you a shy one?

Welcome to the Battle Castle. My name is Darach. I will be your host on behalf of Lady Caitlin, the owner of the castle. First, I must ask you for any items your Pokémon are holding. They will be returned to you when you leave. Next, I have here 10 Castle Points, CP, that can be used only here. They are for you. Please accept them.

Darach: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], congratulations! You are to be commended on your mastery for keeping the streak alive. Our owner, appreciating your worth, demands you battle the Castle Valet. You are prepared, yes? 
Darach: Welcome. I am Darach, as you know, and I am the Castle Valet. Lady Caitlin, my employer, is not one to accept defeat willingly. However, for a reason I’m not at liberty to disclose, she cannot battle. Consequently, I will do battle in her ladyship’s place. ...Let me assure you that you won’t be shortchanged by facing me. En garde! 
Darach: Your mastery of Pokémon is as breathtaking as ever. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you certainly are to be commended. ...However, if I may say so, I noticed something about the way you battle. After all, I have had the opportunity to watch you closely firsthand. So, what is it that I noticed? As a Trainer myself, it is but proper etiquette to show you in a battle. Let us begin! En garde! 
Darach: [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you are truly in possession of a superlative talent! I drew on every reserve of experience and etiquette handed down through our heritage of glorious servitude. But even then, I failed to fend off your inspired and inspiring challenge. I shall see to appeasing Lady Caitlin’s displeasure at my loss. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], please do return to our Battle Castle. We will be delighted and feel privileged to have you back! 
Darach: I am humbled... What I’d perceived to be a weakness was only illusory... Or, perhaps you corrected it in the course of our battle. Regardless, your performance was stunning again. Though she cannot say it, Lady Caitlin appears quite taken by your style. For her sake at the very least, please do return to our Battle Castle!

VOLTORB Flip is a game in which you flip over cards to find numbers hidden beneath them. The cards are hiding the numbers 1 through 3...and VOLTORB as well. The first number you flip over will give you that many Coins. From then on, the next number you find will multiply the total amount of Coins you’ve collected by that number. If it’s a 2, your total will be multiplied by “x2.” If it’s a 3, your total will be multiplied by “x3.” But if you flip over a VOLTORB, it’s game over. When that happens, you’ll lose all the Coins you’ve collected in the current game. If you select “Quit,” you’ll withdraw from the game. If you get to a difficult spot, you might want to end the game early. Once you’ve found all the hidden 2 and 3 cards, you’ve cleared the game. Once you’ve flipped over all these cards, then you’ll advance to the next level. As you move up in levels, you will be able to receive more Coins. Do your best! 
The numbers at the side of the board give you a clue about the numbers hidden on the backs of the panels. The larger the number, the more likely it is that there are many large numbers hidden in that row or column. In the same way, you can tell how many VOLTORB are hidden in the row or column. Consider the hidden number totals and the VOLTORB totals carefully as you flip over panels. 
Select “Open Memo” to mark the cards. You can mark the cards with the numbers 1 through 3, but also with a VOLTORB mark. When you have an idea of the numbers hidden on the back of the cards, touch “Open Memo” and select the cards to mark. If you want to remove a mark, touch the mark again, and it will disappear. 
Will this be the last card?!
Is this what you’re expecting?!

Mom: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Welcome home. It sounds like you had quite the experience out there. Maybe you should take a quick rest so you can relax. ... ...
Mom: Oh, good! You and your Pokémon are looking great. Oh, yes, I heard from Professor Elm. He said that a Pokémon’s energy is measured in HP (Hit Points). If your Pokémon lose their HP, you can restore it at any Pokémon Center. If you’re going to travel far away, the smart Trainer stocks up on Potions at the Pokémon Mart. Make me proud, honey! Take care!
Mom: Oh, good! You and your Pokémon are looking great. Oh yes, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your Pokémon will faint if it runs out of HP. If your Pokémon loses its HP, come home before it faints. It will be healed to full health by taking a rest. Well, honey, make me proud! Take care!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Your Pokémon have been healed to perfect health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center when your Pokémon’s HP goes down. If you’re planning to travel any distance, you should stock up on Potions at a Pokémon Mart. Good luck, Trainer!

Hello! Here I’ll explain to you about the Trainer Card. Your Trainer Card, with your Pokémon of course, is proof of your status as a Pokémon Trainer while you’re out adventuring. It keeps automatic records of all kinds of information. If you touch the card, you can view the reverse side. You can sign the back of your card. You can show off your signature to anyone you meet in the Union Room! But your signature will be erased if you decide to sign your card again, so be careful!

Blaine: My Fire-type Pokémon will be even stronger! Just you watch!
Wow, to see a Gym in a cave like this? I’d love to explore it.

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: ... ...Humph! He calls himself the Elder, but he was no match for me. Sure enough, those who lecture how you should be “nice” to Pokémon... They cannot defeat me. All I care about are strong Pokémon that win every time. The rest of them don’t mean anything to me. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] used an Escape Rope!
So good of you to come here! Sprout Tower is a place of training. People and Pokémon test their bonds to build a bright future together. I am the final test. Allow me to check the ties between you and your Pokémon! 
Hmmm... The way you battle is quite elegant. You should be able to stand up to Falkner. And you should be able to make good use of this... It is a Technical Machine called Flash. Take it with you! 
When a Pokémon learns Flash, you can illuminate caves no matter how dark they may be. You can try it on BELLSPROUT, for example...
I hope you learn and grow from your journey.
It’s a powerful painting of a BELLSPROUT.

So many people have gone up the tower with a Rainbow Wing to try and bring back HO-OH. But none succeeded in making HO-OH appear... The Rainbow Wing is merely to permit you to go up this tower. What HO-OH has longed for is the invisible trust between people and Pokémon... Or the person who can restore such a relationship... 
A long time ago, there used to be a Pokémon at the top of this tower, namely HO-OH. But it flew away, and no one has seen it since... If anyone who could restore deep trust between people and Pokémon were to come here with something linked to HO-OH... It may come down for such a person... 
That thing you have...! 
You have done it... Please come through.
That Rainbow Wing will merely permit you to go up the tower. If you are not the kind of person who would restore the trust between people and Pokémon, HO-OH will never show itself to you...
Hmmm. So it was you and the Bell!
You are quite a remarkable Trainer for your age...

This is all we can do for you... What you do now is entirely up to you...
That IS indeed HO-OH... The guardian of the sky around here from ancient times... So many have tried and tried, only to fail... [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your heart and the Clear Bell in harmony have finally made it appear... 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], don’t you see? HO-OH must have been waiting for someone like you all this time. Wouldn’t you agree...? 
HO-OH: Shaoooh! 
You have done a great job. Say hello to Professor Elm for us.
You have not only made HO-OH appear, but you have also caught it... You are so wonderful. There is nothing more for us to say. Take good care of yourself in your journey...
If that is what you believe, we will not try to convince you otherwise. Still, if you want to see HO-OH once more, perhaps you can come back here after everything has been settled...

Eusine: My name is Eusine. I’m on the trail of a Pokémon named SUICUNE. And you are...? [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? Glad to meet you. I heard rumors that SUICUNE is here, so I came to look. Take a look at the basement through the hole in the floor. There. SUICUNE is down there. I could go downstairs, but I know it would run away in no time. I know. I have tried it many times...
Eusine: There seems to be more than meets the eye with you...
Morty: My name is Morty. I am Ecruteak’s Gym Leader. Because my old friend Eusine is here on the trail of SUICUNE, I decided to investigate the Burned Tower. Ecruteak has a legend about these legendary Pokémon: SUICUNE, ENTEI, and RAIKOU. As the Gym Leader of Ecruteak, I must have a proper understanding of it.

Only one Pokémon can Stroll with you in a Pokéwalker... I can’t decide which one!
I may not look like it, but I have many Pokéwalkers on me! They make loud noises as I walk. Maybe taking a Stroll isn’t as easy as I thought...
Pay attention, please! ...Oops, I have to quit thinking like a teacher all the time. You must be a Pokémon Trainer. Since you’re working so hard, I want you to have this. 
                     
Let a Pokémon hold that Quick Claw. Sometimes it will strike first during battle.
It’s fun having a Pokémon out of its Poké Ball to walk with it, but the Pokéwalker is a whole new dimension.
My mom can’t take my Pokémon and tells me not to play with it indoors. But, hey! I can keep it in my Pokéwalker. That way, I’m always with it!
I take walks in the park, but I never go into the grass. Trainers always want to battle...

Lullabies on the radio make wild Pokémon sleepy. That’s why you don’t see many Pokémon when the radio plays lullabies in the tall grass.
Why would they want to take over the Radio Tower?

Ouch! 
Are you OK? I was in a hurry and... Sorry, did I hurt you? 
No way! Could it be a Pokémon from Sinnoh... The one they call ARCEUS...? 
Oh, could it be...? ARCEUS causing all this...? I cannot explain it any other way... 
ARCEUS may be the key to solving the mystery of the UNOWN and the Ruins of Alph...? 
Can you come to the Ruins of Alph with me? Please! You must! I am trembling with excitement. I think something is about to happen!

Bravo! A promising youth who is about to start the journey of archaeology has just arrived! 
What? Just a visitor? Oh, I see... You got me excited for nothing.
My staff here at the Ruins Research Center is excellent, and the research makes good progress with absolutely no effort on my part. If you have any questions, feel free to talk to my staff!
I managed to unravel quite a lot of the mystery of UNOWN with your help! Thank you, thank you. Thank you, again!
The ruins are about 1,500 years old. That’s all we know about them. But it’s not known why they were built...or by whom.
Wow, did you catch an UNOWN? That’s wonderful! Come to think of it... How come we’ve suddenly started to see UNOWN?
You have to hear this! This is a big discovery! It was you who solved the stone-panel puzzle that allowed UNOWN to appear. Those tablets are the key to waking up UNOWN! Still... Why would anyone make such a key? 
You have to hear this! This is a big discovery! If you turn on the radio in the ruins, you can receive mysterious radio waves! It’s proof that UNOWN communicate with each other using radio waves! 
You have to hear this! This is a big discovery! There are as many UNOWN as there are letters in the alphabet! There have been 26 types confirmed. Why don’t you collect them all? 
How do you like the UNOWN Report I gave you? UNOWN are recorded as you catch them. It is quite useful!
You have to hear this! This is a big discovery! We have figured out that UNOWN are in a certain order! Let me see your report. 
There! I put the UNOWN in the correct order! We may be able to tell more about them. 
What? You found a room with UNOWN symbols? That is a big discovery! We will study them right away. 
You have to hear this! This is a big discovery! We have found two new UNOWN symbols! It means that... There must be two more kinds of UNOWN somewhere... 
You have to hear this! We are learning more and more about the symbols on the floor! ...It seems that UNOWN were living at the ruins with a human clan. It is thought that this clan made the Pokémon statues underground. The UNOWN were easily scared and wouldn’t go outside. When more and more people started to appear around the ruins, the clan that wished to live in harmony with the UNOWN eventually left... Thanks to our research and your help, we have unraveled so much about their mystery! We have so many things we don’t know left, of course. Archaeology never ends. 
I will let you know if I find out anything else.

There are odd patterns drawn on the walls of the ruins. They must be the keys for unraveling the mystery of the ruins.
The strange Pokémon you saw in the ruins? They appear to be very much like the drawings on the walls there. Hmm... That must mean there are many different kinds of them...

This is a big room, but there’s nothing here.
This place has a mystical quality to it. ...Or a historic quality... ...Or an eerie quality... ...Or an ancient quality... ...Or a solemn quality... ...Or a frosty quality... In essence, it feels sort of ethereal.

Oh, are you all right? You disappeared right in front of me. I was so surprised!

Would you like to take the Battle Room challenge? [VAR(512, 0)]
We hope to see you again!
The Battle Tower is a facility for Single or Double Battle challenges. Once entered, your challenge lasts until you lose. In Single Battle format, you enter with three Pokémon. In Double Battle format, you enter with four Pokémon. The battles are held in Battle Rooms, of which there are many in the tower. In each of the Battle Rooms, seven Trainers await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that!

Would you like to take the Multi Battle Room challenge? [VAR(512, 0)]
                          
The Battle Tower’s Multi Battle Rooms are for Multi Battles with a partner. To enter, join another Trainer and compete with two Pokémon each. Inside the tower is a room named the Battle Salon where you can meet other Trainers. There, you can find a Trainer to act as your partner in the Multi Battles. You can also partner up with a friend over wireless communications. Once you have partnered up, you will be shown to a Multi Battle Room. In the Multi Battle Room, seven tag teams await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven teams, you will earn Battle Points. If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Also, if you are on a tag team with a friend, you may not interrupt your challenge.

Welcome to the Battle Tower! I am your guide to the Wi-Fi Battle Rooms. 
Would you like to take the Wi-Fi Battle Room challenge? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Tower’s Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are places to conduct battles over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. As a result, you will be battling Trainers from around the world. Inside the Battle Tower, there are many Battle Rooms. In each of the Battle Rooms, seven Trainers await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven, you will earn Battle Points. Depending on how you do, you may even become the room’s leader! Also, the Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are operated on a ranking system. Trainers will go up in rank if they keep winning Wi-Fi Battles. Contrarily, their rankings could go down if they lose consistently. To raise your rank, keep winning, especially against tougher Trainers. If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. 
We hope to see you again!

Me? I just made a debut as an Idol! I haven’t gotten much work yet. So whenever I have time, I come here to battle Pokémon.
I trained my little guy till we couldn’t take any more. He’s going to do a 50-win streak for sure... Right, PIKACHU?
PIKACHU: ...
I’ve always loved this kind of see-through elevator since I was young. Or not! When I was young, this kind of elevator was unheard of!

You can call me the Judge. Heheh, it’s actually not my real name, but that’s what everyone calls me. It’s because of this weird power I have. It’s a gift, really. I can discern--judge you can say--the overall potential of individual Pokémon. If you’d like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon. 
If you’d like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon. 
...Oh. You don’t need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?! That’s a tall order even for me. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon’s potential is decent all around. That’s my determination, and it’s final. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon’s potential is above average overall. That’s my determination, and it’s final. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon has relatively superior potential overall. That’s my determination, and it’s final. 
I see, I see... This Pokémon has outstanding potential overall. That’s my determination, and it’s final. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its HP. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Attack stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Defense stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Atk stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Def stat. 
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Speed stat. 
It’s rather decent in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
It’s very good in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
It’s fantastic in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
It can’t be better in that regard. That’s how I judged it.
A Ribbon will be awarded to the participating Pokémon!

Palmer: So, you’ve come this far! As the Tower Tycoon, I’ll have to give you my best effort. That’s how the best Trainers show respect to each other. By battling all out as dedicated students of Pokémon! 
Bravo! I imagine many great Trainers will come to challenge me as you have just done. That’s something I look forward to a great deal. You will become even more skilled. Keep battling Trainers from around the world and keep growing greater in stature! 
Bravo! I feel inspired in my heart! My young friend, the world and your future hold infinite promise. The spirits of people and Pokémon call for each other in resonance. The resulting bond is infinitely strong! Go on, you can be all that you desire! There is no limit to where you can go!

Battle Tower... It’s so tall! I wonder how many times my height it is?
All the places in the Battle Frontier let you team up with a friend! That’s so cool, don’t you think? I wish I had a friend to team up with...
I am the super Idol in Johto! I’ve come all the way to the Battle Frontier to promote my latest song! But... Everybody seems to be a Poké Maniac here!
Fishing won’t keep me calm since I came to know about the Battle Frontier. When I go fishing, I find myself quitting early and coming here.
The place I like best among the five facilities here would be the Battle Castle, because you can see Lady Caitlin there!
What makes me the most happy being a Trainer? The fact that Pokémon will always bring me lots of friends!
Just like people go through different things they can learn from, Pokémon learn different things from battles. Behind every experience, there is a story. Isn’t that right, dear?
All experiences lead to a tale. I’m not wrong, am I, dear?
I’ve come to the Battle Frontier to get a job! Thanks to my previous job, I’m good at cooking, cleaning, and laundry!
To be strong is to be weak. To be weak is to be strong. Somebody told me that before. I don’t quite understand it yet, but it sounds deep. I’ll just give myself some time to figure it out.
Watching these people who care so much about Pokémon makes me feel ashamed of my selfishness. I’ll try and face my Pokémon for real!
I wonder how many years it’s been since I first met a Pokémon? ...Forty-nine! Oh, I lost the page that kept track of how many years, days, and hours... Could it be my Pokémon nibbling on it?
Trainers care about Pokémon as the battle progresses. In return, Pokémon repay that trust by using moves the best they can. What you see in a battle is the trust between people and Pokémon. This may seem obvious, but it’s actually incredibly amazing!
You cannot try anything if you are afraid of losing battles. But! Getting into a battle knowing you have no chance of winning will only make your Pokémon suffer. That’s not courage! Truly good Trainers know the balance between courage and cautiousness.
If you want to graduate from being a so-so Trainer, mark my words! The Pokémon’s type! The moves to be learned! The items to be held! You can’t overlook a single detail.
When people win a battle, some laugh at their opponent. Some brag about his or her strengths. Some even start to dance around  claiming he or she is number one in the world. I respect people who win and then care about their opponent.
Have you heard of the Brains of the Battle Frontier? There are five facilities in the Battle Frontier. At every one, you can win your way through to challenge the bosses called the Frontier Brains. They’re out-of-this-world tough!
Allowing us to enjoy battles, helping us work, taking us to places far away, or just being good friends... Pokémon are so deep. I wanna be like Pokémon.
At the Battle Factory, you have to keep winning with rental Pokémon. I may not stand a chance at other facilities, but I may go all the way here!
The Battle Hall is where Pokémon battle one-on-one for as long as they can. Even my MAGIKARP has a shot at number one! Wow! Just the thought of it makes me excited!
Life is full of ebbs and flows. I’ll keep my inflatable tube close. I could call it the wisdom I gained in the last five years of my life.

Some Trainers rely on a Pokémon’s potential alone. But you can use items and medicines to help improve a Pokémon’s capabilities.
Mountain climbing and Pokémon are similar in a sense. They both come down to potential! I do not rely on items or medicines but rather potential and training for battle!

Some people are surprised to see a small girl like me at the Battle Frontier all by herself. It’s not like I have to battle myself, you know? 
My lifelong hobby has been battling using Pokémon. A battle after breakfast, a battle after lunch, and after dinner... I just take a bath and go to bed.

Welcome to the Battle Frontier! This is your first visit? Right this way, please! 
Oh! You have a Vs. Recorder! How nice! We upgrade Vs. Recorders for first-time visitors for Battle Frontier use. I’ll borrow yours for a moment. Let’s see... Slide open this part here, and ticka-tacka-kachunk there! All done! Here you go. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s Vs. Recorder was upgraded.
Our other staff will be pleased to explain how the individual facilities of the Battle Frontier operate. I can go over general topics. Do you have any questions? [VAR(512, 0)]
Which topic should I explain? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Frontier has five facilities dedicated to battling. At the Battle Tower, the objective is to beat seven Trainers in a row. At the Battle Hall, you may keep battle records of individual Pokémon. At the Battle Factory, you must win consecutive battles with rentals. The Battle Castle forces Trainers to manage Castle Points to advance. And finally, the Battle Arcade is where random luck triggers events. You can try any of these facilities! 
The battles at the five Battle Frontier facilities are held under special rules. First and foremost, no Exp. Points can be earned. Consequently, the Pokémon battling here will not level up. If the Level 50 rule is chosen, Pokémon of higher levels will be temporarily reduced to Lv. 50. Pokémon under Lv. 50 will be entered without an upward level adjustment. 
Battle Points are usually referred to as BP. BP are points that are used only in the Battle Frontier. BP are awarded for meeting certain performance goals at the various Battle Frontier facilities. BP can be exchanged for prizes at the Exchange Service Corner. 
The Exchange Service Corner is comprised of two tents straight ahead past here. There, you may exchange your BP for a wide variety of prizes. Please do visit it! 
The Performance Monitor shows Trainer data, such as the previous record and the best record to date. You will find one near the reception counter in each facility. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
           
         
            
          
   
           
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Tower works? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Tower is the building at the back of the Battle Frontier. The object here is to enter a team of different Pokémon and battle on until you lose. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Factory works? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Factory is at the upper- right corner of the Battle Frontier. There, you engage in a knockout tournament with rented Pokémon. The goal is to keep winning for as long as possible. Every time you win a match, you may trade one of your Pokémon for one of the opponent’s Pokémon. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Hall works? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Hall is at the upper-left corner of the Battle Frontier. Here, you enter one Pokémon of your choosing for one-on-one battles. The objective is to keep your winning streak going as long as possible. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Castle works? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Castle is at the lower-left corner of the Battle Frontier. Here, you are provided with Castle Points, CP, that you must manage. The CP are used for healing Pokémon, renting items or Berries, and so on. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive while managing your CP. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier! Should I explain how the Battle Arcade works? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Battle Arcade is at the lower-right corner of the Battle Frontier. Here, a game board is activated before every match. Depending on what comes up on the game board, an event takes place. Some events will be good to the challenger, while others won’t be. The challenger may even avoid having to battle at all. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive as long as possible. 
We hope you enjoy your visit!
The Battle Frontier is up ahead! I have explored places all over the world, but nothing compares to the excitement I feel right now! What kinds of Trainers will I see? What battles will I experience? It’s a whole new adventure for me!
The five facilities of the Battle Frontier are... Tower. Hall. Castle. Factory. And Arcade. How do you make an acronym out of that? THCFA? Rearrange those letters, maybe? FATCH! CHAFT! ...Nope! Nothing works! Didn’t anyone think of this?!
The Vs. Recorder is sure nifty! Checking the Frontier Record will tell you how much BP you have.
My dream is to battle Palmer of the Battle Tower. I want to record it for posterity on my Vs. Recorder. But I left my Vs. Recorder at home... I’m heartbroken!

Oh my! I fell asleep and ruined my chances of being the first to arrive here... Stupid, stupid me... Sob...sob...
Stupid, stupid me... Sob...sob...
Click, click, click... Oh! It is you! I’ve gotten over being first all the time. Now I’m counting the number of people coming to the Battle Frontier. Of course no one asked me to. It’s just a hobby.
I can’t stop shivering! I told my family that I would conquer the Battle Frontier when I left home... But now I’m here, and somehow I can’t stop shivering! What am I gonna do if I get beaten to a pulp? 
...You look quite young. ... ... I will pull myself together and challenge the Battle Frontier... Maybe! 
I will pull myself together and challenge the Battle Frontier! ... Or I might not! 
Finally! I’m here at the Battle Frontier! When a Pokémon battle on the road doesn’t satisfy you any longer, you have to come to the Battle Frontier! Wouldn’t you agree?
Normally, choosing which Pokémon is all there is to a Pokémon battle. But when you change certain rules or limitations, the battle suddenly becomes even more fun. And this place you can have such fun... is called the Battle Frontier!
This Is the Battle Frontier Come, Proud Trainers Aim for the Top!

The staff tell you about the next Trainer you’ll face. They’re very helpful here. Don’t you think? 
They tell you about the next Trainer you’ll face? That’s really nice. You know, you can prepare for it once you know what kind of Trainer the next one is!
It’ll help you choose a Pokémon when you remember what kind of Pokémon the other Trainer had and what moves they used.
This is a place to battle with rental Pokémon, right? It is a good chance to try Pokémon you’ve never trained. You’ll learn about new Pokémon while having exciting battles! What more could you want?
Do you have a lot of Pokémon? I’m not too proud to say this, but... I have only a few! But there is nothing to worry about. Do you know why? This facility, the Battle Factory, has you use rental Pokémon for battles!
So you have to battle with Pokémon you just met instead of with your cherished Pokémon you’ve always battled with? Oh, I don’t know if I could... Will they be nice to me...? I’m a little worried.
All the Trainers gathered at the Battle Frontier are nice, pleasant people! I’m patrolling here on duty, but otherwise I would love to change my uniform to participate!

Welcome to the Battle Hall! I am your guide to the Single and Double Battle challenges. Please be aware that these challenges are designed for a single Trainer. 
Which challenge would you like to take?[VAR(512, 0)]
At the Battle Hall, you may take Single or Double Battle challenges alone. For the Single Battle challenge, you enter one Pokémon of at least Lv. 30. The Double Battle Challenge requires you to enter two of the same kind of Pokémon that are at least Lv. 30 each. Winning-streak records are kept for individual kinds of Pokémon. That makes it possible for any kind of Pokémon to aim for no. 1. When you enter the Hall, you will be asked to choose the type and rank of the Pokémon you want to battle. If you manage to win ten matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Please be aware of that!

Want to raise strong Pokémon but have no clue which one to pick...? For those Trainers who feel this way, the Battle Factory is truly a place worth visiting!
You are quite right. They say life is an endless series of learning opportunities. This place is the best for learning about Pokémon battles and about other Trainers...
Aaaaand--bam! Aaaaaaaaaand--bam! I don’t have Pokémon yet, so I’m practicing throwing Poké Balls!
Grandma, yoo-hoo! Grandma! I’ve come to trade Accessories! I’ve got somethin’ just for my grandma!
Oh, thank you, my dear... You’re so cute and strong and nice... I’m lucky to have a grandchild like you.
That little girl over there with her grandma... I happen to know that little girl is incredibly strong... Looks can sometimes be deceiving.

The Battle Hall Multi Battle challenge requires both partners to enter the same kind of Pokémon. Please confer with your friend and choose the same kind of Pokémon. 
CHALLENGE
Do you eat your favorite dish first or leave it for later? At the Battle Hall, it’s better to start with the types that your Pokémon do not like. Why? Because the opposition goes up in level as you progress!
That opulent stage! Your streaks of winnings are kept per each kind of Pokémon. Every Pokémon can get up there. Don’t you think it’s wonderful you can aim for the top with any Pokémon?
Slow... My SLOWBRO is a cutie, but he’s even battled the Brain here. The Brain will take your Pokémon on at the same level, to be fair.
SLOWBRO: ...Slow?
Here is a tip! You should try the Battle Hall with not just your favorite Pokémon, but different kinds of Pokémon if you want to build your overall record as well.
At the Battle Hall, if it’s the same kind of Pokémon, you can enter different ones and still keep your record. You may want to have different ones knowing different types of moves.
You know how HOPPIP has two types-- Grass and Flying? That means it can appear as a Grass type and as a Flying type. Me? You could think of me as... a “Lighthearted” type and a “Beautiful” type, I guess.
A piece of advice... At the Battle Hall, the opposing Pokémon are matched in level to yours. That way, you can choose any of your Pokémon without worrying about their levels.
The Battle Hall lets you keep the winning-streak records. That’s neat, huh? ...Wait a sec! My friend and I can start challenges with identical conditions and see who can stretch their win streak the longest. That’s even more fun!
I keep track of the total number of wins from your longest Single Battle win streaks at the Battle Hall. To explain, I add only the longest win streaks of each kind of Pokémon.
When your total win-streak record hits certain figures, you will earn BP as a reward. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], your total win-streak record is presently [VAR(311, 1, 0)]. 
Your total win-streak record has reached [VAR(311, 2, 0)]. Here is your BP reward. 
When your total win-streak record reaches [VAR(311, 3, 0)], you will earn BP.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received [VAR(309, 4, 0)] BP!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], your total win-streak record stands at [VAR(311, 1, 0)]. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], your total win-streak record stands at [VAR(311, 1, 0)]. ...My goodness! That’s a fantastic record!
Winston: The Battle Hall’s been kind of boring lately. There haven’t been any dazzling challengers who can electrify crowds. The kind of challenger who can beat the Brain... Aren’t there any around?
Winston: Let me take a wild guess. Are you getting into the Battle Hall? It’s addictively fun, huh? The more you win, the more kinds of Pokémon you get to see, too.
Winston: ... ...Oh, sorry for staring! I saw you on stage the last time. You’ve got some star quality. I think I’m going to keep an eye on you. There’s real charisma there.
Winston: I check you out every time you get up on stage. You’re fun to watch, let me tell you. Now I’m always looking forward to seeing the combo of you and your Pokémon on stage.
Winston: Hey, there! What are you going to do this time? Which Pokémon are you going for a record with next? When I get to thinking about that, I get too wound up to sleep at night. That’s why I’ve been sleeping in lately!
Winston: Awesome! Seriously awesome! You’re beyond awesome, even! The love you show so many Pokémon... It’s no easy feat, I can tell ya!
Winston: I’ve never seen Pokémon battle as enjoyably as yours do. You’re the first of a kind for me as Trainers go. You know, I brag about you to everyone who’s willing to listen. I was saying that you’re going to be a star before you even got a record!
Winston: Go, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], go! Go, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], go! I’m thinking up some dance steps and cheers I can do to support you. If you want to see them, you’ll need to keep working on your records!
Winston: You’re phenomenal. All the battles you waged on stage... All those moments of glory... Your star burns so bright and huge! I can barely open my eyes around you!
Winston: The love for Pokémon you exhibited at the Battle Hall is as infinitely deep as it is wide... You can count on me, Winston, to be your lifelong fan. Just as you love Pokémon, I love you as the Pokémon superstar!
Serena: It’s about the Battle Hall... It hasn’t excited me lately. There’s been no gorgeous sort of challenger who can dazzle me. The kind of challenger who can make me a fan... Aren’t there any around?
Serena: Um... Excuse me? If you don’t mind me asking, are you getting into the Battle Hall? It’s fun in an engrossing way, isn’t it? Did you know? The more you win, the more kinds of Pokémon appear.
Serena: Um... Excuse me? I watched you when you were on stage. It made me feel all tingly seeing you. Um... You won’t mind if I cheer for you from now on, will you? Please, may I?
Serena: Um... Excuse me? I cheer for you the best I can. I can’t get up on stage with you, but I want to lend my support to your Pokémon and you for trying so hard.
Serena: Um... Excuse me? Can you tell me what kind of Pokémon you’re going for a record with next? When I start thinking about that, I get sort of all choked up. I have trouble sleeping at night when I get that way.
Serena: Um... Excuse me? Fantastic! It’s fantastic! You’re fabulously fantastic! The love you show so many Pokémon... It must take extraordinary effort.
Serena: I’ve never seen Pokémon battle as enjoyably as yours do. You’re the first Trainer ever who’s done that. I... I brag about you to all my friends. I hope you don’t mind. I tell them I wish I could be as wonderful a Trainer as you!
Serena: Hurray, hurray, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Go, Pokémon, go! ...Oh! Um... Excuse me. I was working on cheers and a dance routine for you. B-but, I’m sorry for being so silly and giddy and...
Serena: You’re so inspiring to me. All the glory you earned while battling so often on that shining stage... Just seeing you makes me feel all happy inside. ♫
Serena: Your Pokémon love that you’ve shown at the Battle Hall is as infinitely deep as it is wide... It’s amazing, but you love every kind of Pokémon there is. I love you for being so amazing and dedicated!
Lyra: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I love watching you battle here. Cause... you have fun whether you win or lose!
Ethan: The Battle Hall is great for Pokémon fans like me! I get to see so many new kinds of Pokémon I’ve never seen. It’s so cool!
Mom: [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I couldn’t help checking up on you! Everyone is working hard, but I have to say you look more delighted than anyone else! Oh, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], that’s right! I should go to the Department Store in Goldenrod and buy some useful items for you on the way home!
Professor Oak: You keep amazing me over and over again. What a Trainer you turned out to be! It’s not enough that you caught Pokémon in numbers beyond belief. That alone is fantastic enough. But you’ve bonded and battled with them as well. I am so proud to know you!
Whitney: I love showy events like the Battle Hall. I’m not saying that I want to stand out in the crowd... I just love seeing cute Pokémon getting lots of attention!

Welcome to the Battle Castle! I am your guide to the Multi Battle challenge. Please be aware that this challenge requires two Trainers. 
Would you like to take the Battle Castle Multi Battle challenge? [VAR(512, 0)]
You may team up with a friend for a Multi Battle challenge. Both Trainers are provided with Castle Points (CP) that must be managed. The CP is used for healing Pokémon, renting items or Berries, and so on. Trainers can use their CP on not only their own Pokémon, but also their partner’s. Both Trainers earn CP by winning matches. The objective is to keep a winning streak alive while managing your CP. If you manage to win seven matches in a row, you will earn Battle Points (BP). Please note: a Battle Castle Multi Battle challenge can’t be interrupted. 
We hope to see you again!

Listen carefully! If your Pokémon win without taking damage, you earn more CP. The more, the merrier! Look at me. I don’t have much...
Listen! You can earn more Castle Points or CP by facing higher-level opponents. This is what they call high risk, high return!
Before every battle, you should check the opponent’s lineup. Don’t be cheap with your CP. It’s like that old saying goes about knowing your enemy. “Unless you enter the enemy’s lair, you cannot take their prize.” ... That’s not the right old saying!
Mr. Darach... His feelings for Lady Caitlin are all bottled up... Oh, how I pine for him...
At first, you can only use CP for restoring HP. But you can spend CP to rank up. Then, you can even restore PP!
If you lose, your entire stock of CP is cleaned out to zero! This is the rule at the Battle Castle.
My dream is to wear a beautiful dress and live in a castle! That’s not what I meant to say... My dream is to live in a castle with someone who wears a beautiful dress!

The game board is like your life. It goes round and round as your fortune goes up and down... How did that sound? It almost made some kind of sense, didn’t it?
There’s an aspect of luck in Pokémon battles... The Battle Arcade reminds me of that, decisively. Very decisively...
What quality is most needed here? Is it strength? Wisdom? Luck? No. The answer is...flexibility. That’s what my gut tells me.
Do you know what I mean by “stop on the spot”? It’s the skill of stopping the game board at the right time! But, remember... If you don’t stop it in 30 seconds, it will stop by itself.
I thought I was fully prepared with my prized Pokémon, but I had to swap them and use my opponent’s instead! I need to rethink all my strategies.
I chose Pokémon that are good at attacking. But my opponent went for speed! Next time, I’ll try Pokémon with superior speed.
There are advantages to be gained from “stop on the spot” skills! But there’s a lot of fun in letting the unknown hand of luck decide...
The game board shows better choices the greater the wins you achieve... Could this board be alive...?
Did you figure this one out? Paralyzing events here won’t affect Ground-type Pokémon. You should tell everybody!
I’ll tell you something. Poisoning or freezing events can be made ineffective. ...If the Pokémon’s type or ability protects it from such status problems. Might be worth knowing!

A long time ago, the Whirl Islands used to be one large island. There were two countries fighting over the island back then. LUGIA, the guardian of the island, got upset and cast lightning bolts to tear the island into four pieces, then disappeared into the deep end of the waterfall basin... I will let you through if you bring the Silver Wing, which is said to have fallen from LUGIA. But the true challenge is whether LUGIA will appear in front of you. What LUGIA has longed for is the invisible trust between people and Pokémon... Or the person who can restore such a relationship...
LUGIA, the Pokémon of the island, hid itself deep in the end of the waterfall basin, and no one has seen it since... If anyone who could restore deep trust between people and Pokémon were to come here with something linked to LUGIA, it may show itself for such a person...
That thing you have...! 
You have found it... Please go ahead. 
You have found it... Please go ahead.
Silver Wing will merely permit you to go down the waterfall. If you are not the kind of person who would restore the trust between people and Pokémon, LUGIA will never show itself to you...

You have not only made LUGIA appear, but you also caught it... You are so wonderful. There is nothing more for us to say. Take good care of yourself in your journey...
If that is what you believe, we will not try to convince you otherwise. Still, if you wish to see LUGIA once more, perhaps you can come back here after all has been settled...

[VAR(259, 1, 0)]: You! Where have you been all this time? Prepare to lose to me this time. I challenge you! 
Lance: Calm down. I was in a bit of a hurry then. Sorry for that. But...I always welcome challengers! Hey! How about a Double Battle? 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)]: Humph! You can’t beat me one-on-one, can you? 
Lance: Come on. A Double Battle is really not bad. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you’ll be on my side! 
Lance: Come on. A Double Battle is really not bad. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you’ll be on my side!

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Come to my side! We’ll beat Lance together! 
Lance: Just as I expected. You two make quite a team... Going solo is certainly one way to aim for the top... But that’s not all there is to Pokémon battle. Although I don’t feel it’s necessary to remind you guys. See you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], another time!

Hm... Good to see you here. No need to explain why you came. Clair sent you here, didn’t she? That girl is a handful... I am sorry, but I must test you. Not to worry, you are to answer only a few questions. Ready? 
What are Pokémon to you? [VAR(512, 0)]
What helps you to win battles? [VAR(512, 0)]
What kind of Trainer do you wish to battle? [VAR(512, 0)]
What is most important for raising Pokémon? [VAR(512, 0)]
Strong Pokémon. Weak Pokémon. Which is more important? [VAR(512, 0)]
Hm... I see... You care deeply for Pokémon. Very commendable. That conviction is what is important! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], don’t lose that belief. It will see you through at the Pokémon League. 
Hah? I didn’t quite catch that... 
What was it you said?
Oh, I understand... 
So how did it go? I guess there’s no point in asking. You did fail? ... ...What? You passed? 
[VAR(65281, 200)]That can’t be![VAR(65281, 100)] 
You’re lying! Even I haven’t been approved! 
Clair! This child is impeccable, in skill and spirit! Admit defeat and confer the Rising Badge! ...Or must I inform Lance of this? 
I... I understand... 
Here, this is the Rising Badge... Hurry up! Take it! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Rising Badge from Clair!
The Rising Badge will enable your Pokémon to use the move for climbing waterfalls. Also, all Pokémon will know you as a Trainer and obey your every command without question. 
Clair... Reflect upon what it is that you lack and this child has. 
... ... 
By the way... Have you heard of LUGIA? It is a Pokémon said to have lived around Whirl Islands once... ...Never mind. Just mad words of the old. 
By the way... Have you heard of LUGIA? Er... Between Olivine and Cianwood are islands called Whirl Islands. There is a huge waterfall deep in the cave there. It is said that LUGIA rests in the deep end of the waterfall basin... You need a Silver Wing to reach the waterfall basin, I’ve heard...

Come again, if you so desire.
It’s been quite some time since a Trainer has gained our Master’s rare approval. In fact, not since Master Lance.
You know young Master Lance? He looks so much like our Master did in his youth. It’s in their blood.
Hm... Good to see you here. Your arrival is most fortunate. I have something for you. Take this DRATINI as proof that I now know your worth. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received DRATINI from the Master!
Hm? Your party is full.
Dragon Pokémon are symbolic of our clan. You have shown that you can be entrusted with one.
Clair appears to have learned an invaluable lesson from you. I thank you as her grandfather.
A boy close to your age is in training here. He is much like Clair when she was younger. It is a little worrisome...
Give a nickname to the DRATINI you received? [VAR(512, 0)]

You have a certain look... It reminds me of the kid who stood in front of me three years ago... You have the same eyes... ... I’m on my way to Goldenrod City to answer the call and join my team. Are you going to get in my way?

... ...Hey! Where has Giovanni gone? I wonder if he is listening to our broadcast... ... 
Giovanni: Mark my words. Not being able to measure your own strength shows that you are still but a child.

Baoba: I will keep upgrading my safari. I will let you know using Pokégear if I make any changes. 
Safari Zone... It makes me feel like I am in a foreign country. It brings up a strange feeling.
.................. (I am not a talker.)
KANGASKHAN: ..................
This Safari Zone is great! I just kept going after Pokémon! That made my JIGGLYPUFF upset though.
JIGGLYPUFF: Puu pupuu.
Safari, safari, it is so much fun. Safari, safari, so interesting, huh! So many Pokémon are waiting for us! ...That’s a song I made up. I sing it when I am in the Safari Zone.
Airily goes the Safari Ball under the blue sky. Sprinkly goes your sweat to celebrate a friendship. I love the Safari Zone! ...I made a whole jingle out of it. You think anyone would be interested?
I’ve decided to carry Pokémon drinks. This will be new to me, but I will do my best... 
Oh, you want to buy something? Can you wait while I get it ready? Just a minute... .................. 
BUTTERFREE: Flu flu.
There are many Pokémon to choose from, but nothing beats the cuteness of SLOWPOKE. People often say that I look like one!
SLOWPOKE: ...Yawn?
I have always wanted to catch my first Pokémon at the Safari Zone.
You may be under the impression there is a sophisticated system to customizing the Safari Zone, right? The real truth is that...
Arrrgh... I am so exhausted... This job uses so much of your energy...
Safari Zone This is where everything is thrilling. Feel free to come by and experience the wild!

Hi! Is it your first time here at the Safari Zone? [VAR(512, 0)]
Welcome, Owner! Should I explain the Safari Zone? [VAR(512, 0)]
At the Safari Zone, you can enjoy a Safari Game where you are given [VAR(307, 1, 0)] Safari Balls to try to catch Pokémon. When you have run out of Safari Balls, the game is over. When you see a Pokémon, you can choose to throw Bait or Mud. If you throw Bait, Pokémon tend to stay but will become more difficult to catch. If you throw Mud, it will become easier to catch, but the Pokémon may flee. Have fun at the Safari Zone!
Have fun at the Safari Zone!
Warden Baoba has something important to share with you!
This is the Area Customizer. What would you like to know about? [VAR(512, 0)]
The Safari Zone has six Areas. Plains Area... Peak Area... and so on. The Area Customizer allows you to change the combination of these Areas. What would you like to know? [VAR(512, 0)]
Check out the machine, and you’ll see the Area Customizer screen. The lower window shows the current Safari Zone setting. Select an Area with the A Button to swap it with another. What would you like to know? [VAR(512, 0)]
When you select an Area, then select Swap, you will see 12 new Areas. Select one of them by highlighting it and pressing the A Button. What would you like to know? [VAR(512, 0)]
When you select an Area, then select Order, the Area type will not change, but the location can now be changed. What would you like to know? [VAR(512, 0)]
Different Areas have different Pokémon living in them, so when you change Areas, you will see different Pokémon. Please do try the different Areas! What would you like to know? [VAR(512, 0)]
I am sorry, but this can’t be used yet. Warden Baoba has a great plan for this machine...or so he says. But even we don’t know what it is. It’s a secret.
Please enjoy the Area Customizer!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] turned on the Area Customizer! 
It is still under development.
Hi, I have been waiting for you! What do you think? This is a brand-new Safari Zone. By the way... I just had an idea. Would you like to take the Owner Aptitude Test? [VAR(512, 0)]
Right on! Let me explain how the test works. It’s very easy. All you have to do is to catch one GEODUDE at the Safari and show it to me. They are in the grass closest to the entrance. It shouldn’t take long before you catch one. Good luck!
Wow, I never thought anyone would decline! You can become the Safari Zone Owner, don’t you see? Owner... It’s got a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? You should try the test! [VAR(512, 0)]
Oh, wonderful! You’ve caught a GEODUDE! You’ve passed the first test. .................. Huh? Didn’t I tell you that there are two tests? That’s right! Becoming an owner is not that easy. The second test is... Well, I am still preparing for it. I will let you know once it’s ready. You need to wait just a little. I will call you with the Pokégear.
Show me the GEODUDE once you’ve caught one. They are in the grass closest to the entrance. It shouldn’t take long. Good luck!
I’ve been waiting for you! The test is ready. This time can you catch a SANDSHREW and show it to me? Sounds easy, right? Not really! SANDSHREW will not appear with the current Safari Zone setting. And that’s where this comes in handy! 
This sophisticated, high-tech machine lets you customize Safari Zone Areas. I call it the Area Customizer! You want to know how it works, don’t you? It’s a...secret! Well, you shouldn’t have trouble operating it. Just talk to the staff next to me! 
I almost forgot! I was in the middle of explaining the second test, wasn’t I? You will not see SANDSHREW with the current Safari Zone Areas, so you have to use the Area Customizer to change them. SANDSHREW live in the desert! Good luck!
You did it! You caught a SANDSHREW! I knew you could do it. You’ve passed the test! You are now the Safari Zone Owner! 
I’ve always wanted to see young people playing at the safari! I thought I might get some new ideas. That should help you complete your Pokédex. That’s what I have been thinking. 
By the way, though you are now the Safari Zone Owner, would you kindly continue to pay admission? We have our reasons. Don’t be upset. I’ll keep thinking about how I can create new fun ways to help you complete your Pokédex. Go have fun at the Safari Zone!
I will let you know as soon as I come up with something new, using the Pokégear!
Show me the SANDSHREW once you’ve caught one. SANDSHREW live in the desert! Good luck!
Slow down. Once the next test is ready, I will call you using the Pokégear. Give me some time, OK?
Hi, I have been waiting for you! I had an epiphany! A new attraction! I’ve decided to call it... Object Arrangement! This is going to be fun! You can place objects on the field as you play at the Safari Zone! 
Not only that, but the types of Pokémon you see will change depending on the types of objects you place. Isn’t it amazing? I will call you using the Pokégear if something else comes up! 
I will explain Object Arrangement. Would you like to know anything? [VAR(512, 0)]
I will explain Object Arrangement. Feel free to ask me any questions. 
There are many objects you can place anywhere as you walk around the Safari Zone, except on stairs and grass where Pokémon appear! You also want to remember that you can place up to 30 objects in an Area. Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
It is easy to place objects. All you have to do is make sure that the spot in front of you is clear. If it’s empty, you can select an object. Some objects are large and may need a large space. Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
If you want to remove an object, just walk up to it and check it. The objects you have placed will glow in the dark. It should help you at night. Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
There are many different objects. Ones that look like grass, like trees, like boulders, like water, and other types of objects... Try placing different objects. The number of objects placed in an Area is shown in the Area Customizer on the top screen. There will be more objects to come, as I’ll keep adding more. Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
The types of Pokémon you see will change depending on the types of objects you place. The Safari Zone is also changed at that point. Try placing different types of objects. Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
Beware! Once you’ve swapped Areas, the objects you placed will all be removed. Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
I hope you enjoy it! Go, and have fun!

What do you think? This is the Pokéathlon Dome! 
Pokéathlon is a sports festival for Trainers and Pokémon! Inside the Dome are various challenges awaiting Trainers and Pokémon to test their friendship. Why don’t you try it? 
You’re amazing, bud! This is a pleasant surprise! To see a Pokéathlete with strong potential is such a pleasure! I’m glad I held the Pokéathlon here in Johto. ...My name is Magnus. We shall meet again, bud. Magnus: See you, young Pokéathlete!

Running and jumping and... There are so many events for Pokémon to choose from. Which one should I try?
ODDISH: Odd! Odd!
There is more to Pokémon than battling!
MEOWTH: Nyaah!

Have you heard of Aprijuice? Pokémon can increase their Performance with food and drink. Aprijuice is a drink developed from nutrition research to improve Performance. If you let your Pokémon drink it before a Pokéathlon event, it will show its true potential!
SLOWBRO: Whick!
Each Pokémon has its unique traits. A true Pokéathlete knows them and lets the true Performance of his or her Pokémon emerge!

You put away the Apriblender in the Apricorn Box. 
When you have the Apriblender, you can make Aprijuice to let your Pokémon show their true potential! It’s so easy to make! All you have to do is to put Apricorns in the Apriblender. Put in as many as you can! The more, the merrier! Then you walk! You can run if you want... 98...99...100 steps! Here! Then you open it, give it to your Pokémon, or drink it yourself. You can buy Aprijuice here. Why don’t you try and see how it works? Do you have any more questions? [VAR(512, 0)]
Aprijuice improves a Pokémon’s Performance! Pokémon have strengths and weaknesses. But there is no need to worry. Give it Aprijuice, and you can max out its Performance! You will need it! Do you have any more questions? [VAR(512, 0)]
Choose from the three Apriblenders. The labels tell you what kind of drink it is. Different drinks have different effects. You should use them to suit the event you want to participate in. That’s how to make a top Pokéathlete. But remember this! If your Pokémon’s Performance is maxed out, you cannot make it higher. You should check your Pokémon’s Performance before you give it Aprijuice. Do you have any more questions? [VAR(512, 0)]
Charge yourself with friendship! Get in the know about Aprijuice! Pick one from the shelf!
So discerning of you! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s [VAR(264, 1, 0)]! Only $[VAR(309, 2, 0)]! Quite a bargain! [VAR(512, 0)]

So they have ten events? ...Which Pokémon should I choose?
There are five Pokéathlon courses! They are divided into Speed, Power, Stamina, Jump, and Skill. You have to choose your Pokémon carefully according to the course.
Some Pokémon are good at Speed events. Some are not. You need to form a team whose members can help one another.
If you go on, you’ll see the Museum of Pokéathlete Records. I will someday be a Pokéathlete holding a record there!
The score you achieve in the Pokéathlon will become Athlete Points, and you can exchange them for prizes. You may be the last team to finish, but your score will still count!
“Hurdle Dash” Many Hurdles await your Pokémon! Be faster and more precise than everyone else! Jump over the Hurdles and aim for number one!
“Pennant Capture” Pennants are hidden on the beach. Fight over them and come back with as many Pennants as you can!
“Circle Push” The time has come to show off your Pokémon’s Power! Push them away and stay in the Circle!
“Block Smash” A mountain of Blocks awaits your Pokémon! Use its Power to smash them all!
“Disc Catch” Discs are thrown at you. Jump and catch them in the air! Don’t get cornered by others. Catch as many as you can!
“Lamp Jump” You never know how high you’re going to bounce! Use your Pokémon’s Jump and Skill to score!
“Relay Run” Keep running until you can’t run any more! Three Pokémon work together to achieve victory!
“Ring Drop” Pokémon tackle! Go beyond your Stamina limit and stay in the Ring!
“Snow Throw” On an incredibly cold playfield, millions of balls of Snow await! Aim and throw! Time it right to show your skill!
“Goal Roll” Put your heart into hitting the ball! Attack! Defend your Goal! Aim for the other Goals! Who gets the victory?
Work with your Pokémon. Believe in them, and help them believe in you! Believe in their potential. Let the friendship lead your team to victory! The Pokéathlon is always with you!
Charge your energy with friendship! Give Aprijuice to your Pokémon!
Whitney: Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Are you here for the Pokéathlon? Me, too! I have been so excited since its construction. It is close to Goldenrod City, you know? 
Huh? Were you going to participate in the Pokéathlon looking like that? You’re not prepared at all, are you? So... Are you a medium or a small? You look more like a medium... OK! I’ll get you a jersey that suits you! You want to look your best if you’re going to participate in the Pokéathlon, don’t you? Wait right there! 
This is just right for you! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received a jersey!
You look perfect. Now that you are ready, I will... Oh, no! Where are my Pokémon? I have to go back. See ya! 
The vending machine is for participants! You can even use your Athlete Points. [VAR(512, 0)]
Which drink would you like? [VAR(512, 0)]
Clang! A can of [VAR(264, 0, 0)] dropped down.

Welcome to the Museum Shop! 
Wow, you have such good eyes! Can I tell you about my last dream? [VAR(512, 0)]
Hmmm... My discerning eyes must have become weak...
I used to love Jump events. The record I have from when I was fully active as a Pokéathlete is 998 jumps! Just two more! All I had to make was two more! I had to retire due to my age... Could I ask you to jump 1,000 times for me? 
Well, the record may make you dizzy. But you’re still young. You can do it! I’ll just sit and wait.
Oh! You! It is so wonderful of you! You have jumped 1,000 times. Thank you so much! This is just a token of my appreciation. 
I’m now your fan. I’m old as you see, but I will support you no matter what.
You know what? I have tackled over 500 times finally! 
Haha! You’re doing fine, but not as good as me. I wonder if any Pokéathlete could be better at tackling than me. Sigh...
You know what? I have tackled over 1,000 times! Finally! 
You know what? I’ve finally tackled over 2,000 times! I bet no one can break this record easily! 
......! No! That’s not right! Your record beats mine? Nooooo! ...OK. You win. I admit complete defeat. Please take this. 
Whew! It’s strange, but I feel great. I do regret that I lost, but it made me know where I am. I understand that there are many Pokéathletes better than me. This is where I begin to grow again! Keep up the good work!

Young Pokéathlete! Hello! ... Running out of energy? Hello, again! Good! My name is Maximo! I am the Pokéathlon MC! Nice to meet you! I’ll be there for you when you need to know anything about the Pokéathlon. 
Maximo: Hello! I’ll be there for you when you need to know anything about the Pokéathlon. 
Do you have any questions? [VAR(512, 0)]
Which course do you want to know about? [VAR(512, 0)]
Which event do you want to know about? [VAR(512, 0)]
Let me explain the Pokéathlon! It’s the connection between Pokémon and Pokéathletes. It is friendship itself! ...What? You don’t get it? OK. I won’t be as brief this time. You are to form a team of three Pokémon to compete in ten different events! The friendship between Pokémon and Pokéathletes is tested! That is what we call friendship! Do you understand what I mean? 
I’ll explain “Hurdle Dash” for you. It is an event to test your speed. Your Pokémon needs to jump when the Hurdle comes near. If it jumps at the right time, it will go over the Hurdle! The total time of the three Pokémon gives you the event score. This is an event for speedy Pokémon that move quickly like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Pennant Capture” for you. Your Pokémon grab Pennants on the beach. Grabbing Pennants doesn’t add to your score. You have to come back with the Pennants. This is an event for speedy and skillful Pokémon that move like I do! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Circle Push” for you. Your Pokémon push others to try and stay in a Circle. You will get points as long as your Pokémon stay in a Circle. The total time of the three Pokémon gives your score. This is an event for powerful Pokémon with stamina that are strong like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Block Smash” for you. You smash Blocks as the name suggests. The number of Blocks you smash will be the score you’ll get. It’s so simple, isn’t it? This is an event for powerful Pokémon that are strong like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Disc Catch” for you. Your Pokémon jump and catch Discs that come flying toward them. The longer you wait before they catch the Discs, the more points you get. The total points will decide the score. This is an event for powerful and jumpy Pokémon that move like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any other questions? 
I’ll explain “Lamp Jump” for you. Your Pokémon bounce to jump high and touch as many Lamps as they can. The more Lamps they touch, the more points you get. The total points will decide the score. This is an event for jumpy Pokémon that are jumpy like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Relay Run” for you. Your Pokémon run in turns as far as they can in 90 seconds. The distance of the Relay will decide the score. This is an event for speedy Pokémon with stamina... Ones just like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Ring Drop” for you. Your Pokémon try to knock other Pokémon out of the Ring. A tackle gives you one point. A stomp on another Pokémon gives you two points. If your Pokémon knock another Pokémon off the Ring, making them drop, you get ten points. This is an event for Pokémon with stamina just like I have! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Snow Throw” for you. Snow Throw may not ring a bell but... how about a Snowball fight? The more your Pokémon hit other Pokémon with Snow, the higher the score will be. This is an event for powerful and skillful Pokémon... Ones just like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
I’ll explain “Goal Roll” for you. Your Pokémon try to roll the ball into the Goals of the other Pokémon teams. Most balls will give you one point. Gold-colored balls will give you two points. The number of points will decide your rank, and that decides the score. This is an event for powerful and skillful Pokémon... Ones just like me! Do you understand what I mean? OK, do you have any more questions? 
Young Pokéathlete! Don’t forget to do your Pokéathlon stretches before exercise!
Me? Are you interested in me? Hahaha! Oh, don’t be shy. Some people call me the “big brother”! But really, the big brother is... ... ... my twin brother! The “big brother,” as they say, is really the younger brother. So this “big brother” has a bigger brother... Do you get what I mean? 
RATTATA: Ratta.
RATTATA: Grrrr.
MACHOP: Awwwrr...
MACHOP: Yahhh!
BUTTERFREE: Fluttah fluttah...
BUTTERFREE: Bing bing!
The Pokéathlon is all about scores. No one knows who’s going to win until the last moment!

Y-y-you’re Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I have no clue how I could possibly reach where you are! You are the Pokéathlon itself!
Wow! That guy over there is Magnus, the Pokéathlon owner! I heard he once beat a MACHAMP at arm wrestling. Could it be true?
Yikes! Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I am a huge fan of yours! Oh my...what should I do? Can you give me an autograph?
Arrgh!

Oh my! It’s Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You look just like my son. I’m rooting for you.
Oh my! It’s Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You look just like my daughter. I’m rooting for you.
My boyfriend’s a Pokéathlete. But he’s so shy about it that I root for him behind a column so he won’t spot me!
Don’t you think he’s so cool dripping sweat just like his Pokémon? Not that he even compares to the great Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)], though.
Participate in the Pokéathlon to reduce stress. That’s the way to go!
Don’t you dare underestimate your mom. The look on her face when she was selling things at a bargain... It still gives me shivers! 
Every father longs to be a hero to their son. The Pokéathlon... Do I want to take it up? Just you wait and see, Son!
Ahh... My son! I’m so sad to hear that. Let me hear you say you want to be like your dad... 
My mom will finally participate. I was starting to worry because she never exercises. 
I’ll grow up to be a great Pokéathlete like you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! 
I’m cheering for you!
Are you Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? For real? I can’t believe it! 
I’m watching intently!
Are you Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? Tap... Tap... Tap... I can’t believe it! I touched my hero!
I didn’t expect so many rather old ladies like me participating. Maybe I can join them. It may be a chance to get close to my hero--Pokéathlete Jet! Hahaha!
Yeek!! Pokéathlete [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Every time you are in the game, my daughters’ eyes stay wide open! Could I ask for an autograph? ...No no! Not for me. It’s for my daughters. Ha ha!

About which course? [VAR(512, 0)]
Which event would you like to know about? [VAR(512, 0)]
In Hurdle Dash, timing is everything. Your Pokémon will pick up speed if you let them wait until the last moment before they jump the Hurdles. 
Pennant Capture... This event is not only about the Pennants on the beach, but also the ones other Pokémon have collected. If you bump into them from behind, they will be knocked down and your Pokémon will grab their Pennants. That’s the way experts fight. 
The key is to push other Pokémon out of the Circles...which may be obvious. Actually, your Pokémon can push harder if you pick the right moment to tell them to push. So you might be able to push back powerful Pokémon if you give frequent instructions to push. 
Block Smash is not just about smashing. Did you ever notice that sometimes there are small cracks in the Blocks? Well, if you can hit those cracks, they break real fast! If you can aim at cracks in a row, your Pokémon will feel great and they’ll show great potential. One more thing... When you make them switch, flick your Pokémon upwards for a quicker switch. 
Disc Catch is about how long you can wait until you catch the Discs. Bird Pokémon can move around in the air, so it’ll be easier to catch Discs if you form a team of bird Pokémon. 
Lamp Jump is not only about jumping. There are three Pokémon bouncing together, so one Pokémon can’t jump well if another comes down right when the other wants to go up in the air. Letting them jump at the right time is the key. 
Relay Run requires well-timed switching. Did you notice that Pokémon start to sweat a little when they become tired? It also indicates they have slowed down a lot. You shouldn’t allow them to sweat. Switching before they start to sweat, that is the key. 
It’s not easy to aim for the top by just tackling a lot in Ring Drop. Do you know what a “Body Attack” is? I call it a Body Attack, anyway... Your Pokémon can actually jump as it moves forward. If you can let your Pokémon Body Attack others, you can drop them off the Ring altogether! 
Snow Throw is not just about smashing. Are you making sure the Snowballs are big? Bigger Snowballs have a better chance of making other Pokémon fall down. You can also block other Snowballs from hitting your Pokémon by having your Pokémon hold on to some Snowballs. 
Goal Roll requires the skills of a Pokéathlete. The situation changes every second, but stay calm as you instruct your Pokémon. Positioning is key. I recommend keeping one at your own Goal to protect it--one in the middle of the field for flexibility and one in front of the Goal you want to roll the ball into. 
I hope you’ll become a Top Pokéathlete. Good luck!
Those who have won at the Pokéathlon 100 times are commemorated here for their achievement of creating the new, legendary record.
It is a cool Pokégear to commemorate your 100th victory in the Pokéathlon. That is your model! It is a special Pokégear with the Pokéathlon logo in the back.
Those Pokéathletes who have come in first in every event at the Pokéathlon 50 times are commemorated here for their overwhelming might and the arrival of a new legend.
It’s an awesome Poké Ball to commemorate your 50th victory in every Pokéathlon event. It’s your model Poké Ball! The engraving reads, “Stay on Top.”

Well, hello! It’s so freezing, isn’t it? For a youngster like you to be interested in the Sinjoh Ruins is not something we see every day. Take a look at them. From the design of the pillars at the Sinjoh Ruins, you can see that the cultures of Sinnoh and Johto have blended. 
What was I thinking? We don’t need to be standing here. Why don’t you come to the cabin around the corner for more discussion? 
By the way, we happen to have a person at the cabin. Any Trainer should know who she is. The famous Trainer from Sinnoh! She is traveling around to study myths and ancient ruins. Isn’t that something? 
                                 
Cynthia: Bring your ARCEUS only. Other Pokémon may get blown away by the strong power lingering at the ruins. 
Cynthia: It seems your ARCEUS is resonating in harmony with the Ruins. It might just be me but I can feel that... we are surrounded by strong power. The answer lies inside the ruins. The place that has been waiting for its rightful owner, the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)]... 
                 
The Sinjoh Ruins

===============================
Text File: 146
===============================
Cynthia: This is the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)]. The mythical stage built to show respect for ARCEUS. It is said that people used to celebrate its magnificent might with music and dance. Some people in Johto still pass down this tradition. 
Cynthia: This is the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)]. The mythical stage built to show respect for ARCEUS. It is said that people used to celebrate its magnificent might with music and dance. Some people in Johto still pass down this tradition.
Cynthia: The [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)] allows a single ARCEUS and nothing else to get on the stage... If you wish to go up there, you have to deposit your other Pokémon in a PC Box at the cabin.
Cynthia: Bring your ARCEUS instead. Any other Pokémon may get blown away by the strong power lingering at the ruins. 
Cynthia: This is where one might say, “The lead enters the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)] at last.” All my study of ruins and Pokémon mythology in Sinnoh may have been to bring you up on this stage here today... 
Cynthia: Depicted on the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)] are the Pokémon that shaped this world. The circle in the middle is ARCEUS, the origin of it all... 
Cynthia: According to an ancient document, time, space, and antimatter, or what combined we call the world, shall be born when ARCEUS stands on the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)]. 
Cynthia: This is the pattern that represents PALKIA, the master of space and dimensions... 
Cynthia: This is the pattern that represents DIALGA, the guardian of time... 
Cynthia: This is the pattern that represents GIRATINA, the ruler of the world that is on the opposite side of ours, the world of antimatter... 
Cynthia: ARCEUS has accepted you as a Trainer. ARCEUS, having shaped the world, is said to show you a glimpse of its true power. The power of possibly making life appear out of nothing... 
Cynthia: It seems that something will happen when you choose one of the circles... You’ll want to be well prepared.
Cynthia: Once you are ready, choose a circle and stand in the middle of it.
Cynthia: So you choose DIALGA, the guardian of time? [VAR(512, 0)]
Cynthia: So you choose PALKIA, the master of space and dimensions? [VAR(512, 0)]
Cynthia: So you choose GIRATINA, the ruler of the Distortion World? [VAR(512, 0)]
Cynthia: That shining sphere... Could it be...an Egg? Did we just witness the very moment an Egg was brought to this world? A moment no one has ever seen? 
Cynthia: An Egg is the cradle of every being. This planet itself is an Egg in a sense... Life that comes from an Egg will come to an end in due course... to begin anew... That may be what ARCEUS wanted to show us.  
Cynthia: That was...? 
Cynthia: We seem to be surrounded by that strong power again...! 
Cynthia: Of course... ARCEUS! So the source of the power I’ve felt was ARCEUS! 
Cynthia: What is now the [VAR(65280, 1)]Sinjoh Ruins [VAR(65280, 0)]was built to honor ARCEUS by the Sinnoh people... It’s an icebound temple that has been waiting for ARCEUS for hundreds of years... 
Cynthia: This is the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)]. It is designed to bring out the power ARCEUS possesses. 
Cynthia: ARCEUS is described in mythology as being the origin of everything and the source of all beings. It is said that the power of ARCEUS is released on the [VAR(65280, 1)]Mystri Stage[VAR(65280, 0)]! 
Cynthia: The [VAR(65280, 1)]Sinjoh Ruins[VAR(65280, 0)] are what remains of a temple built to show respect for ARCEUS.
The mysterious round object took the shape of a Pokémon! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] obtained the [VAR(256, 1, 0)]!
Will you choose DIALGA? [VAR(512, 0)]
Will you choose PALKIA? [VAR(512, 0)]
Will you choose GIRATINA? [VAR(512, 0)]
This place does not seem to respond...
It seems that only a single ARCEUS can stand here...
Would you like to give a nickname to the [VAR(256, 1, 0)]? [VAR(512, 0)]
It seems it no longer responds to this ARCEUS...

Cynthia: My name is Cynthia. I am a Pokémon Trainer. The [VAR(65280, 1)]Sinjoh Ruins[VAR(65280, 0)] remind me of Sinnoh, where I come from. Initially, I thought it was because it snows a lot here as well. But that was not it. A long time ago...people came from Sinnoh to live here. They must have built a temple here while longing for home. That’s why we call these the [VAR(65280, 1)]Sinjoh Ruins[VAR(65280, 0)]... 
Cynthia: You are... a Pokémon Trainer? I can sense strong power coming from your Poké Ball... 
Cynthia: I wouldn’t assume you managed to get here by yourself. This is a heavy-snowfall area where the snowbound land freezes you to the core... Talk to the old man if you wish to go back. ABRA should be able to take you where you come from.
Cynthia: I feel a familiar presence... The power of DIALGA... PALKIA... or could it be GIRATINA? It’s similar, but not quite the same... 
Cynthia: Have you got time? Can you come to the [VAR(65280, 1)]Sinjoh Ruins[VAR(65280, 0)] with me? Call it a Trainer’s intuition. When you and your Pokémon step onto that stage, something will happen. 
     
Cynthia: The snowbound ruins make me wonder... Time and space change, and we with them. We leave some things behind and give each other company... Sinnoh, Johto... When you feel you’re close to understanding the whole world, you are merely drowning in your own miniscule perception. 
A long time ago, people used to draw life from Pokémon and also give their lives to those Pokémon... That shows that people and Pokémon used to be more closely bonded with each other. When people moved from place to place, the myths and legends of Pokémon and their power would also be carried with those people. That’s how myths and legends from each region are blended with each other. The ancient ruins here have inherited the legends from both the [VAR(65280, 1)]Ruins of Alph[VAR(65280, 0)] in Johto and the [VAR(65280, 1)]Spear Pillar[VAR(65280, 0)] in Sinnoh. That is proof that people from Johto and Sinnoh blended together as a group.
ARCEUS is said to have come out of an Egg. Johto people believe that Pokémon Eggs are the vessels of life, and thus something astounding. Places far from each other can share similar myths and legends... That’s quite interesting, isn’t it?
Well, hello! We meet again! Cynthia has gone back to Sinnoh. She is the Sinnoh League Champion. She studies various ruins despite her tight schedule. How wonderful she is!
You seem so out of place, not even knowing why you are here. Do you want my ABRA to use a special power to take you home? [VAR(512, 0)]
OK. OK. Picture your house in your mind... 
OK... OK... The best of luck to you!

Thorton: Bzweeeeep! Sorry, don’t mind me. What I’m using is an invention of mine. It’s my data-interpreting machine. It’s telling me what you’ve rented for this match. I see! You’ve rented [VAR(256, 0, 0)], [VAR(256, 1, 0)], and [VAR(256, 2, 0)]. I have to say, that’s a good setup. Like, say, [VAR(307, 3, 0)] percent? Oh, don’t let that number concern you! All righty, let’s get going! 
Thorton: Bzweeeeep! Let’s see what I can see about you through my data-interpreting machine. So, what have you rented for this match...? I see! You’ve rented [VAR(256, 0, 0)], [VAR(256, 1, 0)], and [VAR(256, 2, 0)]. I have to admit, that’s a good setup. It’s a combination of friendship with cooperation all around. I’d say it’s like [VAR(307, 3, 0)] percent? Oh, don’t let that number concern you! All righty, let’s get going! No losing for me this time! 
Thorton: Hmm... I got handed the loss here. It’s not making me happy at all, losing. Even though I’m not happy, I did glean some useful data, I suppose. That makes me glad I battled you. So, did you get to like those Pokémon you rented? As the Factory Head, it would sure make me happy if you did. Next time, come back with different rental Pokémon. 
Thorton: Hmm... I got handed another loss. It’s not making me happy at all, this. In fact, I’m stewing here. I thought I learned a lot about Pokémon since I lost to you. But that’s all right. Some things you learn from winning. But some things you learn by losing. I hope you’ll keep renting our Pokémon and give me a chance to redeem myself!

... ... Yaaaaaaawn... ... Huh? It’s already become so bright outside! 
... ... Yaaaaawn... ... Huh? What?! Is it already that late?! Oh no! I overslept! 
... ... Hmm. Looks like the sun is descending in the sky... ...So this would be what is called “twilight,” wouldn’t it? 
... ... Hmm... Interesting... ... Huh? Oh! Excuse me, sorry! I was just reading this book here. 
... ... Yaaaaaaawn... ... Huh? A guest? At this hour? 
Sorry to keep you waiting! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! My name is Professor Oak. But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor. Before we go any further, I’d like to tell you a few things you should know about this world! 
I will first tell you important things about this game.  Please touch any topic you’d like to know more about on the lower screen.
                                  
I’ll explain this game’s controls.  You can control this game by touching the lower screen, also called the Touch Screen.  Please touch the panel in the bottom right of the Touch Screen.
By touching the Touch Screen like this, you can confirm selections and advance conversations.
You can also advance by pressing the A Button when you see the A Button icon on the Touch Screen.
Different touch buttons will appear on the Touch Screen depending on the situation.
Next, I’ll explain the button operations.  You can move the main character around on the screen using the +Control Pad.
Next, I’ll explain about buttons.  Use the +Control Pad to move the main character.  You can also use the +Control Pad to select entries.
You can operate the screens using buttons instead of touching the Touch Screen.
Used to confirm a choice, check things, chat, and scroll text.  Used to exit, cancel a choice, and cancel a mode.
Use this to move within menus.  Press to use a Key Item, such as a Bicycle, that has been registered in advance.
                    
                                  
                                                                                                           
                                                        
                                                                     
If this mark is shown in the message window, there are active buttons you can touch on the Touch Screen below.
                         
[VAR(512, 0)]
Do you understand everything so far? [VAR(512, 0)]
                                 
You are about to enter a world where you will embark on a grand adventure of your very own.
Speak to people and check things wherever you go, be it in towns, roads, or caves. Gather information and hints from every possible source.
New paths will open to you when you help people in need, overcome challenges, and solve mysteries.
At times, you will be challenged by others to a battle. At other times, wild creatures may stand in your way.  By overcoming such hurdles, you will gain great power.
However, your adventure is not solely about becoming powerful.
On your travels, we hope that you will meet countless people and, through them, achieve personal growth.  This is the most important objective of this adventure.
This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon. 
We humans live alongside Pokémon as friends. At times we play together, and at other times we work together. Some people use their Pokémon to battle and develop closer bonds with them. 
Now, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
Are you a boy? Or are you a girl? Won’t you please tell me? [VAR(512, 0)]
So, you’re a boy then? [VAR(512, 0)]
So, you’re a girl then? [VAR(512, 0)]
Please tell me your name.
Your name is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? [VAR(512, 0)]
Your name is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? [VAR(512, 0)]
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Are you ready? Your very own tale of grand adventure is about to unfold. Fun experiences, difficult experiences, there’s so much waiting for you! Dreams! Adventure! Let’s go to the world of Pokémon! I’ll see you later!

We’ll return the Pokémon we kept for you. Here you go! 
Don: Got it? I’m going to win! Don’t bother me.
Don: Luck plays a big part in this. You never know if Pokémon will appear.
Don: You won? The winner is you!? I’m so jealous... It’d be fantastic to be the winner...
Ed: My PARASECT makes Pokémon fall asleep with Spore.
Ed: You can’t win with Pokémon that are run down or low on HP.
Ed: I envy you. I just couldn’t do it this time.
Abby: I’ve been training Pokémon that inflict status problems for this contest.
Abby: I heard that using Pokémon with beautiful colors makes it easier to win. I wonder if that’s true?
Abby: Wonderful! You sparkle and gleam right now. You really do!
William: Winning? I’m more interested in finding rare Pokémon.
William: Well, I’m satisfied because I caught a Pokémon I wanted.
William: You’re the winner? What did you catch? Show me, show me!
Benny: ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... Ssssh! You’ll scare off SCYTHER. I’ll talk to you later.
Benny: Listen, I caught a SCYTHER before, but I didn’t win.
Benny: I just came to see how things were going today, you know? I’ll really try my best next time!
Barry: You should weaken bug Pokémon first, then throw a Poké Ball.
Barry: It’s easier to win if you get a high-level bug Pokémon. But I think they also consider some other points.
Barry: That Pokémon you caught... It’s awesome!
Cindy: I really love bug Pokémon!
Cindy: I really love bug Pokémon! Did I already say that?
Cindy: Congratulations on winning! By the way... Did I mention that I really love bug Pokémon?
Josh: I’ve been collecting bug Pokémon since I was just a baby. There’s no way I’m going to lose!
Josh: I heard that somebody won with a CATERPIE!
Josh: It’s called a Bug-Catching Contest, not a Bird-Catching Contest! You, of all people, should know that. After all, you won!
Samuel: What? If you’ve got the time to chat, go find some bug Pokémon.
Samuel: So... I thought I would score higher...
Samuel: It’s so disappointing... I won’t forget this defeat, and...
Kipp: I’ve studied bug Pokémon a lot. I’m going to win for sure.
Kipp: I study a lot, but that’s not enough to win.
Kipp: Could you give me some tips? I want to win!

Welcome to Fast Ship S.S. Aqua. ...Except that the engine-maintenance team is taking some time off, and we don’t know when we can depart...
Welcome to Fast Ship S.S. Aqua. May I see your S.S. Ticket? 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] tried to show the S.S. Ticket... ...But no Ticket here! 
I’m sorry... Another person without a Ticket wouldn’t make much of a difference, I think. But a rule is a rule. Sorry, kiddo.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] flashed the S.S. Ticket. 
OK, you have a Ticket! We’re departing soon. Get on board quick! 
What? You already showed me the Ticket.
Welcome to the S.S. Aqua! Your Ticket is...right there. Please come through. 
Operating a ship every day can wear you out! It’s not running today. It leaves for Vermilion City on Mondays and Fridays!
Professor Oak: Hello! You are starting to have the attitude of a Champion, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! It’s time for your Pokédex to match who you are. Let me see your Pokédex for a second. I’ll upgrade your Pokédex with the National Mode.

[VAR(259, 0, 0)]’s Pokédex was upgraded with the National Mode!
Professor Oak: It won’t be easy to complete the National Pokédex... However, I’m sure you will make an honest attempt on our behalf! 
Oh, time flies! I have a radio show to record at Goldenrod Radio Tower. You must be heading for Kanto. If you come near Pallet Town, do drop by my Pokémon Research Lab! 
The S.S. Aqua uses jets to travel. It skims over water!
You’ve been to Kanto already? I hear many rare Pokémon live over there. Sounds exciting. I’d love to visit!

OK! You must be the last passenger. 
Huh? Doesn’t seem like the ship will be moving anytime soon.
If I manage to come back safely from this journey and take my first steps in Olivine City, will you live there with me? Please! I beg you!
He’s only a crewman of a pleasure cruise. He has a way of exaggerating things. 
Sabrina: Out of the blue... I get the urge to see the ocean... It may be fun to exchange numbers with you... Do you want mine? [VAR(512, 0)]
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] registered Sabrina in the Pokégear!
Sabrina: I think I can keep my promises if you call me on Sundays around noon.
Sabrina: I see... I thought you’d make a good friend.
Sabrina: Now you want to know my number? I can see it in your eyes... [VAR(512, 0)]
Sabrina: It’s you... How about a picture here against the pleasant sea breeze? [VAR(512, 0)]
Sabrina: Are you ready? 
Sabrina: I think it looks good.
Sabrina: I see... I thought you’d make a good picture subject...

Whoa! Excuse me. I was in a hurry! My granddaughter is missing! She’s just a wee girl. If you see her, please let me know! 
Here’s your cabin. If your Pokémon are hurt, take a nap in the bed. That will heal them.
Here’s your cabin. You can heal your Pokémon by taking a nap in the bed. The ship will arrive while you’re sleeping.
Most passengers are Trainers. They’re all itching to battle in their cabins.

Captain, play with me, please? I’m bored! I want to play more! 
Wow, you are going to play with me? Let’s play hide-and-seek! I’ll hide, so close your eyes!

Wow, you are going to play with me? Let’s play hide-and-seek! I’ll hide, so close your eyes! 
This little girl keeps asking me to play with her. Ouch! Please don’t stretch my ear!
Thank you for playing with her. You may think being a Captain is a somewhat easy job, but it’s actually quite demanding. That little passenger has gone out of the room. She can’t get off the ship, so she must be hiding somewhere around here.
How do you like S.S. Aqua’s ride? She practically skates across the waves.
Long time no see. How are you doing? The S.S. Aqua is as smooth as she can be! By the way, I found this mysterious thing when I went to Sinnoh the other day. Now that we’ve met again, I would like you to have it. 
Your Bag is full. You must like the [VAR(264, 1, 0)] a lot.

Zzz... Zzz... Wh-what? I’m awake, of course... Zzz... Zzz...
What? You’re saying I was asleep? Show some respect! A crewman on duty would never be so unmindful as to take a nap in a place like this! I resent your implication! I challenge you! 
Losing to you has woken me up. I will mend my ways and work hard. Can you keep it a secret that I was taking a nap here? Please don’t tell the Captain.

I see. So you are playing hide-and-seek wih my granddaughter. I guess there is no need to worry as long as she’s on the ship!
Oh, hello... My granddaughter is still missing. If she’s on the ship, that’s OK. She’s an energetic child, so she may be bothering someone. That worries me...
Grandpa, here I am! I was playing hide-and-seek with this guy! 
Grandpa, here I am! I was playing hide-and-seek with this girl!

Hey, kid. Could I get you to look for my buddy? He’s taking it easy somewhere, that good for nothing! I want to go find him, but I’m on guard duty and have to stay right here.

You win... [VAR(284, 0, 0)]!
[VAR(284, 0, 0)] was the one thing I wanted to avoid...
Waaah! [VAR(284, 0, 0)]!
I want to go home with [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]! [VAR(284, 1, 0)]!
Could it be...? [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...?
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]! How awful!
I was confident about [VAR(284, 0, 0)], too.
You’re [VAR(284, 0, 0)], aren’t you?
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]! Can’t be anything else but.
I feel so helplessly angry... It’s [VAR(284, 0, 0)]!
[VAR(284, 0, 0)] makes me sad...
I feel sorry for [VAR(284, 0, 0)]!
The way I feel now is [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...
I lost, but I won at [VAR(284, 0, 0)]!
I would’ve won if this were [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...
My head’s filled with only [VAR(284, 0, 0)] now!
The way I lost... It’s like [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...
Isn’t [VAR(284, 0, 0)] [VAR(284, 1, 0)]?
Aww... That’s really [VAR(284, 0, 0)]...

Smash! Crash! Shatter! I was born to smash Blocks! 
There’s nothing I can’t smash! I am the Pokéathlon Destruction King! 
There’s a huge wall over there I’m sure! It’s just there for me to smash! 
Keep breaking Blocks...and you’ll notice the mountain over there. 
My body just automatically catches any Discs that come my way! 
I’ve come to catch Discs and catch the Pokéathlon!

Bring it on. I’ll catch it! I’ll catch any Disc that comes my way! 
The jump was like the wind! The form was like a cloud! 
Jump high to the sky! The form is weightless! 
A Pokéathlete that can read the flow of the wind and control the air. 
There’s no border between the ground and the sky within me! 
There’s no one who can stop me! I was born to run! 
I’ve never seen strength like this! Just running all day long! 
Once I get moving, I can’t stop! I’m in a perpetual Pokéathlon! 
My engine is friendship, and my motor is victory! 
There’s no chance! I’ll knock down all Pokémon competition! 
Getting in the Ring is the end! Fight to be the last Pokémon standing! 
Ruler of the Ring! Enter another’s Ring at your own risk! 
What exactly are you anyway? That’s what the Ring will tell you! 
Throwing Snow is the best in the world! With that kind of accuracy, you can win! 
The Snowballs we’re throwing are rolled-up balls of friendship! 
Such rapid-fire throwing! Who’s that Snowball for?! 
I don’t know where it will leap from next! The Snowballs seem to split! 
No one can stop this ball! It will hit any Goal I aim for! 
Use that wonderful teamwork and make the Goal! 
Such splendid footwork! Aim for success! 
Live with the ball. Live inside the ball! 
Give the points as a gift to them. It’s the embodiment of fair play. 
Smile even when you miss! The Pokéathlon isn’t just about winning! 
You don’t hesitate to aim for your own Goal! 
Don’t fight over who rolled the ball into your Goal! It’s your friendship! 
Why do you stand out like that? Winning is not the only thing in the Pokéathlon. 
Here it is! What you’ve all been waiting for! Autographs after the competition! 
If you want to see me win, I’ll show you just how I win! 
When I do my best and win, I make everyone happy!

Ah! Your Pokémon trusts you very much. It’s nice to see a good Trainer. Here. A gift for your journey. 
TM37 happens to be Sandstorm. It’s a move that inflicts damage on both your and your foe’s Pokémon. However, some Pokémon, such as Rock- and Ground- and Steel-type Pokémon, take no damage. There are other ways to avoid taking damage. I’ll let you figure it out.

When you want to go fishing, face the water and use the Rod first. Then concentrate and look closely at the water! An “!” appears when a Pokémon has taken a bite! Press the A Button quickly to pull back on the line. You’ll see what happens next. If there’s water, be it the sea or a stream, try out your Rod.
Oh. That’s rather disappointing...

You open your Pokégear and press the radio button. Then you see the screen for tuning in a signal. The middle of the screen is the radio-reception map.

Well, hello! It’s said that past this hole used to be a huge tower reaching far into the sky. They say that it was a rather strange tower with half of it embedded in the cliff. It was not just a tall tower reaching up to the sky, but also reaching deep down underground! It is rumored that it even reached the bottom of the ocean! In short, the ruins used to connect the sky, the land, and the sea to each other... Most of the tower is now crumbled, and the only things that remain are the entrance and its interior, where you’ll see strange patterns.
I think this building may have been built to enshrine Pokémon with a strong connection to the sea, the land, and the sky.
A masked guy who looks great in front of a huge torrential waterfall... That’s me, Crasher Wake! Who dares to talk to me so freely? Oh! You are that mask-fanatic Trainer I saw at the Celadon Dept. Store! 
Wake: I heard about the great waterfall near Cianwood and decided to come see it. This waterfall is awesome! No human or Pokémon can survive without water, yet that same water can sometimes cause great suffering. 
Wake: You must be a Trainer from this region, right? I hope you’ll become a Trainer with the qualities of water-- strong, tough to beat, yet refreshing. Good luck, mask-fanatic [VAR(259, 0, 0)]!

Announcing the top 3 in Vermilion City! Number three is... Ta-da! The construction site!

Pokémon Search Party
Narrator
What has our fearless staff witnessed? It’s the Pokémon Search Party!
The Variety Channel that’s a treasure trove of laughter and tears!
At the end of the day, our search party’s efforts were in vain. They eventually had to leave the deep and dark Union Cave. “If only we had Flash!” the leader cried. Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion to the special program, “The Cave Plunged into Darkness”!
At the end of the day, our search party’s efforts were in vain. We weren’t able to find any UNOWN... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “Solving the UNOWN Puzzle!”
The search-party leader looked up at the Johto sky and shouted a promise. “We won’t fail again!” It mixed with the sad cries of the SLOWPOKE that echoed continuously... Yawn... Yaaawn... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “The Dark Shadow that Kidnapped SLOWPOKE!”
The forest was dark and gloomy. We could hear the crunching of fallen leaves under our feet. “Leader, this is a dead end!” “Don’t worry, let’s retrace our steps.” “Where’s the exit?” “Come on, we can do it!” “Let’s just go back already...” “You’re a guy, aren’t you? Quit whining!” “Leader, your back...” “What?!” “On your back, a Bug-type Pokémon...” “Eeeeek!” Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “Great Strategy in Ilex Forest!”
The leader of the search party looked out at the Lake of Rage, quietly muttering “There’s no such thing as unstoppable rain.” He held the Fishing Rod that had been snapped in two tightly in his hand, and headed back to headquarters. Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “Look! A Red Gyarados!”
The inside of the cave was covered in a thick ice, just like a freezer. “Aaaahchoooo!” The search party members shivered in the cold, and huddled around the fiery PONYTA for warmth. They were able to beat the cold... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “The Shivering Path Out of Ice!”
The voyaging search party tried to think of a solution to the puzzle, but their thoughts were interrupted and washed away by the sound of the waves around the Whirl Islands. The shadow of a huge Pokémon shifted and shook in the violent sea filled with whirlpools... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “The Legend Disappeared into the Whirlpool!”
The forest was brighter than they thought it would be. And they saw so many Trainers there. “Hey, a Bug Catcher!” “What?” “He’s challenged us to a battle!” “Then accept his challenge!” “But we don’t have any Pokémon...” “Simpleton!” Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “The Viridian Forest Search Party!”
We heard that there were Pokémon here, but we haven’t seen any yet. We’ve come all the way here to Mt. Moon, as a search party looking for Pokémon. We’ve been waiting, spending time here, and yet the day that we see a Pokémon hasn’t come yet... When will we see one? What kind of Pokémon will come to Mt. Moon? Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “Rumors on Mt. Moon!”
The members of the Pokémon search party are riding their Bicycles on Route 17 and singing. Looking at their faces, they seem to be relaxing and cycling along as they please. But they’re actually doing this to search for the Pokémon along the route. Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “Illusion Cycling!”
The search party has become lost! In this strange world, up has become down, and left has become right! Then suddenly, right before the confused search party’s eyes, it appears! GIRATINA! There’re so few accounts of anyone ever meeting this Pokémon. It rarely appears. But comparing GIRATINA to the few records that exist, it’s appearance is different... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “The Strange GIRATINA!”
The search party has gone on a long expedition out to the Sinnoh region. The giant Mt. Coronet, rising up to the sky from the middle of Sinnoh... Within Mt. Coronet stretches a complex system of caverns... Some members of the search party struggled through the caverns, only to ultimately arrive at a broken bridge. They thought they’d found ancient ruins. There was a strange feeling in the air... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “Found it! The Illusion Space!”
The search party had just about reached the limits of its physical strength, when it came to Cerulean City to rest. “Look, such a beautiful sunset...” “Leader! Look over there!” The member was pointing at a suspicious-looking cave! The search party went to explore, and found a strange flickering shadow... Tune in next time for the exciting conclusion in the special program, “The True Shape of the Cave’s Owner!”

Trainer Profiles
Snap
We’re always watching you! It’s time for Trainer Profiles!
That town, this town, bringing people together. The Street Corner Channel.
This boy loves Bug types! He’s so energetic, and he doesn’t mind running through thick grass to catch Bug-type Pokémon! He does what he wants, on the hills and in the fields, this Bug Catcher!
These two are always together. They have the same birthday. They always eat together. Do you think you can tell them apart? These Twins!
Flying majestically through the sky. Rejecting the land for the open air. Gracefully flapping its wings. Riding the wind to soar high into the sky. I want to fly there, too, sometime! The Bird Keeper!
Singing in the cabin. Laa... Laa... La la la la... The plan is to take a three-night, four- day holiday. To fish off the boat, hike in the mountains, and look for EEVEE to the east and west. That’s the Camper!
Greeting you with a peace sign, stuffing drinks into a cooler, smiling brightly while hiking through the mountains, you can see her clearly on the horizon. Oh no! Forgot the lunchbox! The number one rule is to protect nature. The Picnicker!
Accidentally inhaling a little ocean water, he now has a sore nose. Swimming around the rocks, pushing ahead with a breaststroke, tirelessly swimming along, and getting a leg cramp! His lungs expand easily but it’s an unlucky day-- it’s raining! That poor Swimmer!
A silhouette like that of Venus. An adorably dazzling smile. A nickname of “Mermaid.” Swimming around carefree in the early afternoon. Feeling hungry but on a diet. The number of enthusiastic fans. Droplets of water in her dimples. Playing in the water rather than taking a walk, this Swimmer!
Dropping a line in the cold water, in the hopes of catching something big. The line is yanked. The float drops underwater. What was caught? Some lively rubber boots! This poor Fisherman!
The day has come to an end, but it’s still bright. That’s strange, you’d think. There’s an intense fire burning, and it looks like it’s going to burn them. He doesn’t need a candle. He’s a human ablaze, carelessly playing with fire. The Firebreather!
This is so cool isn’t it, this Pokémon? The tail is such a great shape. Want to trade figurines? Want to come over and see my collection? Oh hey! This mark is in the wrong place. Looks like I fell for a counterfeit... But it’s art anyway! That’s a Poké Maniac!
I can break ten roof tiles in one chop! Some people think I’m just a hooligan. The palm of my hand becomes covered in blisters. I never forget to bow, and I shout out to psych myself up! I’m the Black Belt!
Hold it close, cheek to cheek. I always want to be with you, surrounded by wonderful Pokémon. I’ll mutter your name. So happy, I’m dizzy. I love Pokémon! That’s a Pokéfan!
A strong guy on a boat, plunging on through the waves. Dancing and singing and having a merry old time. But gentle as kittens once they get back on land. That’s a Sailor!
Had plenty of success. Learning through constant repetition. Recklessly carrying around notebooks. Attending classes for gifted kids. A wonderful Pokémon Trainer, that School Kid!
Hey kid, get out of my way! If you hang around, I’ll smack you! Get out of the way. Out of the way. My Bike is coming through! It’s so very loud, you’ll cover your ears! We’ll line up and get in the way. Go ahead. Try to stop us Bikers!
Yaho... Yaho... Yahohoho... Singing in a loud voice without worrying about what’s around. A bearded man shouts out to the sky. From the far mountain. Yahohoho... So happy that the echo came back to the Hiker!

Congratulations, Trainer! In recognition of your outstanding skill, our Frontier Brain is demanding a match with you. So, your next match is against the Arcade Star; no ifs or buts! Are you ready? 
Dahlia: No need to worry. ♫ Let chance do what it does. Like surprises from the game board, life goes through twists and turns. No need to worry. ♫ Things will go as they will. But, enough of that. I know one thing for certain. You have arrived here not merely because you were lucky. Let us not waste any time. I wish to test your skills myself! 
Dahlia: No need to worry. ♫ Let chance do what it does. Like surprises from the game board, life goes through twists and turns. No need to worry. ♫ Things will go as they will. But, enough of that. You are proving yourself incredible. Are you incredible because you are so lucky you shrug off bad luck entirely? Or, are you so incredibly talented to not be swayed by luck, good or bad? I wish to see for myself what brought you to me today! 
Dahlia: How fabulous of you! Your love of Pokémon shone through, and, in turn, your Pokémon believed in you. That is why you handled everything thrown your way splendidly. A most wonderful victory it was! 
Dahlia: Truly, it was so very fabulous of all of you! Bad luck, you cast aside, and good luck, you netted. That you did so is evidence of your abilities. By defeating me, Dahlia, you have proven your mastery brilliantly! I am sincerely happy for having this battle against you!

I’m the Day-Care Man. We look after the precious Pokémon of other Trainers. If you’d like us to raise your Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it’s you! We were raising your Pokémon, and my goodness, were we surprised! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! We don’t know how it got there, but your Pokémon had it. You do want it, don’t you? [VAR(512, 0)]
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you. Your [VAR(256, 0, 0)]’s doing just fine.
Well then, I’ll hang on to it. Thanks!
You have no room for it right now... Come back when you’ve made room.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Egg from the Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
                                                                                
                              
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you! Your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] and [VAR(256, 1, 0)] are doing just fine. 
I really will keep it. You do want this Egg, yes? [VAR(512, 0)]
Take good care of it! That is, I don’t think we’ll ever find another... No, no, I’m sure we’ll find another one. I’m definitely sure of it! 
Well all right then, I’ll take it. Thank you. That is, I don’t think we’ll ever find another... No, no, I’m sure we’ll find another one. I’m definitely sure of it! 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]... If we are looking after your Pokémon and notice one is holding an Egg, would you like me to contact you by phone? Would that be all right? [VAR(512, 0)]
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]... If we are looking after your Pokémon and notice one is holding an Egg, would you like me to contact you by phone? Would that be all right? [VAR(512, 0)]
You can leave it up to us! Any Pokémon you’d like to have raised you can leave in my wife’s care.
I see. Well, that’s fine. Any Pokémon you’d like to have raised you can leave in my wife’s care.
The two seem to get along very well.
The two seem to get along.
The two don’t seem to like each other much.
The two play with other Pokémon rather than with each other...
I’m the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. Would you like us to raise your Pokémon? [VAR(512, 0)]
Which Pokémon should we raise for you? 
Fine, we’ll raise your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] for a while. Come back for it later. 
We can raise two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise another? [VAR(512, 0)]
Ah, there you are! My husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then. Come again.
You don’t have enough money...
Do you want to take back the other one, too? [VAR(512, 0)]
Very good. Come again.
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you. Now, about your Pokémon... 
By level, your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] has grown by about [VAR(307, 1, 0)]. 
Your Pokémon team is full. Make room, then come see me.
If you want your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] back, it will cost $[VAR(309, 1, 0)]. [VAR(512, 0)]
Excellent! Here’s your Pokémon. 
[VAR(259, 1, 0)] took [VAR(256, 0, 0)] back from the Day-Care Lady. 
Oh? But you only have one Pokémon with you. You can’t go off without a Pokémon. Come back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back? [VAR(512, 0)]
If you leave me that Pokémon, what are you gonna battle with? Come back another time.
Huh? Now, now. If you leave that Pokémon with me, you’ll be left with just one. You will be better off if you catch some more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now. That is merely an Egg!
Fine, we’ll raise your [VAR(256, 0, 0)] for a while. Come back for it later.
     
       
      
      
     
The two seem to get along very well.

Will you battle against the Hall Matron?
Excuse me! Please hold on a moment. In recognition of your remarkable winning streak, our Frontier Brain is demanding a match with you. Actually, you have no choice. You must battle our Hall Matron! 
Argenta: My Battle Hall allows Trainers to mount challenges with their one preferred Pokémon. I imagine there were tense moments getting here with your chosen one. But understand that one shines the brightest when a challenge is overcome. I am Argenta, and I am your final and most daunting challenge. I dare you to overcome my challenge. 
Argenta: Well! My goodness, your Pokémon... It’s got star power beyond belief. Even from inside its Poké Ball, I can feel its charismatic brilliance. But I’m the Hall Matron. I’ll be the judge of that. I must battle it for myself and see if that brilliance is genuine. That is why we must battle now. 
Argenta: A good Trainer doesn’t force their preferred Pokémon on anyone. A good one keeps with their favorite without drama or fanfare. That is how I see it, at least. And, by the way I see it, you’re an excellent Trainer! Be sure to visit the Battle Hall again with a favorite Pokémon. Until then, bye-bye! 
Argenta: You must never forget there is a place where everyone can shine. That goes for any and every kind of Pokémon, too. Spread that message in your own words. It’s one everyone should hear. And now, having lost, this lady has nothing left to say at all, but... Bye-bye! 
Please select what type of Pokémon you’d like to battle.

Professor Oak: The legendary Pokémon that appear in the Hoenn myth? You must be talking about KYOGRE and GROUDON! 
Professor Oak: The Embedded Tower is probably the ruins that has something to do with the Hoenn myth. If so, the other one must be around. KYOGRE and GROUDON are said to have shaped the seas and lands! Where those two are, the other Pokémon is said to appear as well... All this is quite possible! 
Professor Oak: It’s not hard to imagine that the Red Orb will make GROUDON appear at the Embedded Tower... However, according to Mr. Pokémon, GROUDON does not show itself to Trainers with golden hearts, but only to those with shining-silver spirits. It may be difficult for you alone to accomplish this, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. But if you manage to obtain a GROUDON that came from the Embedded Tower, please do come and show me both legendary Pokémon! I will then share with you the rest of the Hoenn myth!

Professor Oak: You did it, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You caught both KYOGRE and GROUDON! OK! I would like to entrust this to you! 
Professor Oak: It resembles the Orb you received from Mr. Pokémon, doesn’t it? It is called the Jade Orb. It has something to do with RAYQUAZA. Legend has it that the battle between GROUDON and KYOGRE shaped the lands and seas of Hoenn. Volcanic eruptions and giant waves are said to have completely changed the shape of the land there. But then RAYQUAZA came down to halt the battle. It is a Pokémon that rules the skies! If the Embedded Tower is related to KYOGRE and GROUDON, then going there with that Jade Orb will surely make something happen. 
Professor Oak: Go to the Embedded Tower with the Jade Orb! 
Professor Oak: You have successfully caught RAYQUAZA! The strong power of the Jade Orb must have attracted RAYQUAZA there! Pokémon are sometimes greatly attracted by certain Orbs and Stones. No one knows why. Perhaps memories from ancient times... when this planet was born... and Pokémon, also... are making Pokémon behave that way. 
Professor Oak: Hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! The study of Pokémon never ends. It is such pure joy to work toward perfection! By the way... Hmm? Those Pokémon! They were at the Embedded Tower?

Welcome to Trainer House, the newest and most happening place in Viridian. We’re open to Trainers only. You can battle against the best of the best right downstairs.
Viridian is the town closest to Indigo Plateau. They built this place because so many Trainers pass through on their way up to Indigo Plateau.
They hold practice battles downstairs here. I would love to see how well a Trainer from Johto battles.
You go all over the place and battle all kinds of Trainers. This is not just to train your Pokémon. This is also a chance to experience many things yourself. I bet the Champion from Pallet Town went to all the cities and towns in Kanto.
Whew... I’m taking a rest from Pokémon battles.
Practice battles are held in the Training Hall downstairs. Skilled Trainers are invited to participate. Communicate with your friends through the Pokéwalker to bring them here! Be aware that you cannot bring them here once you are downstairs!
Trainer House Rules 1. You can challenge various Trainers     once a day. 2. All Pokémon over Level 50 become     Level 50 for the battle. 3. You cannot use items from your Bag. 4. Afterward, your Pokémon will recover     and the held item will be restored. 5. You cannot earn experience from     the battle. 6. You earn Battle Points instead! Skilled Trainers are invited to participate.

It was as if the Bike were cursed and trying to drag him into oblivion! ... ... Shrieeeek! The boy had been riding uphill on Cycling Road! ... Ba-dum, ba-dum!

Spell Tag boosts the power of Ghost-type moves. It won’t slow your Bicycle, so don’t worry!

Yo, legend in the making! Whoops! Take a good look around you. The Trainers all look like the Gym Leader, Janine. Which of them is the real Janine?
That was a great battle, Trainer from Johto!

Welcome to the Pal Park! This is where top-notch Trainers who aren’t satisfied with the Safari Zone come to show their Pokémon-catching techniques to their peers. ...Oh? Are you maybe... Ah, you are [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! My dad told me about you! Word is, you’re a hotshot Trainer! We’d be honored if you would participate in our Catching Shows. [VAR(512, 0)]
Yes! You agreed to participate! Let’s not waste any time! Let me explain how Pal Park works. What should I explain? [VAR(512, 0)]
Pal Park is a place where you are timed on the catching of six Pokémon. You are provided with six special Poké Balls for the challenge. Participating Trainers are required to supply the six Pokémon that are to be caught. If you do not supply the stock of six Pokémon, you may not participate in the Catching Show. ...Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
At the start of the Catching Show, you will be given six Park Balls. Use the Park Balls to catch the six Pokémon you provide. ...Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
Insert a Game Boy Advance Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen in the Game Pak slot. Six of the currently caught Pokémon can migrate from the Game Pak to the DS Game Card when your DS is turned on and you select “MIGRATE FROM...” Please note that you cannot insert a GBA Game Pak into a Nintendo DSi to migrate. ...Would you like to know anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
Would you like to take part in a Catching Show now? [VAR(512, 0)]
Aww, that’s too bad. Well, just give me a shout again if you’d like to participate.

Oh, hold on. You don’t have enough Pokémon for a Catching Show. You’ll need to stock us with six Pokémon to participate. You should make some Pokémon migrate from Hoenn or another region!
Yes! You agreed to participate! Let’s not waste any time! Let me explain how Pal Park works. What should I explain? [VAR(512, 0)]
I’m sorry you had to retire. I’ll take what Park Balls you have left. Next time, please do stay to catch all six Pokémon.
Oh, your PC Boxes are filled. You have no room for six more Pokémon. You won’t be able to accept them, even if you do catch them. Make enough room in a PC Box and come back for your Catching Show.
Congratulations! That’s all six Pokémon caught! The audience sure enjoyed watching your Catching Show. All right, let’s see your all-important score from this show! ... ... Catching Points: [VAR(309, 0, 0)]! Time Points: [VAR(309, 1, 0)]! Type Points: [VAR(309, 2, 0)]! The total is... ... ... [VAR(309, 3, 0)] points! 
Wow! That’s an outstanding record! Kudos to you! 
Good! That’s a decent record. Props to you! 
Would you like to put all caught Pokémon in PC Boxes? [VAR(512, 0)]
Done! Your Pokémon have been boxed away. You’ll now have to save the game. 
Oh, then it might be fun for you to go for an even better score by trying to catch these six again. If you want to do another Catching Show, just come see us!
If you want to do another Catching Show, come see us again, please! 
It’s time for your prize! Here you are! 
Do another Catching Show with the same Pokémon? [VAR(512, 0)]
The current record holder is [VAR(259, 1, 0)] with [VAR(309, 2, 0)] points. Can you top that?
Oh! You’ve topped 2,000 points! You’ve earned this, then! 
Keep working on getting a higher score!
Oh! You’ve topped 2,500 points! You’ve earned this, then! 
Oh! You’ve topped 3,000 points! You’ve earned this, then!

Your Bag is full. You should come back later.
I’ve heard Trainers complain that rare Pokémon take longer to appear. Is it easier to start with common Pokémon?
Oh, me? No, I never catch Pokémon myself. But I enjoy Catching Shows a lot. I love to see Johto and Hoenn Pokémon, especially. The regions I’ve never been to are so mysterious.
I feel so happy that I’d like to share my happiness with you today. I must crown you with this... Crown. Oh, before you get the wrong idea, it’s an Accessory for Pokémon.

But before the Poké Ball was invented, people used to walk with Pokémon. Just like your friend Lyra does! Poké Balls are great because you can carry many Pokémon. But walking with Pokémon must have some advantages. It could have something to do with how Pokémon grow or evolve... So I’m going to give you a Pokémon! Can you walk beside this Pokémon, outside of its Poké Ball, to see if this brings any special feelings or bonds between Pokémon and people? The device over there has some Pokémon you could choose from...

Hmm... One of the ears is spiky... That’s strange. There seems to be something more to it. It really is a rare sight. 
You met it at the Ilex Forest? A mysterious Pokémon called CELEBI has been sighted there, or so I heard. 
Speaking of that... 
Professor Oak once wrote about CELEBI and [VAR(65280, 1)]Time Travel[VAR(65280, 0)] in a research paper he presented at a conference!

Ohh... I’m sorry. I forgot that you weren’t wearing the Running Shoes! I’ll try to go as slow as possible, so try keeping up! 
This is a Pokémon Center. They heal your Pokémon in no time at all. You’ll be relying on them a lot, so you better learn about them. 
This is a Pokémon Mart. They sell Poké Balls for catching wild Pokémon and other useful items. 
Route 30 is out this way. Trainers will be battling their Pokémon there. If you go a little farther, you’ll see Mr. Pokémon’s House. 
This is the sea, as you can see. Some Pokémon are found only in water. 
Here... It’s my house! For your effort keeping up with me, I’ll give you my Running Shoes! They’re still warm! ... ... Got you, didn’t I? Don’t worry, these are brand new!

... You got a Pokémon at the Lab. What a waste. That’s a Pokémon that’s too good for a wimp like you. ... Don’t you get what I’m saying? Well, I too have a good Pokémon. I’ll show you what I mean! 
... Do you want to know who I am? ... I’m going to be the world’s greatest Pokémon Trainer.

Did you talk to the old man by the Pokémon Center? He’ll put a Map of Johto on your Pokégear.
When you’re with Pokémon, going anywhere is fun.
Mr. Pokémon’s house is still farther up ahead. You could use the Running Shoes if you had a pair. But beware of wild Pokémon and Trainers! When you run, the noise will attract them.
I battled the Trainers on the road. My Pokémon lost. They’re a mess! I must take them to a Pokémon Center.
A Pokémon I caught had an item. I think it’s Mystic Water. I don’t need it, so do you want it? 
Back to fishing for me, then.

Falkner: I’m Falkner, the Violet City Pokémon Gym Leader! People say you can clip Flying-type Pokémon’s wings with a jolt of electricity... I won’t allow such insults to bird Pokémon! I’ll show you the real power of the magnificent bird Pokémon! 
Falkner: ...For pity’s sake! My dad’s cherished bird Pokémon... But a defeat is a defeat. All right. Take this official Pokémon League Badge. This one is the Zephyr Badge. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)] received the Zephyr Badge from Falkner!
Falkner: With that Badge, Pokémon, including traded Pokémon up to Lv. 20, will obey you without question. It also enables you to use the hidden move Rock Smash anytime outside of battle. 
Falkner: By using a TM, a Pokémon will instantly learn a new move. Think before you act--a TM can be used only once. TM51 contains Roost. It restores half the max HP. There are Pokémon Gyms in cities and towns ahead. Make good use of them! As for your next move... I would suggest Azalea Town.
Falkner: There are Pokémon Gyms in cities and towns ahead. You should test your skills at these Gyms. As for your next move... I would suggest Azalea Town. I’m going to train harder to become the greatest Bird Keeper of all!
Yo! Champ in the making! You must be here to challenge Falkner, the Gym Leader, right? You are quite welcome. ...Almost! This city has a tower called the Sprout Tower where Trainers come to train themselves. Challenging Falkner may be too difficult if you haven’t gone through their training. Ha ha ha!
Yo, Champ in the making! I’m no Trainer, but I can give some advice! Believe me! If you believe, then a Championship dream can come true. You believe? Then listen. The Grass type is weak against the Flying type. Keep this in mind.
Nice battle! Keep it up, and you’ll be the Champ in no time at all!

Read which topic? [VAR(512, 0)]
If poisoned, a Pokémon steadily loses HP. The poison lingers after the battle, and HP is lost as you walk. To cure it, use an Antidote. 
Paralysis reduces speed and may prevent movement. It remains after battle, so use a Parlyz Heal. 
If asleep, your Pokémon can use only certain moves, such as Sleep Talk and Snore. A sleeping Pokémon doesn’t wake up after battle. Wake it up with an Awakening. 
A burn consumes HP, little by little, and also reduces the Attack stat. A burn lingers after battle. Use a Burn Heal as the cure. 
If your Pokémon is frozen, it can’t do a thing. It remains frozen after battle. Thaw it out with an Ice Heal.

They built the new Radio Tower to replace the old, creaky one.
Have you visited the Pokéathlon Dome? It is a huge sports facility where Pokémon compete with each other. It was quite a sight!
I know there’s a new Bike Shop, but I can’t find it anywhere.
The fact that you have a Bike... means you got it from a Bike Shop, right? All right! I can say that there is a Bike Shop somewhere in this city!
Is that man in black dressed up like a Team Rocket member? How silly!
Was that man in black really part of Team Rocket? I can’t believe it!
The Radio Tower in Goldenrod City is a landmark. They’re running a promotional campaign right now. They’ll modify your Pokégear so it can also serve as a radio.
The Radio Tower in Goldenrod City is a landmark. They’re running a promotional campaign right now. They’ll modify your Pokégear so it can also serve as a radio. Oh, your Pokégear works as a radio!
E-he-he-he... I got in trouble for playing in the basement of the department store.
The man at that tent rates your Pokémon names. He can even rename your Pokémon.
I think I’ll give my Pokémon cool nicknames as a reward if they do well in the Pokéathlon.
Whew! This is one big town. I don’t know where anything is.
I know that you can find the Pokéathlon Dome when you take Route 35 north and go past the left gate... But I seem to get lost every time I come to this town...
So this is the Radio Tower... 
What do you want, you pest? Scram! 
What are you doing? Get to your position right away! 
Pokémon? They’re nothing more than tools for making money!
We are on guard here. Don’t you worry!
Take over the Radio Tower... What? It’s none of your business!
You look awfully young... Are you new?
Hey, brat! You don’t belong here! Get lost!
Hey, hey! I’ve got this covered! Why don’t you go to the Radio Tower?
Friendship with Pokémon? That makes me laugh!
Our dream will soon come true... It was such a long struggle...
Who are you? A newcomer? We’ve run out of Team Rocket uniforms. One of my guys is going to get more... What’s taking him so long? The studio in the tunnel is just around the corner.
For a young one like you to decide to become a member of Team Rocket... That’s great, kiddo!
Get out of my way! We, as Gym Trainers, will never allow Team Rocket to do nasty things here in our city!
Tee hee! You Gym Trainers can be a problem. Stay in the Gym and stay out of the way!
The Gym Leader, Whitney, went flying by saying, “I have got to get a Radio Card!”
Wh-what are you trying to do? Can’t you see this cool, pitch-black uniform I’m wearing? You’re not afraid of Team Rocket? Huh?
You don’t appear scary enough to be a Team Rocket member in that uniform... Make a scarier face and say, “Yeee!” All the while, clenching your teeth!
Where do you think you’re going? We are right in the middle of the mission!
Where do you think you are going? The Radio Tower is not here!
The GTS lets you trade Pokémon all over the world! ...Except that we have something more important to do right now!
If you love to trade so much, wait until the Radio Tower mission is over. Then you’ll have plenty of time!
Slow down! I’m the only one who was sent here. Don’t give me any more trouble, OK?

Whitney: Hi! I’m Whitney! ...You! I saw you at the Radio Tower just now. Everyone was into Pokémon, so I got into it, too! Pokémon are super cute! You want to battle? I’m warning you--I’m good!

Whitney: It’s Attract! It makes full use of a Pokémon’s charm. Isn’t it just perfect for a cutie like me? That’s right! I heard that this thing called the Pokéathlon Dome is now open right next to the National Park. You should go try it, since you’re so good at battling with your Pokémon!
Whitney: Ah, that was a good cry! Come for a visit again! Bye-bye!
Oh, no. You made Whitney cry. It’s OK. She’ll stop soon. She always cries when she loses. 
Yo! Champ in the making! This Gym is home to Normal-type Pokémon Trainers. I recommend you use Fighting-type Pokémon.

The Colosseum upstairs is for link battles. Battle records, such as how many times you had link battles and the results, are recorded on the back of your Trainer Card.
Oh, you are a Team Rocket member...
I wonder how many kinds of Pokémon there are in the world. A long time ago, Professor Oak said there were 150 different kinds... Since then, many new Pokémon have been discovered in different regions. There are almost 500 different kinds known now...
Team Rocket...!
A higher level Pokémon doesn’t always win. After all, it may have a type disadvantage. I don’t think there is a single Pokémon that is the toughest.
I think I’ve met you before... You must have a reason for looking like that...?

It looks really happy! It must love you a lot.
I get the feeling that it really trusts you.
It’s friendly toward you. It looks sort of happy.
It’s quite cute.
You should treat it better. It’s not used to you.
It doesn’t seem to like you at all. It looks mean.
I keep losing in battles, and my Pokémon end up fainting... Maybe that’s why my Pokémon don’t like me much...
When I use an item on my Pokémon, it acts really glad!

You will be asked to put up the Pokémon you are offering to trade. At that time, you will be asked what Pokémon you would like in return. If another player offers your desired Pokémon in return for your offered Pokémon, the trade will go through. Should I explain anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
You may search among the Pokémon that are offered by other Trainers. They will all identify what Pokémon their Trainers want back in return. If you find one that you want, you must provide us with the kind of Pokémon wanted in return. Should I explain anything else? [VAR(512, 0)]
Would you like to make a global Pokémon trade? [VAR(512, 0)]
Please do visit again.
I hope you enjoy your visit to the GTS! 
...Uh-oh! I’m sorry, but your team and all your PC Boxes are full. If you wish to use the GTS, you must have room on your team or in a PC Box.
...Uh-oh! You only have one Pokémon with you. If you wish to use the GTS, you must have at least two Pokémon with you. Please come back with more Pokémon on your team.
Such a small world it is, eh? Eh? Wait, this is a miniature? The real Earth is millions of times bigger than this? Whoaaaaaaa!
They say if you communicate with someone, their location is recorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon here to trade. Who knows, it might be traded while I’m asleep tonight.
Using the equipment here, you can easily trade Pokémon with other Pokémon fans on the other side of the world! That’s incredible!
You can register where you live on this giant globe. Once you do, you can show your location to anyone you communicate with.
Nintendo WFC is so easy to use, even I can trade Pokémon now!
This week, I’ll do it! I really want to make the Top 4 of the rankings.
The Global Terminal has three floors. You use warp panels for getting from one floor to another. A blue panel takes you to the GTS on the ground floor. Take a green panel to the studios for Box Data and Dress-Up Data on 2F. Take a pink warp panel to the third floor for the Battle Video Gallery.

Why? It’s not fair! Why are there only shots of Pokémon? Why aren’t there any shots of ladies? I call discrimination!
Climbing the mountain to enjoy its great view is one thing... But sneaking a peek at other people’s PC Boxes fills me with a guilty glee.
Did you know? About my PC Box, I mean. It’s full of Pokémon everyone longs for, like... ...No, it would be immodest for me to say. It would sound like bragging. If you really must know, you can always find out yourself.
I visit every day to check on other people’s Dress-Up Data. For me, it’s like the first step to fashion!
Oh, dear me! Gracious! This is almost scandalous!
For combinations of Pokémon and Accessories, you can get ideas from others by observing what they do.
The same kind of Accessory can create entirely different impressions. It really depends on where and how it’s used.
I won a Backdrop drawing for Accessories in the Goldenrod Tunnel.

What you see here is how much people around the world love Pokémon. Watching Battle Videos lets you share the fun these people had.
This is a great idea. Anyone and everyone can participate. Even if you lose, that battle could still become an outstanding Battle Video.

My Battle Videos starring only cute little MARILL are the ones I like best.

To treat one’s self to Battle Videos every day... I would consider that a hobby worthy of a true gentleman.

Speaking of weaklings, the city’s Gym Leader isn’t here, and is supposedly taking care of a sick Pokémon at the Lighthouse. Humph! Boo-hoo! Just let sick Pokémon go! A Pokémon that can’t battle is worthless! Why don’t you go train at the Lighthouse? Who knows? It may make you a bit of a better Trainer! 
Dark roads are dangerous at night. But, in the pitch-black night, the sea is even more treacherous! Without the beacon of the Lighthouse to guide her, no ship can sail.
That thing you have-- it’s a Pokégear, right? Wow, that’s cool.
Wow, you have a Pokémon! That is just so awesome.

Jasmine, the Gym Leader? She’s at the Lighthouse. She’s been tending to a sick Pokémon. A strong Trainer is compassionate at the same time...
Jasmine uses Steel-type Pokémon. She’s trying to hide her tenderness behind her steely coldness.
That was awesome. The Steel type, huh? That was one heated battle you had!
I knew you’d come here. Thank you for helping the Gym Leader, but battle is a separate matter. Go for it!
Impressive! You should continue your journey to different places. Since you can use Surf, why don’t you try it on the Lake of Rage?

They say that they will start the construction work to rebuild this tower soon!
Oh! That’s a nice Pokémon you’re walking with! They make you feel uplifted, don’t they? They give us the hope of the light, so to speak. Speaking of the light, I heard something about the Lighthouse in Olivine. The Pokémon that serves as the beacon has fallen ill. Sounds like it’s in trouble.
The Pokémon at that Lighthouse in Olivine has fully recovered. I heard that boats can safely sail out to sea at night again.
If you go west from this city, you’ll reach a port called Olivine City. When your Pokémon learns Surf, you can go out to the ocean from Route 40 without a ship!

Only those who possess the Rainbow Wing are given permission to go up to the top of the Bell Tower... But the rainbow-hued Pokémon will not come down for just anybody who goes up there. There must be something else you need. I’ve heard the Kimono Girls know something about it.
The Johto region has two legends. One is the legend about Whirl Islands. The other is the Bell Tower legend... We have been passing down the Bell Tower legend for generations in Ecruteak City.
The Bell Tower shook! It must be HO-OH... HO-OH must have returned to the top!

That’s Surf. It’s a move that lets Pokémon swim across water with ease. 
Not only are the Kimono Girls great dancers, they’re also skilled at Pokémon. But they battle only for good reasons. I don’t know if you could defeat them if they showed what they can do...
PSYDUCK: Dau dau!
That man’s always with his PSYDUCK. Says he wants a Pokémon that can Surf and dance. Is he trying to make a Pokémon that stars at synchronized swimming?
Oh... Ouch...! This stomachache! I wouldn’t let this guy act like that were it not for this pain...!

The Kimono Girls are so beautiful... But they have to go through rigorous training. And they have to learn to follow customs before appearing in public. But if you love something, anything is possible.
To do such a terrible thing to a Kimono Girl! I don’t understand how young people behave these days.
Quite the Trainer for your age indeed!

Ecruteak was also home to three Pokémon that raced around the town. They were said to have been born of water, lightning, and fire. But they could not contain their excessive power. So they say the three ran like the wind off into the grassland.

Hi... This is Buena. I can’t come to the phone right now. If you want to chat, tune into Buena’s Password on the radio and give me a call after midnight!
I’m thinking of going to the Game Corner tomorrow. It’s been a while. You know, I have this great strategy for playing... I always do great! Huh? Nuh-uh, it’s my secret! You’ll have to figure it out yourself! Catch you later!
Hey there! You use your Pokégear to listen to the radio, right? I heard that you can even display town maps with the Pokégear. I have a bad sense of direction, so the Pokégear would be handy... Anyway, thanks for calling! Later!
Is it sunny outside today? When you’re cooped up in the Radio Tower as much as I am, you lose touch with the outside. It can be boring. Please call again!
Oh. Hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! You are how? Aiyee! This isn’t the time for me to be cracking silly gag greetings! The Radio Tower is in deep trouble! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], you’d better be careful!

The other day, I went out to eat with DJ Ben! Isn’t that great? Not only that, he said the music on my show is cool! Oh, wow! Like, what should I do? ...Oops, I have to get ready for my show! I’ll catch you later!
You know the receptionist at the Radio Tower? “Welcome” is all she ever says. But she’s really the chattiest person at the Radio Tower. So she must be holding back. Isn’t that fun to know? Catch you later!
Have you won the Pokémon Lottery held on the first floor at the Radio Tower? You get more chances as you trade Pokémon with different friends.
You know, last night... I was so stressed out from work, I ate a ton of junk food! Mary and I have this deal about losing weight... This won’t do... Huh? What’s her weight? This has to be a total secret! Mary weighs... Aiyee! M-Mary! Uh... Um... I... Sorry, wrong number!
Yesterday, Professor Oak was in the studio to tape his show. So I went over and introduced myself. Get this--he tunes in to my show! I hope he’s in again tomorrow!
...Cough, cough! Uhm sorry uh got uh code dite now. Buh uma pro so uh hav to cover id ub so no un notice while uhm on air. Uh fidz muh voice now. I’ll catch you on the fly. This has been Buena!
Hey, there. You won that Radio Card by beating the quiz at the reception desk, didn’t you? Guess what? I made up the questions! ...Were they too easy for you? Well, let’s chat again!
I’m elated that more people are taking part in my password show. But when PIKACHU was the password, it was uh...whew...overwhelming. Fan Club people came out in droves, shouting “PIKACHU!” over and over. I mean, they were loud. Anyone tuning in around then must have been shocked by the racket! Anyway, back to work for me! Let’s chat again!
Guess what? The Radio Tower’s Director is a big fan of TV! A while ago, a fashion show on TV said that brown suits were in. Now all he wears are brown suits. But it’s a secret that our Director is a TV fan, so if you see him, don’t you dare mention it! Oh! The Director will be here soon! Later! Tune into my show!
Now, tell me. When do you relax the most? For me, it has to be in the studio right after my show, enjoying a nice cup of tea. It’s so pleasant that it gradually makes me drowsy... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ......Zzz Oops, I drifted off just thinking about it! How, uh...embarrassing! Please forget this happened! Later!
Tell me, what was the first Pokémon you ever caught? ...Oh, really? I’ve seen lots of Pokémon around, but I’ve never caught one. I should give it a try sometime. Did you know that the first Pokémon Mary caught was a DROWZEE? Isn’t that so out of character? But Mary’s DROWZEE kept making her fall asleep on the job, so she traded with a fan for a MEOWTH. Let’s chat about Pokémon again! Bye-bye!
Did you know...? Ben talked with the radio staff on the phone for hours about what Pokémon music they should play on different days of the week. Toward the end, Ben’s musical tastes were kind of impressed upon them. They ended up enduring Ben’s overenthusiasm for a while. They said they even kind of enjoyed it! Let’s chat again!
I’m going shopping with Mary soon. It’ll be great if the Goldenrod Dept. Store has a sale when we go... Say, maybe we can go together, too! Catch you later!
Guess what? All of us from the Radio Tower are going on a company vacation to the Radio Tower in Lavender. We’re wasting our vacation on a trip to another Radio Tower? I’d much rather go to the beach! [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I hope you have enough fun for both of us on your journey! Bye-bye!

Hey, aren’t you visiting all kinds of places, helping out Professor Elm? That’s so cool. Seriously, I’m jealous. If I ever got a vacation, I know I’d just go traveling all over the place as I pleased. Oh no! Gotta get back to work! Talk to you later!

Hello... Um, hey, what’s up? I’m doing great over here...totally! 
There are so many Gym Leaders that are stronger than me... Um, I really need to work harder and improve!
I’m often bored Saturdays at noon. There’s nothing to do... Um... So, call me Saturday, OK?
Yeah, I’m bored! Nothing to do! Oh, yeah! You wanna battle me again? [VAR(512, 0)]
For sure! I really want to battle, too. Um, you know where to find me... the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.
What’s that? Um, bo-ring...
Um, really? You really have time to battle me? Don’t break a promise you made to someone else--that’s not fair!
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. Broken promises are unforgivable, get me?
Um, this is Whitney. How are you? 
Don’t forget you promised to meet me at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. You’re not gonna make me wait, are you?
Um, have you ever been to the Moomoo Farm off Route 39? My Milky... Um, I mean, my MILTANK, is staying over there now...
Um, I’ve gotta tell you, I’m so hungry... Do you know how it feels? I’m not an overeater or anything! This is completely normal for my age!

Many of the Gym Leaders are much stronger than I am. We’ve just got to work harder!
My schedule’s fairly open on Monday afternoons. Would you mind calling me back then?
I can hear you clearly now. Say, my schedule just opened up. Would you like to meet for a battle or something? [VAR(512, 0)]
Super! I’m burning up, ready to fight! I’ll be waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City!
Oh, I getcha... You’re afraid to face me... Nah, that’s not true, right?
You’re sure you want to meet me for a battle? Don’t you have kind of a full schedule, with other appointments?
I’m waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City! Come on! Move like the wind!
This is Janine. How are you doing? 
Remember, you promised to meet me at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. I’m ready whenever you are...like, now!
Hey, can I talk to you about my dad? Only if you want to hear, though. Seriously? I might talk your ear off if I’m not careful!
See, I’ve been training with my dad since I was little--to be a Gym Leader. I haven’t even considered taking any other path, really. It’s my dream to someday become a better Gym Leader than Dad!
Falkner in Violet City... He’s talking about his dad all the time! Seriously, he’s such a daddy’s boy, he needs to become his own person sometime, you know? What do you mean, I should talk? Ha ha--mind your own business!

There’s a lot of Gym Leaders who are way stronger than me. We’ve both got to work harder!
My schedule’s fairly open on Sunday mornings. Try calling me then, OK?
I’ve got some free time right now. Would you like to meet for a battle or something? [VAR(512, 0)]
Yay, I’m happy! I’ve got another thing to look forward to now. I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.
Oh, I see...
Huh? Wait, didn’t you already make enough other appointments before you called?
I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. Please don’t forget!
This is Erika. How are you? 
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City... You haven’t forgotten, have you?
Do you like plants? Plants are such delicate things. The amount of water, the condition of the soil, the temperature differences, the changing weather... All those little things we don’t think about can have such a huge effect.
Do you like telling fortunes? Me... I don’t really like the kind where you pull off flower petals... Oh, but it’s not that I dislike the fortune-teller in Lavender Town.
What do you do on your days off? I like to tend to the plants in my Gym, transplanting them and dusting off the flowers and leaves with a brush. It keeps me pretty busy...

If it’s not Sunday night, then I’m not available. Call then or forget about it!
I was just looking for something to do! Wanna battle me again? [VAR(512, 0)]
Whatever! I won’t lose to you again, got that? I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.
Whatever. Sounds like you’re pretty busy yourself.
Wha...? Oh, c’mon... Haven’t you made plans with enough other people?
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. C’mon, show a little initiative here!
I’m Blue. 
Remember we made plans to battle at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City? Wha...! Did you seriously forget? C’mon, I don’t have all day!
When I look at Pokémon, I get a strange feeling--you ever get that? There’s round ones, square ones, flying ones, swimming ones, flaming ones, freezing ones, shiny ones, dark ones-- there are so many different types, and yet, they’re all Pokémon. I mean, like Pokémon, there’s not just one type of person, either... But it’s still kind of strange when you think about it.
Anyway, you’re really something. Traveling all by yourself, visiting all these different Gyms you find and beating them all... Well, you’re not really alone... You’ve got Pokémon with you!
Man, this guy called Red brought me down in a heartbeat. I haven’t seen him in a long time... I wonder where he is and what he’s up to... Come to think of it, you look a little bit like Red. Yeah, you do. Just... Just a little bit. Whatever...

Are there any Gym Leaders you haven’t battled yet? Step up! Get on it!
Let’s see... I’m free Saturday mornings usually. Please, give me a call then.
I was hoping for an invitation! We’re battling again, correct?[VAR(512, 0)]
Excellent! Glad to hear it. I’m looking forward to this. I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City!
Sure, sure... I know you’ve got a busy schedule...
I’ve got to say this... Before we battle again, how about you keep any promises you made to others first?
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City! That was a promise!
Hey, this is Falkner. How are you doing? 
You know our plans to meet at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City? That’s still on your mind, isn’t it?
My dad told me something when I was a kid. He said “Falkner, bird Pokémon don’t just fly with their wings, they soar through the sky because that’s what they want to do with all their heart.” That’s just like my dad.
The scaffolding in my Gym was in bad shape when you came to battle, eh? Every year, we give the place a thorough scrubbing. It’s a challenge. But the bird Pokémon help us out, so we’re able to manage.
You’ve chatted with Janine in Fuchsia City, haven’t you? All she ever talks about is her dad, you know? Endlessly. I mean, it’s good to have a healthy respect for your dad, but it’s better to have some self-confidence! Don’t you have faith in your own abilities?

Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? ...I think we have a bad connection. Could you try again from another spot?
Nice to hear from you. How is everything with you? I’m good. 
There are a lot more stronger Gym Leaders than me... So get tough or go home!
What’s your point? If you want to battle me again, fine. Friday nights, take it or leave it. Call me then... Maybe I’ll answer...
Well, well, you called at the right time! You want to battle again? I’m up for it.[VAR(512, 0)]
Ha ha ha. It’s great that you’re stepping up. I’ll be waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City!
What in the world? Are you trying to make fun of me?!
You figure you want to battle me? I’m wondering if you have time enough to do me justice. I hear you made promises to meet some other people. You should respect those first, is what I think.
I’m waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City... Don’t wuss out.
Yes, it’s Clair here... Oh, hi. How are you doing? 
Keep in mind we’re meeting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. It’s a promise I’m waiting to keep...
Lately some people from the Radio Station came around, wanting to do a piece on me, or something. My fans definitely won’t want to miss watching that! Oh, no! I was confused! It’s radio! All those people tuning in, and they won’t be able to see my glorious face! What about TV? Why hasn’t a TV crew come to do a piece on me?!
Lately there seems to be some gossip running through town that I am the latest name in fashion. Well, if I’m that cool that people can’t stop talking about me, I can totally understand that sentiment.
Wow, you seem like you’re a pretty busy person, aren’t you? Even more than I am, if that could possibly be. I mean, I’ve got my Gym work, and I’ve got to go see the Elder at the Dragon Tamer’s shrine, too. What do you think? You’ve got talent--you could become a Dragon Tamer, too. Think so?

We both know there’s much stronger Gym Leaders than me around, right? You’d better be ready to work hard.
I’m really sorry, but I’ve got a lot going on... I’m pretty busy lately... Well, Wednesday mornings I’ve got some free time. Want to try calling then?
Oh hi, I’m free today! Let’s battle again, OK?[VAR(512, 0)]
OK! So, I’ll see you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City, then!
Aw... That makes me sad...
I’m not sure... Are you making plans just with me? Didn’t you make some plans with someone else already?
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. If you stand me up, I’m going to be sad.
Yes, this is Misty... Hi, how are you? 
We made plans to meet at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. You remembered you’re meeting me? I’ve been so looking forward to this...
Hey, have you traveled through all of the Kanto region yet? How is it, compared to Johto? There’s a lot of beautiful scenery here, right? I especially love the Cape along Route 25! I’ve got so many memories of things along that coast... What kinds of memories? Pfft! Like I’d tell you!
That reminds me... That strange person who came to visit my Gym recently... That was you who defeated him and sent him off, wasn’t it? I forgot to thank you for that! Everyone in my Gym is really appreciative. Thanks so much!
Hey, did you hear? If you beat all six people on Route 25, not losing even once, you get to make a true-love wish! You didn’t hear about that? Really? Well, that would be because I just made it up! Ha ha ha!

Huh? I can’t hear you very well. We must have a bad connection. Try calling again from somewhere else!
Hello... Oh, hey, what’s wrong? You don’t have to worry about me. How are you doing? 
Have you visited every Gym yet? There are Gym Leaders you haven’t battled yet, aren’t there?
I don’t do anything at all around noon on Tuesdays. You should give me a call then sometime if you’re free.
Woah, hey! You called at just the right time! Wanna battle me again? Come on, whadda ya say? [VAR(512, 0)]
Woah, hey! Thanks! I’ll be waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.
Woah, hey! That’s cold!
Look, I appreciate that you want to battle me again, but didn’t you already make plans with somebody else?
Woah, hey! I’m waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. 
Hey, this is Blaine. What’s up? 
We made plans to meet and battle at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City, right? I’m waiting for you!
You know, even if you lose your Gym, if you take rocks and stones and pile them up one by one every day, sooner or later you’ll have built a really nice replacement Gym! I’ve made it my life’s mission to build another Gym.
I am grateful that Trainers flock to a homemade Gym like mine... I thank you too for coming all the way just to battle me!
I kind of like the Seafoam Islands a lot lately. The problem with that is if you decide to go shopping, there aren’t any stores there...

What? I can’t hear you very well. Maybe we’ve got a bad connection? Try calling again from somewhere else.
Hello? What’s up? I’m doing great! 
Aren’t there any other Trainers you’d like to battle more than me?
My free time? I’m usually available Friday mornings. Try calling me again then!
Hey, you! Battle me again! What do you say? [VAR(512, 0)]
All right! I’ll be waiting for you in Saffron City’s Fighting Dojo. Don’t be late!
I see... You must be pretty busy.
Hmm... Well, I appreciate that you want to battle me again, but didn’t you promise someone else?
I’ll be waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. Don’t forget! Come on!
Yo! This is Lt. Surge. How are you? 
Hey, did you forget that I’m standing in the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City waiting for you? I guess I got here before you. I’ll be waiting!
So, why do you think I put all those traps in the Vermilion Gym? That’s right! It’s to test the intellect of any Trainer who comes in to battle! Pokémon battles aren’t just about power or stamina. If you can balance power and intelligence, then you’ve got the makings to become a great Trainer!
When I was fighting for my country, I helped raise a lot of Trainers, taught them the ropes. But! By the time you met me, you’d already perfected your abilities! Where did you train? Who taught you how to battle? It’s so strange and amazing!
I’ve been studying this region’s dialect during my time as Gym Leader here in Vermilion. But there’s still so many sayings that I don’t understand. Hey, will you talk with me some more? We could teach each other some new things to say!

Hello... What’s going on? I’m doing great. 
There are stronger Gym Leaders than me out there. They’re all waiting to cheer you on!
That’s right... If we were to have another battle, then we’d need to do it when I’m free, like on Tuesday nights. Give me a call then.
I’m competely free today. Why don’t we have a battle? [VAR(512, 0)]
All right! Do you know where the Fighting Dojo is in Saffron City? I’ll be waiting there.
I see... Well, you’ve got your own plans as well, I understand.
Hey! Before you battle me again, don’t you have someone else you promised to battle with?
I’ll be at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. Get ready and meet me there!
This is Morty! How are you doing? 
Hey, didn’t we make plans to meet at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City? I remembered! You didn’t forget, did you?
The legendary Pokémon: Suicune, Entei, and Raikou--which do you like best? Unlike Eusine, I don’t really have any interest in Suicune. So I’d have to say Entei... But I can’t leave out Raikou... Hmm... Guess I can’t make up my mind.
You know, I once saw Entei. I mean like up close. It was amazing. Entei looked me in the eyes. I’ll never forget its eyes. It was like it could see right through me, down into the depths of my heart...
How have you been? Anything interesting happening? I’m doing the same as usual, just my regular Gym Leader duties. There haven’t been any really strong Trainers here since you came through. Seems like you’re one of those genius Trainers you seldom meet. Ha ha ha! I don’t mean to flatter you!

Hello? I can’t hear you very well... We must have a bad connection... Try calling me again from a different location, please.
Hello... How are you? I’m doing well, thanks. 
There are so many other Trainers out there who are much stronger than me... You should challenge them and see.
Let’s see... I’m usually free on Wednesdays around noon. I could spare some time... Why don’t you call me again then...
Amphy’s gotten better lately. I’ve also been able to take some time to myself. What do you think? Would you like to battle me again? [VAR(512, 0)]
Got it... Well, I’ll see you in Saffron City at the Fighting Dojo, OK?
I see...
Huh? Before you battle me again, don’t you have other appointments to keep?
Got it. I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. I’ll see you there.
This is Jasmine. How do I sound? Healthy? 
You didn’t forget about your promise to meet me for a battle, did you? I’m still waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City...
Have you been to the Lighthouse lately? I’ve been so busy myself. I haven’t been able to get over there to see Amphy much... But...whenever I see the Lighthouse’s lights at night, I always think, “I hope you’re doing well, Amphy.”
Um... There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you... What did you think of my Gym? Was the atmosphere a little strange? But...I mean, steel always looks pretty cold and uninviting, but I was trying to make it at least a little cute.
Warden Baoba at the Safari Zone... He came over to my Gym once to introduce himself... He talks a little differently, doesn’t he? I heard it’s called anastrophe...

Hello... Anything new going on with you? I’m the same as usual. 
There are stronger Gym Leaders than me, you know. That’s no good!
I think I’ve got some free time on Sundays around noon. Could you call me back then?
Ah, wonderful! I’ve got some free time right now. Would you like to battle again? [VAR(512, 0)]
I knew it. That’s just like you. So, I’ll see you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City then!
I see... You have the right to refuse an offer. I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up. But I’m still a little disappointed...
Do you really have some free time to battle me? If you’ve got plans with other people, you should really do that first.
I’ll be waiting in Saffron City’s Fighting Dojo. Don’t forget!
Yeah, this is Sabrina. How are you doing? 
So, I’m pretty sure we made plans to meet at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City... Did you really forget?
I’ll tell you a little about a Psychic’s training. Psychic ability is the power to influence people. You close your eyes and clear your mind of excessive thoughts...then you look hard at your sleeping self. That’s it. True Psychics aren’t the kind who can move things around with their minds. It’s about controlling your own mind.
You... You’ll become even stronger than you are now, I know it... You will defeat every Trainer you face and eventually reach the glowing glory... I just wanted to tell you that. Talk to you later!
You are a great Trainer, with a good balance between intellect, power, and your heart. But above all, the power of your heart is what is special. What do you think of honestly trying to study how to be a Psychic once to see? I bet you could become a better Psychic than me if you tried...

Hello?! Oh, hey, sorry for shouting! I’m doing great! 
You know there’re some stronger Gym Leaders around. Don’t lose heart! Keep going!
Let’s see... I’m free most Wednesday nights. Give me a call then, OK?
Oh hey! I just finished training. Do you want to battle again? [VAR(512, 0)]
All right! I’ll be waiting over at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City!
Noooooo! That’s terrible!
Hmm... You’re just battling me, right? Don’t you have other plans?
I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. Look forward to it!
Yo! Chuck here! What’s up? 
Hey, didn’t we make plans to meet at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City? Don’t tell me you forgot? Come on, man! I’m waiting!
You know, I spend a lot of time training under a pounding waterfall every day. I guess that’s why I’ve been disagreeing with my wife a lot lately. I was thinking of taking her on a trip as an apology, but I can’t think of any good places to go. ...That’s it! I should take her to Tohjo Falls! What do you think?
You know, I’m just going to say this once, but I... I really like sweets. They’re the best. After training every day, the thing that I absolutely look forward to more than anything is sneaking behind my wife’s back to eat something sweet. Fortunately, I haven’t been packing on too many pounds... Oh! Don’t tell my wife! Please!
Lately my Gym’s waterfall device has been malfunction... Aaaaahh! Boomwhooshoowhooshoowhoosh oowhooshoowhooshoowhoosh oowhooshoowhooshoowhoosh...! ...Haa haaa haaaaa. Sorry. While I was on the phone with you, the device broke and I just got doused with water. I’ll call you back once things have calmed down a bit here!

Hello... What’s up? I’m doing great! 
Hmm... I’d like to battle you again, but I think there’re some Gyms that you haven’t visited yet, aren’t there?
I can take a break on Saturday evenings, if you want to give me a call again then.
Hey, you called at just the right time! I’m free right now. Want to battle me again? [VAR(512, 0)]
All right, all right! I’m looking forward to it! I’ll meet you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City! I won’t be at the Pewter Gym, all right? Don’t get confused!
Is that so... Well, I suppose you must have a lot of things to do yourself...
Yeah, I’d really like to battle with you again... But I think you’ve got an appointment with someone else? Once you’ve taken care of your obligations with other Trainers, then call me again!
I’ll be waiting for you to arrive at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. It’s a promise between Trainers!
This is Brock. Oh hey, how are you doing? 
We made plans to battle at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City, didn’t we? You didn’t forget, did you?
A large earthquake struck recently. Some of the walls in my Gym crumbled a bit. Well, I guess that’s just the kind of thing my Gym’s known for. So even if the walls crumbled a bit, nobody would really notice!
There are so many different types of Pokémon in the world. As you could guess, I like Rock-type Pokémon best. They’re solid and rough, and yet somewhat brittle at the same time. Once you’ve really gotten to know them, they’re even quite cute. What do you think?
Every town’s Pokémon Gym is different! The design, the tricks, everything is so different. It’s interesting! Each Gym Leader assigned to take care of a Gym by the Pokémon League gets to design as they please. Of course, Pewter Gym’s design is my pride and joy! The tricks aren’t much, but you can’t deny that when you enter, the design has a breathtaking impact, right?

Hello? How are you? I’m doing great as usual! 
There are so many stronger Gym Leaders than me out there. You’re trying to visit every Gym around the region, aren’t you? That’s great! Keep up the good work!
On Thursdays around noon, I’m usually free. If you want to see my Bug-type Pokémon again, you should call me then!
Oh, you called at just the right time! I’m not doing anything right now. Wanna battle again? [VAR(512, 0)]
All right! See you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City!
I see... Well, there’s no helping that...
Huh? It’s great that you want to battle, but don’t you have other plans? You should take care of those plans first, and then give me a call.
All right, I’ll be waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City! Race you there!
Yeah, this is Bugsy... What’s up? 
Hey, didn’t we make plans to meet at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City for a battle? Did you forget or something?
You know, everyone’s really into Bug-type Pokémon when they’re kids. But then for some reason, as people grow up, at some point they all start to like Bug-type Pokémon less and less. How about you? Do you still like Bug-type Pokémon? Even if I grow up I’ll never stop liking Bug-type Pokémon, no way!
My Gym has such a different trick to it, doesn’t it? It may seem like it was really difficult to get a trick like that set up... But the truth is, it was actually pretty easy. First we ran the ropes through the Gym, then all the Pokémon helped us finish everything else up!
I think I’ve already mentioned this to you, but did you know I’m doing research on Bug-type Pokémon? There’s so many different kinds, it’s a bit difficult, you know? I’m just studying Bug-type Pokémon, and yet it’s still this difficult. People like Professor Elm and Professor Oak who study all the different types of Pokémon are really something else, you know?

Hello... Oh, hi, how are you? I’m doing fine, thanks. 
You know, there are Gym Leaders out there who are stronger than me. You should try battling them. I don’t think you’d lose.
I usually get up pretty early... If we’re going to battle, I’m at my best in the morning... How about you give me a call on Monday morning!
Oh, perfect timing! I was starting to get bored... Do you want to battle again? [VAR(512, 0)]
Honesty is good. So, I’ll meet you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City, then?
I see. Well, that’s how it’s got to be... If you ever change your mind, give me a call. Remember, I’m free on Monday mornings.
Hmm. Do you really have the time to battle me right now? If you’ve got plans with other people, you should take care of those first, don’t you think?
All right, I will see you at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. I won’t be late. Don’t worry!
Yes, this is Pryce. How are you doing? 
We made plans to battle at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. You didn’t forget, did you? I’m waiting there for you.
Just like one of my children... No. You’re more like one of my grandchildren... There’s such an age difference between myself and the Trainers who defeat me nowadays... But you know, the strange thing is that when I lose, I don’t feel disappointed. I just feel happy. Just happy that such talented Trainers have come to see me. ...I just wanted to talk to someone about that, so I called you. That’s all.
Do you know why they call me the winter Trainer? Do you recall that my middle name is “Willow”? The willow tree looks like it withers in winter’s cold. But really, it sprouts dozens of new buds. My fighting style is also strong just like that... It’s written in old books, you know. You should look it up sometime.
That reminds me, you kept Team Rocket’s treachery in check, right? Humph... That’s a praiseworthy deed and an appropriate responsibility for a Trainer who could defeat me. I think there’s still several things I could stand to learn from you. I’m looking forward to it.

Whenever MARILL gets annoyed, it hops in the water. Recently it jumped into the bath, and there was water all over the place! Well, I’ll talk to you more about Pokémon later!

I took a BULBASAUR for a walk on Route 1 the other day! It really seemed like it was enjoying it!
You know, I wonder what it’d be like taking a CHARMANDER for a stroll along Route 2... I heard that CHARMANDER really like that area.
You know, I’ve heard that people who take a SQUIRTLE for a walk on Route 3 tend to fall down!
Speaking of... Mt. Moon is on Route 4, isn’t it? If I recall correctly, CLEFAIRY really like Mt. Moon!
You know there’s a Fighting Dojo in Saffron City? The Pokémon I had with me were all really surprised!
You know, I went to the port in Vermilion City. All of my Pokémon had so much fun riding on the S.S. Aqua!
You know, I took a PORYGON for a walk in Celadon City...and I heard this weird, “Jijiji...” sound. It was like it was trying to speak!
You know how there’s a guy named Mr. Psychic in Saffron City? I wonder what would happen if you took Psychic-type Pokémon there?
Hey, have you been to the Rock Tunnel yet? If you take an ONIX with you there, it becomes so happy!
Hey, you know if you ever get the chance to go to the Power Plant, you should take a PIKACHU with you. It’s really fun!
Hey, you know that DIGLETT’s Cave near Route 11? Speaking of the Pokémon that you should take with you there... Well, I probably don’t need to tell you!
Where are you right now? Route 12? I see... Oh! You should visit the Pokémon House in Lavender Town!
Where are you now? Route 13? Isn’t that where the road becomes a bit of a maze? That might be why the Pokémon in that area always seem a bit perplexed.
So, you’re around Route 14 right now, aren’t you? There’s a huge windmill over in that area, so it’s very beautiful, isn’t it?
Where are you now? Route 15? How about stopping by the Warden of the Pal Park’s house in Fuchsia? There’re so many AIPOM there. It’s fun!
You’re at Route 16 right now? So, you’re pretty close to Cycling Road then, aren’t you? It’s so much fun running with your Pokémon...but of course that’d be a little dangerous there!
You’re at Route 17 right now? So that means... you’re on the Cycling Road! It’s so much fun running with your Pokémon...but of course, that’d be a little dangerous there!
You’re at Route 18 right now? So, you’re pretty close to Cycling Road then, aren’t you? It’s so much fun running with your Pokémon...but of course, that’d be a little dangerous there!
You know, whenever I get over by Route 19, I always want to go play in the water with my Pokémon, don’t you? I think it’d be so much fun...
Come to think of it...when you’re near water with Fire-type Pokémon, they seem to really not enjoy it... I understand how they feel!
Sitting on Route 21 with your Pokémon, watching the sunset over the beach... What do you think about that? It seems weird to me, ’cause that’s more of a romantic couple thing to do!
You know, Route 22 is the road to the Pokémon League, so I bet it makes your Pokémon feel pretty nervous, huh?
You know, the bridge on Route 24 is called the “Nugget Bridge.” It’s not an official name, but it seems like a lot of people call it that. The sun’s light reflects off the water there, so it’s kind of dazzling...
You know, I think most Pokémon have never seen their own face. So if you take them to a puddle on Route 25 and let them see their reflection, I wonder what they’ll think...
You know, Route 26 is so full of natural beauty, I bet it’s a really wonderful place for Pokémon. But it’s also a road leading to the Pokémon League, so it probably makes them anxious, too.
You know, I’ve heard that sometimes Pokémon will find things along Route 27. It’s probably a good idea to take along the Pokémon you have the closest friendship with.
Route 28, that’s the one going to Mt. Silver, isn’t it? I’m sure that must make your Pokémon worry a little bit, too.
Oh, that’s right. How is it to take CHIKORITA with you to Route 29? I bet it will look like it’s having great fun!
Oh, that’s right. How is it to take TOTODILE with you to Route 30? I bet it will look like it’s having great fun!
You know, I bet it would be really interesting to take CYNDAQUIL with you to Route 31! I heard that CYNDAQUIL really like that area!
Hey, you can find UNOWN in the Ruins of Alph, right? I wonder what would happen if you already had one and took it for a walk through the ruins?
You know, it’s always raining on Route 33. It never stops! I get kind of down on rainy days, but I know there’s Pokémon out there that love the rain! ...Like TOTODILE!
You know, FARFETCH’D are known to have a strange fascination with Ilex Forest. When they’re there, it’s like they don’t even hear you. I think I might take a FARFETCH’D there to see for myself sometime.
Hey, did you know? When Pokémon go to the Pokéathlon, they get really excited and fired up! I think I’ll take my Pokémon over there soon, too!
Did you know that something really interesting happens if you take a SUDOWOODO to Route 36? What kind of interesting? Well, you’ll just have to try it and see!
Hey, did you meet the twins over on Route 37? They’re so cute, and their Pokémon are very popular.
I took a TAUROS over to Moomoo Farm recently. There was such an uproar, I didn’t know what to do!
You know, you should take a MILTANK with you over to Route 39. It will find so many friends over there. It’ll be great fun!
You should take a POLIWAG over to Route 40 sometime and see what happens! You’ll see something interesting. That’s for sure!
You know, Water-type Pokémon really love the sea... Watching your Pokémon having fun and being really happy is enough to make you feel happy, too!
Is everything all right? You know, Route 42 is a mountain road. If you take a Rock-type Pokémon through there, I bet they’d enjoy it.
You know, if you’d like to see MAGIKARP get really excited, you should take it over to the Lake of Rage and see what happens!
Right now you’re...on Route 44! Was I right? All right! It’s pretty cold around there, right? I feel bad for the Pokémon that are sensitive to cold... But I bet Ice-type Pokémon feel right at home!
You know, there’s that river that meanders around near Route 45. It’s a fun route to take. I went there recently, and my Pokémon were really interested in the river. They kept looking out at it.
Hey, you know how there’s so much tall grass on Route 46? Well, the Pokémon you have with you also become worried about when a wild Pokémon will come leaping out!
You know, Route 47 has such a beautiful, natural view! ...That said, have you heard of DITTO? DITTO get really energetic around Route 47. It’s kind of strange...
Hey... You know how there’s that really tall cliff near Route 48? When you’re walking around there, the Pokémon with you all get pretty scared, too... Me? Me, I’m...always shaking with fear!
Where are you now? Pallet Town... That means you’re over by Professor Oak’s place! The professor really likes Pokémon. You should take a Pokémon over to Professor Oak’s Laboratory sometime!
Where are you now? Viridian City? That’s where the Trainer House is, right? When Pokémon go over there, they get really fired up, you know!
So, where are you now? Viridian City? Oh, you’re in Pewter City! In Pewter there’s a museum, right? You can take Pokémon over to the museum with you for a fun field trip!
So, where are you now? Cerulean City, you say? So...did you meet the Cerulean Gym Leader, Misty? Oh, nothing. Just wondering.
Where are you now? Lavender Town? You’ve gone pretty far, huh? In that town, there’s a place called the House of Memories where they have Pokémon graves, you know. As a Trainer, you should visit at least once out of respect.
Where are you now? Vermilion City? That’s where the Pokémon Fan Club is if I recall correctly! If you’ve got a BAYLEEF, you should take it over there to them and say hi!
So, where are you now? Celadon City? I see... That reminds me. I once took a TANGELA with me to Celadon. It was so happy... and something happened! You should try it, too, and see what happens!
So, where are you now? Fuchsia City? You just pop up in the strangest places, don’t you? That reminds me. I heard that if you take a TAUROS to Fuchsia, they get really agitated! I wonder why... I don’t really get it. But I bet it would be interesting to try it and see what happens!

Route 22 is the road to the Pokémon League, isn’t it? I bet it makes your Pokémon feel pretty nervous, huh?
You know, there’s a really big bridge on Route 24 called the “Nugget Bridge.” It’s not an official name, but it seems like a lot of people call it that. The sun’s light reflects off the water there, so it’s kind of dazzling...
Hey, you know how there’s that big puddle on Route 25? I think most Pokémon have never seen their own face. I wonder what they would think if they saw their reflection in that puddle...
You know, Route 26 is so full of natural beauty. I bet that it’s a really wonderful place for Pokémon. But it’s also a road leading to the Pokémon League, so it probably makes them nervous, too.
You know, I’ve heard that sometimes Pokémon will find things along Route 27. It’s probably a good idea to take along the Pokémon you have the closest friendship with.
Route 28, that’s the one going to Mt. Silver, right? Your Pokémon probably put on a good show of being brave, but I bet they worry a little bit, too...
What do you think about taking CHIKORITA with you to Route 29? I bet it will look like it’s having great fun!
What do you think about taking TOTODILE with you to Route 30? I bet it will look like it’s having great fun!
What do you think about taking CYNDAQUIL with you to Route 31? I bet it will look like it’s having great fun!
I heard from someone that you can find a Pokémon called UNOWN in the Ruins of Alph. So, if that’s true...I wonder if that would change if you already had an UNOWN and you took them with you to the Ruins of Alph...
You know, it’s always raining on Route 33. It never stops! I get kind of down on rainy days, but I know there’s Pokémon out there that love the rain! ...Like TOTODILE!
You know, FARFETCH’D are known to have a strange fascination with Ilex Forest. When they’re there, it’s like they don’t even hear you. I think I might take a FARFETCH’D there to see for myself sometime.
Hey, have you heard of the Pokéathlon? When Pokémon go to the Pokéathlon, they get so excited! I think I’ll take my Pokémon there sometime, too!
Did you know that something really interesting happens if you take a SUDOWOODO to Route 36? What kind of interesting? Well, you’ll just have to try it and see!
Hey, did you meet the twins over on Route 37? They’re so cute, and their Pokémon are very popular.
I took a TAUROS over to Moomoo Farm on Route 39 recently. There was such an uproar, I didn’t know what to do!
You know, if you’re going over to Route 39, you should take a MILTANK along with you. It will find so many friends over there, it’ll be great fun!
You know, if you’re headed over to Route 40, you should take a POLIWAG with you and see what happens! You’ll see something interesting. That’s for sure!
I recently went over to Route 41 to have fun. You know, Water-type Pokémon really love the sea... Watching your Pokémon have fun and be happy is enough to make you happy, too!
You know, Route 42 is a mountain road. If you take a Rock-type Pokémon through there, I bet they’d enjoy it.
You know, if you’d like to see MAGIKARP get really excited, you should take it over to the Lake of Rage and see what happens!
Speaking of Route 44, it’s such a cold place. I feel bad for the Pokémon that are sensitive to cold... But I bet that Ice-type Pokémon feel right at home!
You know, there’s that river that meanders around near Route 45. It’s a fun route to take. I went there recently, and my Pokémon were really interested in the river. They kept looking out at it.
Hey, you know how there’s so much tall grass on Route 46? Well, the Pokémon you have with you also become worried about when a wild Pokémon will come leaping out!
Have you been to Route 47? It has such a beautiful, natural view! ...That said, have you heard of DITTO? DITTO get really energetic around Route 47. It’s kind of strange...
You know how there’s that really tall cliff near Route 47? When you’re walking around there, the Pokémon with you all get pretty scared, too... Me? I’m perfectly fine with heights!
Pallet Town’s Professor Oak really likes Pokémon. You should take a Pokémon over to Professor Oak’s Laboratory sometime!
There’s a Trainer House in Viridian City. Did you know? When Pokémon go over there, they get really fired up, you know!
In Pewter City there’s a museum, right? You can take Pokémon over to the museum with you for a fun field trip!
So...did you meet the Cerulean City Gym Leader, Misty...? Oh, it’s nothing! I was just wondering!
In Lavender Town, there’s a place called the House of Memories where they have Pokémon graves, you know. As a Trainer, you should visit at least once out of respect.
Vermilion City’s where the Pokémon Fan Club is if I recall correctly! If you’ve got a BAYLEEF, you should take it over there to them and say hi!
You know, I once took a TANGELA with me to Celadon City Gym. It was so happy, and something happened! You should try it, too, and see what happens! 
You know, I heard that if you take a TAUROS to Fuchsia, they get really agitated! I wonder why... I don’t really get it. But I bet it would be interesting to try it and see what happens!
If you’re in Cinnabar with your Pokémon, looking out to sea while standing in a town that was buried in lava... That seems almost like the final scene from a movie or something!
You know, the Indigo Plateau is pretty close to the Pokémon League. Your Pokémon will likely yell out to psych themselves up!
Saffron City is where the Copycat’s house is, right? You should take a MIME JR. over there and see what happens. I bet it’s something interesting!
If you go back home to New Bark Town, you should show off your Pokémon to your mom. I bet she’d be happy!
I really like that wonderful winding path in Cherrygrove City. It’s so much fun to run with your Pokémon along the beach and listen to the sound of the waves!
If you’re in Violet City, that means you’re near Sprout Tower! You should take a BELLSPROUT with you when you go there! I heard they dance! I wonder if it’s true... Will you try it and find out for me?
Azalea Town’s Gym is really awesome, don’t you think? Did you try riding the SPINARAK yet? I wonder what would happen if you took a real SPINARAK to that Gym? I think it’d be interesting!
If you’re going to Cianwood, you should try taking a KRABBY with you. What’s it like? Well, you should try it and see for yourself!
You know, if you look carefully at the Goldenrod City Gym, it’s in the shape of a CLEFAIRY? It’s true! You should take a CLEFAIRY there! I bet that whatever happens, it will be incredibly cute!
When you mention Olivine City, all I think of is the Port Lighthouse! You should take an AMPHAROS there and see what happens! I bet it will be bright...
If you have a PICHU, you should take it with you over to the Ecruteak Dance Theater! It’s such a wonderful place. Whenever I’m there, I feel like dancing!
That reminds me...have you caught any Ice-type Pokémon yet? Ice-type Pokémon really love playing on the ice. They look like they’re having so much fun!
You know, if you go to the Lake of Rage, you can see just how energetic MAGIKARP can be!
There’s someone in Blackthorn City who can make Pokémon forget moves they’ve learned. But if you do that, they don’t just forget their moves, they forget they were holding an item, too. Well, that sounds pretty unlikely, so you shouldn’t worry about it!
Have you heard of a place called Mt. Silver? I haven’t been there yet. I bet it’s a place that makes even Pokémon pretty nervous.
Did you know that there’s a huge Bug-Catching Contest in the National Park? That’s why there’re so many Bug-type Pokémon there. If you took your Bug-type Pokémon there too, I bet they’d really enjoy it!
I heard from someone that you can find a Pokémon called UNOWN in the Ruins of Alph. So, if that’s true...I wonder if that would change if you already had an UNOWN and you took it with you to the Ruins of Alph...
It’s a bit far to walk to get to the Safari Zone, but it’s definitely worth it. There’re so many different Pokémon there!

Bill
Hello, is this [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? That reminds me... Telephones, they change your voice into electricity to carry it over a long distance, don’t they? So, if you consider that technology, you could change Pokémon into electricity and send them over large distances as well, no? So, based on that theory, I was able to come up with and create the Pokémon Storage system! Well, it’s not quite as simple as a telephone, but you get the idea, right?

Who’s calling? [VAR(259, 0, 0)], is it? Hang on a sec... ... ... 
Well, you’re starting on the PC Box named [VAR(267, 10, 0)] right now. That’s an easy-to-remember name.  Easy to remember is the best way to go. OK, including the space left in [VAR(267, 10, 0)], you can still hold [VAR(308, 11, 0)] more Pokémon in the PC.

Call again sometime...
Your PC Boxes are full! You’ll have to release some Pokémon if you want to catch more. 
Hey, this is Bill here. You know your PC Boxes are full, right? You’ve done a great job of catching Pokémon, haven’t you! Seriously, it’s wonderful, I tip my hat! That said, you do understand that with your PC Boxes full like that, you can’t catch any more Pokémon? Just so you know.

Prof. Oak
Hello, this is Professor Oak... Hmm... It’s strange. I know your voice, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], but somehow hearing it over the phone makes you sound so different.
Hello, this is Professor Oak... Hmm... It’s strange. I know your voice, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], but somehow hearing it over the phone makes you sound so different.
Hello, this is Professor Oak! You’re catching a lot of Pokémon, aren’t you?
Hello, this is Professor Oak! Your Pokédex is really filling up!
Hello, this is Professor Oak! You’re moving along at an incredible pace! You remind me of myself when I was younger!
Hello, this is Professor Oak! If you start to get tired, you should take a break. Don’t push yourself too hard!
This is Professor Oak... When I’m recording my radio show, I have to travel back and forth between Kanto and Johto. It gets a bit tiring... Oh, but never mind that! You’re doing a great job on filling your Pokédex!
Hello, this is Professor Oak! It looks like you’ve found some Pokémon that aren’t from the Johto or the Kanto regions, haven’t you? You’re a strong Trainer, and you’re really making some discoveries!
...This is Professor Oak. I’ve been so busy with my research that I haven’t gotten much sleep lately... Oh, but never mind that! You’ve made such good progress on your Pokédex. I can’t wait to see it!
Hello, this is Professor Oak! Have you noticed that your circle of friends has gotten bigger since you started working on the Pokédex? That’s the best thing about Pokémon!
Hello, this is Professor Oak! You know, I don’t see many wonderful Trainers such as yourself very often lately! I’ll have to thank Professor Elm for introducing us!
Hello, this is Professor Oak! Oh, you don’t have to say anything! I know better than anyone else how hard you’re working! I thought I should get you a present or something in appreciation... Well, I picked something up, but I completely forgot to give it to you! Ha ha ha! Oh, you don’t have to wonder about it at all. I know it’s something that will be very helpful to you. You should just come here and pick it up! I’ll be waiting for you at my Laboratory in Pallet Town! 
Hello, this is Professor Oak... Oh, hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! 
Hello, this is Professor Oak... Oh, hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! 
So, how’s your Pokédex coming along?
Quit
Have Pokédex Evaluated
Have Johto Pokédex Evaluated
Have National Pokédex Evaluated
Hmm, let’s see... You’ve seen [VAR(308, 5, 0)] Pokémon, and you’ve caught [VAR(308, 6, 0)] Pokémon! I see! 
Show me your Pokédex again anytime!
Wow! That is a complete Johto Pokédex! Thanks to you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], the Johto Pokédex is complete! Wow... You’ve done an incredible job!
Wow! That is a complete Johto Pokédex! Thanks to you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)], the Johto Pokédex is complete! Wow... You’ve done an incredible job!
Excellent! That is an amazing National Pokédex! Wow... You’ve lived up to my expectations wonderfully! No, you’ve exceeded them, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. You’ve become an amazing Trainer! Thank you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]!
Excellent! That is an amazing National Pokédex! Wow... You’ve lived up to my expectations wonderfully! No, you’ve exceeded them, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. You’ve become an amazing Trainer! Thank you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]!
Really, you’ve surprised me! But just as I expected, you’ve completed the Johto Pokédex. I am so grateful! If you’ve got that much determination, then even more exciting adventures await you in the world of Pokémon!
You have truly surprised me! You’ve more than exceeded my expectations. You’ve gone far past them in completing the National Pokédex! I’m speechless...! Because of this, the world of Pokémon and Trainers is more vast, deeper, and more abundant! Now there will be no end to Pokémon research!
Look for Pokémon in grassy areas! 
Good. I see you understand how to use Poké Balls. 
You’re getting good at this, but you have a long way to go. 
Hmm, you’re catching Pokémon at a decent pace! 
You’re trying--I can see that. Your Pokédex is coming together. 
You’re training them well. You know some Pokémon don’t evolve just by battling with others, right? 
Do you have a Fishing Rod? There are some Pokémon that can only be found by fishing! 
Excellent! You seem to be good at collecting things! 
Some Pokémon only appear during certain times of the day. 
Your Pokédex is really filling up. Keep up the good work! 
I’m impressed. You’re evolving Pokémon, not just catching them. 
If you can learn how to use the custom Poké Balls made by Kurt effectively, you’ll be able to catch Pokémon better! 
When you trade Pokémon, you can also trade information. Your friends can really help you! 
Are you trading your Pokémon? It’s tough to do this alone! 
Wow! You’ve reached 200! Your Pokédex is looking great! 
You’ve found so many Pokémon! You’ve really helped my studies! 
Magnificent! You have the ability to become a great Pokémon Professor someday! 
Your Pokédex is amazing! You’re ready to turn professional! 
The goal may be far away, but don’t give up yet! Keep going! 
Don’t forget, some Pokémon only appear at certain times of the day! 
If you break rocks, some Pokémon that were hiding there might come jumping out! 
That’s wonderful you’ve been able to gather this many Pokémon! The path ahead is long. Keep up the great work! 
If you Headbutt a tree, sometimes a Pokémon might fall out! 
A lot of Pokémon not found in the Johto region like to congregate at the Safari Zone. 
Music on the radio might also entice Pokémon to leap out! 
Wow, you’ve gotten so far...! I’m actually a little surprised! 
This is a critical moment! You can’t become discouraged! 
Just a little more! I’ve got high expectations for you! 
I have never before in all my years seen such an incredible Trainer! 
So, how’s your Pokédex coming along? [VAR(512, 0)]

This has to be the first time I’ve done something like this from so close! I mean talking on the phone!
Oh hi, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! This is Warden Baoba. Sorry to have kept you waiting! We’ve finally opened the Safari Zone! Do you know where it is? You know the Gate inside the cavern in Cianwood City?

Hi! You like CLEFAIRY, too? They’re so very cute, aren’t they? I think we can be good friends! I want to know your phone number! Let’s talk about CLEFAIRY! [VAR(512, 0)]
Isn’t my CLEFAIRY super adorable?
Aww... Oh well. Look for me if you want to talk about CLEFAIRY.
Won’t you give me your number? Let’s talk about CLEFAIRY! [VAR(512, 0)]
Oh, there you are! I’ll give this to you then. It’s a CLEFAIRY Poké Doll! 
Um... Well... Is it that difficult to talk to me? I mean, by phone is all right, but if we’re this close, you don’t have to stay away. You can just come talk to me.
[VAR(270, 4, 0)]! It’s awful. My CLEFAIRY... Huh? This is [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? Oh, sorry! I was in a hurry, and I... I have to go! Bye-bye!

My [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s adorable, don’t you think so? I always sleep next to it--it’s so fluffy and warm! Oh, and we had to battle a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] a while ago... My CLEFAIRY came close to fainting! Isn’t that awful? I hate those nasty [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! Bye-bye!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s adorable, don’t you think so? I always sleep next to it--it’s so fluffy and warm! Oh, and we had to battle a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] a while ago... My CLEFAIRY got frightened, so we ran away as fast as we could! I just can’t help feeling protective of my CLEFAIRY. Bye-bye!
I know this might surprise you, but would you like to battle? I’ll be waiting with CLEFAIRY on [VAR(260, 3, 0)].
What’s wrong? Can’t you visit? CLEFAIRY got tired and fell asleep. I’m not sure if I can wake it up... Please hurry to [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
I love dressing up my CLEFAIRY!
While I was at the Goldenrod Dept. Store recently, I found these super-cute Poké Dolls! I’ll give you one! Come collect it on [VAR(260, 3, 0)].
What’s wrong? Can’t you visit? This Poké Doll is so cute, too! Please hurry to [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!

Well, now that we’ve made each other’s acquaintance, shall we trade phone numbers? [VAR(512, 0)]
Lovely! Now I shall be able to call you anytime.
I see... As to be expected, children prefer to spend time with others their own age...
You don’t really want to trade phone numbers with me, do you? [VAR(512, 0)]
What’s wrong? Aren’t we on the same floor right now? Why not talk in person?
I was so surprised! A few days ago, I received a NOCTOWL when I traded with someone. It turns out that NOCTOWL was the same one I gave away in a trade with another Trainer years ago! I guess that’s a case of “What goes around, comes around,” in that it came back to me. The world is small after all!
It’s kind of disappointing. A few days ago, I received a NOCTOWL when I traded with someone. It was such a familiar NOCTOWL... I thought it was the NOCTOWL that I had originally trained! It’d somehow found its way back... I was so moved... But when I looked closer, I saw that it wasn’t the NOCTOWL I thought it was. That kind of thing can’t really happen in this world, right?
You know, whenever I try to catch a wild Pokémon, they seem to always run away. It’s happened so many times. A couple days ago a RATTATA got away from me... You know, whenever I meet a person or Pokémon, I always make sure to take off my hat and introduce myself properly, and that’s when they run away. RATTATA are such impolite creatures...
Ha ha, would you like to battle again? I think that’s a fine idea! I’ll meet you at [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
Is everything all right? Did you forget about our appointment? I’m waiting at [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. I will see you there!
Just like this, when calling a young person such as yourself, you can trade information. Just like this, Pokémon bring people together, don’t they? Truly, Pokémon are such extraordinary creatures.

Tweet! Tweeeeeet! If my FARFETCH’D sees anything pretty, it goes and gets it. Do you like pretty things? I could share if it gets some more. How about we trade phone numbers? I’ll call if it finds anything. [VAR(512, 0)]
I’ll call you as soon as I get something pretty.
You sure? Well, tell me if you change your mind.
Tweet! Tweeeeeet! Do you like pretty things? I could share if FARFETCH’D goes and gets more. Will you give me your phone number? [VAR(512, 0)]

Tweet! Tweeeeeet! ...Huh? Wait, don’t tell me that you’re calling from nearby? Well, why not come a little closer and talk in person!
Hey listen, my [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s stalk has this really delicious aroma. That aroma gets my appetite going! Be seeing you!
A while ago, my FARFETCH’D knocked out this [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. You should have seen FARFETCH’D wield that stalk. Amazing stuff! Be seeing you!
I ran into a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]... I was trying to catch it, but it took off faster than I thought it would. It was a bit disappointing. Be seeing you!
Want to battle again? For some reason, my FARFETCH’D is all worked up and raring to go. [VAR(260, 3, 0)] is where I’m at. Keep an eye out for me, OK?
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], could you hurry over? FARFETCH’D is agitated. If you don’t come soon, it might smack me with its stalk! [VAR(260, 3, 0)]! Please come as soon as you can!

I haven’t gotten what I promised you yet. I’ll call you as soon as I get it, so could you wait a little longer?
My FARFETCH’D had something pretty in its beak. Like I promised, you can have it. Catch up to me on [VAR(260, 3, 0)], and I’ll let you have it.

I’ll remember to call when I want to battle again!
Oh... I’m sad... If you do want to battle, come see Erin--that’s me!
I want to battle with you again. Do you want to exchange numbers? [VAR(512, 0)]
Aww... I lost again! I wonder how many times that is... Thanks for coming! Here’s a present! 
What’s up? Wait, are you seriously calling me from that close by? Are you scared of me or something? Why not talk face-to-face?
Erin’s [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is much stronger than before! I should know--I’m Erin! See you. Bye-bye!
And, and... I just battled and we defeated a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! I’ve raised my Pokémon properly! See you. Bye-bye!
But, but... A wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] got away from me again. It’s just not fair! See you. Bye-bye!
I’m Erin. Want to battle me again? I’ll be waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!

That’s too bad...
Hey! You really want to trade phone numbers with me, don’t you? [VAR(512, 0)]
Huh? I can hear the sound of a windmill... That must mean that you’re nearby, aren’t you? So come have a proper conversation!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] works really hard! Everything I learn at school, it helps me repeat it right away. Do your Pokémon listen to what you say?
Yesterday we battled a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! We practiced all the stuff I learned in school! Where do you go to school? Seriously, you don’t go to my school? That can’t be true, can it?
Recently I was trying to catch a [VAR(256, 11, 0)], but it ran away! So disappointing! And so I don’t forget how disappointing it was, I’m writing down the name of the Pokémon that got away on my notebook. There’re Pokémon names all over my notebook!
Hey, come battle me again. I’ll be waiting at [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
Hello? I’m at [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. We were going to battle, weren’t we? Hurry on over!
Huh? The only time you ever see me is when I’m on my way home from school? I suppose you’re right... But when I’m on my way to school, I’m always in a rush so that I’m not late. I don’t have any time for Pokémon battles then!

Looks like you’re a wimp...
Hey, give me your phone number. You’d be fun to battle, so I’ll call you when I get stronger! [VAR(512, 0)]
Man! You’re as tough as ever! I’ve battled you over and over, but [VAR(259, 0, 0)], I haven’t won once. I bought tons of items to toughen up my Pokémon, but to no avail... Items alone aren’t the answer. That must be what it is... Here, take this, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]. I won’t be needing it anymore... 
Wow, when you call from inside the Lighthouse, your voice just kind of echoes. It’s kind of cool!
How are your Pokémon doing? My Pokémon are a bit too energetic. [VAR(256, 10, 0)], especially. Every time it spots a Trainer, it just charges ahead into battle! It gets to be a bit much for me! Later!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s looking tougher than ever. It looks even tougher than me! Later!
Hey, I challenge you to a battle! It won’t be like last time! [VAR(260, 3, 0)]’s where I’m waiting for you. Hustle over here pronto!
Hey, you’d better not have forgotten about our battle! [VAR(260, 3, 0)]! Hustle over quick! I’m waiting!

And yet another loss... No doubt about it--you’re tough. Being beaten this often actually feels good now! Here, take this. Use it to get even tougher. That will toughen me up, too!

Hey, do you remember my super-cool [VAR(256, 10, 0)]? My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is different from regular [VAR(256, 10, 0)]. It’s like my [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is in the top percentage of [VAR(256, 10, 0)]. Do you know what I’m saying?
Oh yeah, I took down a [VAR(256, 11, 0)] in the wild the other day. It was a cakewalk. Well, I guess it can’t be helped, us being so tough. All right. Later!
Oh yeah, I saw a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! I thought about going for it, but then I failed! Oh well. I guess that’s just the way it goes. I’m not very good at catching Pokémon...

Shhh!!! The POLIWHIRL will run away! Don’t bother calling me, come talk to me in person, that way we can whisper!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s grown impressive! My fishing skills have improved, too! We beat a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]... You know, I have more fun fishing than beating wild Pokémon. All right, later.
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s grown impressive! My fishing skills have improved, too! But some time ago, we came this close to landing a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. I tell you, it was huge. Believe me. All right, later.

Hey! What’re you, nervous?
Oh, I see you’ve finally figured out just how amazing I am? Well, that’s to be expected. Let’s trade phone numbers! [VAR(512, 0)]
Well, I probably look a lot scarier than I really am. Would you believe I’m really a nice guy? I won’t bite, so come and talk to me in person!
Yo, Teddy! You do a pretty good impression of a motorcycle! Next time you get a chance, you and I should go riding and yell like motorcycles. What do you say? ......Wait, who is this? Oh no! Wrong number! Sorry!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] does a great job! Anyway, its fighting spirit is different. It’s never lost to any but the strongest Pokémon! What about your Pokémon? Do they have any fighting spirit? Never mind, you don’t have to answer. I should know better than anyone just how strong your Pokémon are!
We’re a Biker gang, you know. Got Pokémon with poison, with spikes all over their bodies, with fangs, and we even have some Ghost-type Pokémon. It’s all a big show of how tough we are. But... As for me... I really like cute Pokémon like MARILL!
So, yesterday I thought I was gonna catch a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. But that [VAR(256, 11, 0)], it took one look at me and ran off! It was totally rude! You wouldn’t run away if you saw me, would you...?
Yo! So, I really wanna battle you again. I mean, I am really itching to show off! I’m always hanging out on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Don’t get all nervous and run away, got it?!
What’s going on with you? I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]! You wouldn’t forget a promise you made with a buddy, would you?

Well, since we’re on the phone, how about we give you a quiz? ... So, who’s speaking right now? Kay or Tia? ... ... ... ... The correct answer is... Eleanor from the Pokémon Fan club, who’s standing next to the twins!
Hey, Tia found an Oval Stone. We’ll give it to you if you come find us on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Got it?
We’re waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. We’ll give you an Oval Stone...

I’ll telephone you if I hear anything interesting.
Aww... You won’t be my friend?
Let’s be friends! Can I have your phone number? I want to hear about everything you’ve seen! [VAR(512, 0)]
If you’re nearby, just come talk in person!
Oh, you have to hear this. My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is so adorable! It always wants to nuzzle me! And, and! Um... We beat a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] with just one hit a little while ago. We felt sorry for it, though. OK, I’ll call you later!
Oh, you have to hear this. My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is so adorable! It’s always giving me cute looks! And, and! Uh... We just saw a really gorgeous [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. But I was on the phone, so it got away. It made us really angry! OK, I’ll call you later!
Listen, listen! I was listening to the radio in the Ruins of Alph when an odd broadcast suddenly cut in on the regular show. I wonder what it was. So strange! OK, I’ll call you later!
Listen, listen! Don’t you think Falkner of Violet Gym is cool and handsome? But they say his dad, who’s out training on the road, is even more cool and handsome than Falkner. I wish I could meet him! OK, I’ll call you later!
Listen, listen! Do you know Earl, the teacher who runs the Pokémon School in Violet? I saw him doing pirouettes while he was running. It was wildly funny! OK, I’ll call you later!

Listen, listen! Do you know about Moomoo Milk? You can buy it at Moomoo Farm. It’s supposed to be good for health and beauty. I really want to try some. I bet it’s delicious! OK, I’ll call you later!
Listen, listen! There’s a Pokémon Salon in Goldenrod that’s run by two brothers. The older brother is good, but the younger one really isn’t. But the younger one charges less, and sometimes does a better job than his brother. Every time I go, I have a hard time trying to decide whom I should use... OK, I’ll call you later!
Listen, listen! Goldenrod Gym’s Whitney began battling only a little while ago! But the Pokémon League chose her as a Gym Leader! I bet she must be totally talented. OK, I’ll call you later!
Listen, listen! Have you ever taken part in a Bug-Catching Contest at the National Park? I did once, but all I could catch was a CATERPIE. But guess what! I won with that CATERPIE. Isn’t that great? OK, I’ll call you later!

Oh, here you are! I’ll give you this Berry that my Pokémon found. Here you go! 
I have to say it’s kind of strange to be talking on the phone when you’re standing nearby.

Hey! Psst! Listen! This [VAR(256, 11, 0)] I ran into earlier just up and ran away! I was so disappointed! I really wanted to catch it, too!
Did you catch any [VAR(256, 11, 0)] yet? You can always find them around here.

Ulp! Are you saying you think I’m so weak, I don’t measure up as an opponent?
I’d do anything to get your phone number! Please, let’s trade numbers! [VAR(512, 0)]
Oh yeah. This is a Shiny Stone. It’s all right, don’t be shy! You can have it. Go ahead! 
Huh? There’s something odd about your voice... Don’t tell me... You’re standing nearby, aren’t you? If you’ve already gotten this close, why not come talk in person?
I’m still a featherweight, as usual... My constant companion, [VAR(256, 10, 0)], is training hard! It even knocked out a [VAR(256, 11, 0)] in under two seconds in a recent battle! OK, OK, two seconds is a bit of an exaggeration... It was actually five minutes and 37 seconds...
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] has gotten pretty strong! Well, it’s gotten strong, but this [VAR(256, 11, 0)] it was battling ran away before the fight was over... That was [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s fault, right? It was my fault? I guess that’s a possibility!
Earlier, I was contemplating something while walking... Suddenly this [VAR(256, 11, 0)] jumped out! I was pretty surprised, and then it ran away! I was thinking about it, and I had made plans to trade with a friend, so I was looking for a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]... It’s too bad...
Where are you now? I’m always on [VAR(260, 3, 0)] myself. What do you think about battling with me again? Sounds like a good idea? I’ll be waiting!
I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Don’t forget!
Ah... Ah... Achoo! Ah... Ah... Ah... Achoo! Oh, it’s nothing. It’s just that my bird Pokémon suddenly started flapping its wings...so there’s dust and stuff from their wings floating around my face... Ah... Ah... Now my nose is itchy... Achoooo!
My Pokémon was holding something in its mouth recently. I was thinking “What in the world?” and I pulled it out... It was a Shiny Stone! I was surprised. Wouldn’t you be? ...But what’s a Shiny Stone? I don’t really have any use for it, and I don’t know what it’s worth...so I’ll just give it to you! I’ll wait for you on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Come get it!

Whitney likes to relax on the sixth floor of the Goldenrod Department Store.
Janine delivers dinner to her father every evening. You can always find her at the Pokémon League Reception Gate in the late afternoon!
Falkner likes to come to Celadon City on Mondays, it seems.
It seems like Misty really likes Route 25! Every night she goes there to watch the sunset!
Sabrina likes to visit the port in Olivine on Friday nights. She really shows up in the strangest places, doesn’t she!
Maybe I should only tell you this... The truth is that Jasmine is a bit of a big eater! If you go to the Olivine Café past noon, you’re sure to run into Jasmine there!
Cinnabar Gym’s leader Blaine really thinks a lot about the town of Cinnabar, you know? Every Tuesday morning he sits on the site where the Cinnabar Gym once was and contemplates.
Pewter Gym’s Leader Brock really loves rocks! He goes into DIGLETT’s Cave every day past noon.
Bugsy goes looking for Bug-type Pokémon. He even goes looking as far as the Viridian Forest in the Kanto region!
Pryce is certainly a man of refined tastes, don’t you agree? Every morning at seven he goes out by himself and gazes out at the Lake of Rage.
Morty’s always looking at the Bell Tower, isn’t he? He’s just been engrossed by that one thing. To the point that he became a Gym Leader.
I really need to work on my training. Let’s battle again, OK? I’ll be waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!

Professor Oak’s dream is to compile a comprehensive Pokédex. I envy you for taking part in that project... See you later!
Do you know Kurt, the Poké Ball creator? He and Professor Oak go back a long way. I guess great people attract one another! See you later!
The Pokémon League is the great gathering place for all Trainers who wish to become the Champion. Professor Oak acts as an advisor to the Pokémon League’s headquarters. He really is a great man. See you later!
Professor Oak’s Pokémon Talk is a popular radio show, right? Did you know that he was going to turn down the show at first? But Mary’s energy and persistence wore him down. So we have Mary to thank for it! See you later!
Professor Oak used to be a Trainer a long time ago. But rather than battling, he found Pokémon themselves to be interesting. So he abandoned his training to focus on becoming a researcher. See you later!
Professor Oak has a granddaughter named Daisy. She has tea every day for an hour from three in the afternoon. I wish I could join her for tea and chat about Professor Oak. See you later!

Hey, you should listen when Teachers are talking to you!
Did you change your mind about exchanging phone numbers? [VAR(512, 0)]
You know, I’m pretty sure I just caught a glimpse of you... If you’re nearby, you shouldn’t talk over the phone. You should talk to me in person.
Hey! You got yet another zero on a test! You don’t pay attention to anything I’m saying in class, do you? Do you honestly think you can beat a Gym Leader with that kind of... Huh? You’re not Travis... Oh my goodness! I’m so sorry!
You know, I usually use [VAR(256, 10, 0)]. Don’t you enjoy battling using your best-loved Pokémon? But it gets kind of lonely to just keep using the same Pokémon over and over. Sometimes I like to walk along with Pokémon that I’ve just caught. That can also be a lot of fun, you know?
The other day, I was battling [VAR(256, 11, 0)] on Route 15. People stopped to watch, and soon there was this huge crowd gathered! I got so nervous... You know, I’m used to talking in front of a class of kids... but Pokémon battles are something else. I just can’t get comfortable battling in front of a crowd!
You know... This is just between us, right? The other day, I was trying to catch a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. I made a mistake and accidentally threw out the wrong Poké Ball, and the Pokémon got away. It’s a good thing none of my students were watching. But still, I was really embarrassed.
By the way, you’d like to prepare for Pokémon battles and do some review, wouldn’t you? We should have another Pokémon battle! I’m always on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. I’ll be waiting for you there!
Hey! Do you remember you made plans with me? We said we were going to meet on [VAR(260, 3, 0)] and have a Pokémon battle, right? Don’t forget!
That’s right... If you ask me which is cuter, my students or Pokémon, I’ll have a hard time making that decision. Come to think of it, for a lot of kids, their first Pokémon is the cutest one in the world in their young eyes. And there’s nothing that can be said to change that opinion.

Even though you’re nearby, talking on the phone makes you seem far away. Don’t be shy. Why not come talk to me in person?
There are some people out there who say, “You don’t need to give Bait to your caught Pokémon,” but I’m different. My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] does a great job. So I feed it delicious things, brush it, pet it, show it affection, and just cherish it!
Yesterday I went fishing and knocked out a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! I know that if I go to the mountains, or the forest, or the grassland, or the caves, or any place like that, I could find all kinds of Pokémon. But I just really like Pokémon like [VAR(256, 11, 0)], you know...
The biggest Pokémon is always the one you almost caught, you know? Just the other day, I had almost caught a [VAR(256, 11, 0)] when it ran away! I was so disappointed! When you’re fishing, don’t have any regrets! Fish with all your might! Hey! Fight!
I’m getting sick of fishing. I’d rather have a Pokémon battle with you! Hey! I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)].
Hello? We made plans to meet on [VAR(260, 3, 0)] for a battle, right? Hey! Hurry up and get here.
The real draw of fishing is that you never know what you’ll catch until you actually pull it up out of the water. Someday maybe I’ll pull up on the fishing Rod and there will be a legendary Pokémon on the other end of my line... Yeah, right. The chances of that happening are basically zero. For example, RAIKOU and the others, as they’re skipping around all over the place, maybe their feet would slip and they’d land in the sea... What do you think, could I accidentally catch RAIKOU while fishing? ...How silly, right?

We should trade phone numbers, so I can educate you more on the merits of Bug-type Pokémon![VAR(512, 0)]
You betcha. Thanks! I’ll call you sometime!
Don’t say such sad things...
Oh, did you decide to exchange phone numbers after all? [VAR(512, 0)]
Oh, there you are! I thought I’d give you a Berry, so I’ve been waiting here for you! Here you go! 
Wait, what? If you’re nearby, don’t bother with the phone. Come talk in person!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is growing up well, if I do say so myself! Why, in a recent battle against [VAR(256, 11, 0)], it knocked it out before I could blink! Before I could even blink! Amazing, eh?
Argh, I give up! My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] has gotten pretty strong, you know. I figured that it should be able to easily knock out a [VAR(256, 11, 0)]... But once we got a good look at it, we saw it was really high level... We got beaten up, down, and sideways...
You know, earlier by the roadside, this [VAR(256, 11, 0)] jumped out at me! I really love Pokémon, but...bam! It sure startled me! I mean, if you’re going to jump out at a person, you should at least have the decency to introduce yourself first!

You know, my dad was a researcher studying Bug-type Pokémon. Ever since I was young, there’s always been Bug-type Pokémon scattered all over the house. That’s why I started to like Bug-type Pokémon so much myself. My mom... Well, she screamed a lot.
I found some Berries. I’ve already got more than I need, so I’ll give you some! I’m on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Come pick them up!

I’d like you to have a Nugget. My PIKACHU just loves it. I’m certain your Pokémon will love it, too!
What’s wrong? I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Come and pick this up anytime.

So, at last... You’ve finally decided you want to learn from the best fisherman. That’s great. I’ll teach you. To start... Look out at the surface of the water. Breathe in deeply. Hold your fishing rod and stand still. Aim at a point quietly. And, SHOO-OOOP! Cast out your line! When you cast your line, keep a good grip, or your Fishing Rod will go with it. Make sure to hold on tight! The hook and line will sink down into the water, and you wait, just like that, without moving. Well, if your nose itches or something, I suppose it’s OK to move a little bit. And then, YOINK--you get a bite! YANK on the line and pull it out of the water! Got it? YOINK and YANK! If you YANK without a YOINK, you’ll look like a fool, pulling up nothing! Well, it might not be a YOINK, might be it’s a BLOOP or a PLOOSH or a BLOOSH, or even a SPLOOSH-SPLOOSH... ...Huh? I think we’re losing conn... ction... Can...hear... Hello...? He...

Hm? Wait, where are you? I’m pretty sure you’re nearby. If you’re going to come all the way over here, please feel free to approach me!
You know, I’ve learned a lot from watching you battle, and I’ve been practicing with my [VAR(256, 10, 0)]. Thanks to you, we’ve improved a lot! But even though we’ve grown stronger, you’ve probably gotten stronger at the same time, I guess. So...that means we still won’t be able to beat you, I guess!
I used the tips I learned from watching you battle to take down a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] the other day! Thanks to you, my Pokémon’s much stronger! If we get the chance to meet again, I hope you’ll show me some more tricks!
Hey, hey, listen up! A few days ago, I was trying to catch a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]... We went down to the wire, but it ended up getting away! I really should have had a bunch of Poké Balls ready, I know...
You know, lately I’ve been wanting to battle you again... What do you say? Are you interested? I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
Hello? Didn’t we make plans to meet on [VAR(260, 3, 0)] for a battle? I’m sure you couldn’t have forgotten! Get a move on, already!
Hey, you know why I’m always in shorts? It’s because they’re really cool! You know how, if you scuff your knees and you’re wearing shorts, everyone can see all the bandages? It makes me look wild and dangerous!

Your knowledge is impressive! I like that! Want to trade battle tips? I’ll phone if I get good info. Would you tell me your number?[VAR(512, 0)]
I’ll call you if I hear anything!
Oh, OK. Too bad... Well, if you ever want my number, come and see me, OK?
Want to trade battle tips? I’ll phone if I get good info. Would you tell me your number?[VAR(512, 0)]

What’s going on? We’re pretty close... Why not just come and talk in person?
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)]’s intelligence keeps rising. It might be smarter than yours! See you later!
The other day, I easily defeated a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. I think swapping tips with you is starting to help. See you later!
I missed catching a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] by just a tiny bit. If I’d been more informed, I’m sure I would’ve caught it... See you later!
Did you know...? When it’s raining, Thunder is sure to strike.
Did you know...? If you use Defense Curl, Rollout’s power goes way up past normal.
Did you know...? If the sunlight is harsh, Solarbeam doesn’t need to be charged up.
Did you know...? If the opponent uses Minimize, your Stomp becomes more powerful.
Did you know...? If your opponent is Flying, your Gust becomes much more powerful.
Did you know...? If your opponent is Flying, your Twister becomes more powerful.
Did you know...? If your opponent uses Dig, your Earthquake becomes more powerful.
Did you know...? If your opponent uses Dig, your Magnitude becomes more powerful.
Did you know...? The Rock, Ground, and Steel types can’t be hurt by Sandstorm.
Did you know...? If the sunlight is harsh, Water-type moves become much weaker.
Did you know...? When it’s raining, Fire-type moves become much weaker than usual.
Do you want to battle? I’ll show you how to battle logically. I’ll be in [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Give me a shout if you’re nearby.
Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Do you remember your promise? We have to battle soon! I’ll be at [VAR(260, 3, 0)].
Hey, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Do you remember your promise? We have to battle soon! I’ll be at [VAR(260, 3, 0)].

Wow, you’re tough. I haven’t battled that seriously in a long time. Could I get your phone number? I’d like to battle again after I heal my Pokémon. [VAR(512, 0)]

OK... I understand... But if you change your mind, give me a shout anytime.

My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] might be greater than I imagined. I doubt I’ll see a wild [VAR(256, 10, 0)] that’s better than mine.
A while back, I tried to catch a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. It managed to elude me. One wrong decision could mean total failure... You ought to be careful, too.
I managed to barely defeat [VAR(256, 11, 0)] the other day. I’ve never seen a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] get that strong... You shouldn’t let your guard down, even against a Pokémon you’re used to seeing.
Let’s battle! I’ll be waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. Give me a shout when you’re close.
[VAR(259, 0, 0)], why aren’t you here? I’ll take you down on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!

Our battle was remarkable! I wish for something to remember you by! Perhaps your phone number will do? My training makes it impossible to chat much, but... [VAR(512, 0)]
I must train harder to become the mightiest!
If you decide you want my number, come and find me.
My training makes chatting tough. So, take down my number? [VAR(512, 0)]
Today, I’d like to thank you, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I’ve been training all alone... I was happy that you cared to call... [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! I want you to have this! 
Your strength will not let you carry another thing! I will hold this till you lighten your Bag!
Excuse me? If you’re nearby, then I’d appreciate the politeness of talking face-to-face!
Are you still on your journey? I remain dedicated to my training. Oooooaaarrrgh!
My apologies, but I don’t have time to chat while I am in training! I’ll have time to chat tomorrow! Yiiihah!
I plan to take a lunch break, so come and visit with me then! Ayiiiyah!
I’m taking a break on Route 45! Why not drop by? We can have a battle!
I rested up over my lunch break. Now, it’s time to resume training! Oooryaah!

Hey, how about we exchange phone numbers before we eat?[VAR(512, 0)]
I’ve always got my Pokégear in reach, so if you give me a call, I’ll answer pretty quick! 
Don’t worry! I’m a really nice Camper...
Did you decide you’d like to trade numbers with me after all?[VAR(512, 0)]
Yeah! Hey, here you are! I’ve been holding on to this just for you. Don’t be shy--go ahead and take it. It’s a present! 
Hm? Oh, you’re just around the corner? If you’re that close, why bother with a phone call? Humph!
You know, it’s perfectly fine to be all affectionate to your Pokémon and let them live in your house. But I prefer to go out camping with my constant companion, [VAR(256, 10, 0)], which is why it’s so strong! That reminds me--we knocked out a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)], whammo! Just like that, the other day. You should’ve seen it...
About all this training your Pokémon just so you can catch stronger wild Pokémon... It’s not a good idea to be throwing Poké Balls around recklessly, trying to catch any old thing. You need to build up a close connection with your Pokémon. My relationship with my [VAR(256, 10, 0)] is a perfect example. ...Well, I say that, but the other day we had a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] just barely get away from us. No matter how much I’d rather not think about it, I can’t let the thoughts go...
Hear me out! Earlier, we met a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! It kind of jumped out as we were on the way home from a camping excursion! I was so surprised! I guess it goes to show you shouldn’t let your guard down when you’re out in nature!
I was getting ready to cook up some chow, and I started thinking about you. Before I sit down to eat, would you like to battle again? I’m on [VAR(260, 3, 0)], so bring your best Pokémon!
Huh? What’s going on? Did you get lost or something? Stay calm... I am right smack on [VAR(260, 3, 0)], so you should have no trouble finding me!
Do you know the difference between going on a picnic and camping? It’s a song, of course! When you’re going on a picnic, you sing a happy, upbeat little tune as you hike over hills and fields. When you’re camping, you sing quiet, mournful songs of grief and loss while sitting and staring at the campfire. What? You don’t believe me? Then we should go camping sometime and sit around the fire and see what kind of melodies you feel like singing!
Recently, I was digging a fire pit in the ground so I could cook supper, and I found an unusual item! Apparently this thing is called a Sun Stone. I’ll give it to you. I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
I still have that Sun Stone I said I’d give you! I’m waiting on [VAR(260, 3, 0)], so come and get it as soon as you can!

No? That’s fine. A definite no is easy to take! I’ll be right here when you’re ready for a rematch.
So you want to register my phone number for a rematch, huh?[VAR(512, 0)]
Well, you are special, all right. If only I’d begun training Pokémon when I was a tad younger... I want you to work hard and succeed for both of us. So, take this, OK? 
Uh-huh? Is that a river I hear in the background? You’re nearby!
Nothing can match my [VAR(256, 10, 0)] now. Yeah, we KO’d a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]! That was OK, but what I wanted was to catch it... OK, give me a call again!
Nothing can match my [VAR(256, 10, 0)] now. And, yesterday, we spotted a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. We were debating whether to catch it or just gain experience battling it. Then, along came another guy, who caught it! How about that! OK, give me a call again!
You’re thinking you’d like to battle me. Am I right or what? Yep! We’ll meet on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
Haven’t you gone as far as [VAR(260, 3, 0)]? Waiting here is no problem, but I’d sure like to battle!

Wah ha ha! [VAR(259, 0, 0)]! Here’s that Dawn Stone you wanted. Here you go. ...And now that you’ve got what you came here for, SCRAM! 
It’s dangerous to talk on the phone while riding on Cycling Road, but sometimes I’ve got no choice! If you’re nearby, let’s talk in person!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] has gotten way strong! It knocked out a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] in, like, two seconds! Wahahahahahahaha! ...What? You think I’m exaggerating? Put a lid on it! Nothing but truth!
My [VAR(256, 10, 0)] has gotten awesomely strong! We can go catch [VAR(256, 11, 0)] now!
Recently, I came across a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] on the road. Suddenly, out it jumps! I fell off my Bike trying not to hit it! But it’s all good, even though I got a little scraped up. It’s all good ’cause I like to be nice to wild Pokémon!
Hey! Right now, I’m on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]! Don’t run, don’t hide, just get over here and fight me!
Listen! Here I wait on good old [VAR(260, 3, 0)]! Time for us to have another battle, fair and square, so come alone! Wait... Bring your Pokémon with you! Without a Pokémon, we can’t battle!
You... You’ve got a Pokémon with you, right? That’s... That’s pretty sweet, isn’t it? If you were blazing up and down the road as fast as you could, like me, you wouldn’t be able to have your Pokémon alongside you. Makes me a bit jealous of you, to tell the truth.
Hey! I picked up something great! I checked it with someone who knows this stuff. They said it’s a Dawn Stone. If you want it, I’m on [VAR(260, 3, 0)], so come and get it!
Listen! Pick up the pace and pick up this Dawn Stone! On [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!

Mostly I breathe fire, but want to exchange phone numbers? [VAR(512, 0)]
All right! Don’t worry. I’ll stop breathing fire while we’re talking on the phone... so give me a call sometime!
I knew that us Firebreathers weren’t particularly well liked...
Oh! Would you like to breathe fire with me? ...Oh, you don’t. Would you like to exchange phone numbers with me after all? [VAR(512, 0)]
It’s all right. I promise I won’t burn you, so you can come talk to me in person.
You know, a lot of people misunderstand. It may seem like we Firebreathers use fire to threaten our Pokémon while training them. But that’s not the case at all! We just train our Pokémon normally! Isn’t that right, [VAR(256, 10, 0)]? Breathing fire is just a hobby!
Buoahhhbobobo! What do you think? I discovered a new technique for breathing fire! Well, not like you can tell over the phone... Never mind that. I caught a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] yesterday. I think I’ll start training it soon.
Do you like [VAR(256, 11, 0)]? As for me...they’re all right. There’s all kinds of things in this world.
Buoahhhbobobo! Today is a great day! You should have another battle with me! I’m waiting and practicing on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]!
I’m all ready, and waiting for you on [VAR(260, 3, 0)], so hurry up!
You know how there are so many different types of Pokémon, right? Each type has good points and bad points, so it’s not easy to say which type is the best. However... My choice has to be the Fire type! Buoahhhbobobo!!
Did you know that today’s the Bug-Catching Competition? I’m not that into Bug-type Pokémon, but the National Park isn’t that far from Route 35... I thought I might go check it out.

By the way, I’m a Hiker, so I often go to mountains and caves. I don’t usually go to the town. I bet you go to all kinds of towns on your journey, don’t you? You know, if we were to trade phone numbers, then we could exchange all kinds of information, yes? [VAR(512, 0)]
I’ll give you a call when I think of a good, heart-warming story, OK?
That’s so sad. I might just end up secluding myself in the mountain...
What do you say? Would you like to exchange numbers with another adventurer? [VAR(512, 0)]
You’re nearby, and yet you’re going to call me on the phone? Am I that “dazzling” that you need to keep your distance?
The other day, I was watching my [VAR(256, 10, 0)] eat some Berries. It looked like it was enjoying its meal, so I decided to try some. I’m not sure if people should eat that stuff, but it was delicious! All right then! Be good!
Lately, I’ve been running across wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] quite often. They’re easily taken care of. All right then! Be good!

I’ve been spending more time with my [VAR(256, 10, 0)] than I have with my kids. That’s a bit sad, actually. You call your mom sometimes, too!
I just beat a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)]. I told my kid, but he scoffed that he could do the same thing easily. Boy, has he gotten cocky... You call your mom sometimes, too!
Yesterday a wild [VAR(256, 11, 0)] slipped away from me in front of my kid. I was feeling down about it until he shared his Poké Balls with me. Hahah, that sure made my day! You call your mom sometimes, too!
What do you say to a battle with me? Good, you’re going to do it! For a kid, you’re quite agreeable. [VAR(260, 3, 0)] is the spot!
So where are you? I’m waiting for you to show up on [VAR(260, 3, 0)]. You shouldn’t make your elders wait!

H-hello? [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? It’s a disaster! Uh, um, it’s just terrible! What should I do? It... Oh, no... Please get back here now!

Hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? We’ve discovered something! The details are...well, I can’t really say anything, but we want you to carry that Egg! My assistant is at the Poké Mart in Violet City. Could you go meet him and pick up that Egg?

[VAR(259, 0, 0)], how are things going? I called because something weird is happening with the radio broadcasts. They were talking about Team Rocket. [VAR(259, 0, 0)], do you know anything about it? Maybe Team Rocket has returned. No, that just can’t be true. Sorry to bug you. Take care!

Hello, [VAR(259, 0, 0)]? I discovered an odd thing. Apparently there’s something called Pokérus that infects Pokémon. Yes, it’s like a virus, so it’s called Pokérus. It multiplies fast and infects other Pokémon, too. But that’s all. It doesn’t seem to do anything, and it goes away over time. I guess it’s nothing to worry about. Bye!

Here I come!
Yeah! 
Bleah! 
Hey, rookie! Bring it on!
Yeah, I knew it. You’re a rookie after all. 
Bleah! You’re just a rookie! 
I gotta say it, shorts are the best! They remain comfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest! 
I’ll never stop wearing shorts. Not for anybody! 
I make it a policy to wear miniskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate! 
What’s your policy? 
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing! 
Miniskirts make legs look longer! Is that a good thing? 
I’m on the lookout for adorable Accessories.
Let me know if you find any nice Accessories! 
I wish I could dress up! 
I want to test out something I learned at private school.
Yes! It worked perfectly! 
Hmm... Something’s wrong here. 
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and willpower. 
OK, so willpower doesn’t cut it on its own. 
I study every day because I want to work all over the world.
My dream is worldwide! 
I need to study up on Pokémon battles. 
When I grow up, I’m going to be a Pokémon professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem! You’ve much to learn, youngster! 
Er-hem! Er-hem! Seems I’ve much to learn still! 
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply don’t lose!
It’s a victory of knowledge! 
I’m going to review the subject! And I’ll subject you to my revenge! 
Oh, now you look wimpy. I might win this.
I so did it! 
Ouch, that hurt. 
It’s fine, fine. No need to say a word.
It’s fine, fine. You tried your best, I know. 
It’s fine, fine... No need to say a word... 
I’m rich!
Well, of course. I’m rich. 
What happened? I’m rich, aren’t I? 
Hmm. So, you’re good, huh?
Hmm. You’re no big deal. Hmm? 
Hmm. So, you are good. Hmm. 
Oh, yes. I shall attack now.
I’ve done it! 
Oh, how disappointing. 
Over it is, your adventure. Come hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was. 
Oh, how vexing this so is. Verily, I thank you. 
How boring...
So truly boring... 
That was a good way to waste some time. 
Hunh? Where is everyone?
Hey, guys! Where are you?! 
I came to camp, but I think I got separated from my friends... 
Oh! Don’t you have a Pokétch, too?
I was fooling around with my Pokétch, but I still won! 
I was fooling around with my Pokétch, and I lost... 
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It’s the power of the forests. 
I’m going back to the forest. 
I’ll battle you like I’m on a picnic!
Lalala! 
Pretending this is a picnic won’t let me win. 
Ooh-la-la! Here we come!
Ooh-la-la! So happy I won! 
Ooh-la-la! Even losing can’t dampen my spirits! 
I’ll teach you what’s fun about battling.
Battling me was fun, wasn’t it? 
Oh, my, that was inspiring! You’re the greatest! 
I... I can swim, really! I don’t need my inflatable tube!
It... It’s true! 
I... I’m not lying! 
I like rivers more than the sea. Which do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels just super. 
I don’t like the sea because the salty water burns my eyes! 
Go, go, go! Go, my Pokémon!
That’s the way! Way to go, my Pokémon! 
Good effort! Way to go, my Pokémon! 
The beach sand is so hot! It makes me go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea! 
Ouch, ouch, ouch! 
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash! Ker-splash! 
Flip, flop! 
I’m a girl in love with her inflatable tube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I’m a girl in love with her inflatable tube! 
Good-bye! I’m a girl in love with her inflatable tube! 
Oh, yeah! I’m feeling it! I’m tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah! 
Tch! Losing threw off my rhythm! 
Rock? Jazz? Techno? Anything’ll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal! 
So, yeah... You’ve got me in the mood for singing the blues... 
Let’s get this session on!
You’re obviously short on practice. 
My dream of a world tour... It seems so far away... 
Oh, hello... Well, isn’t that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf? 
Oh, you! You’re not just fashionable, you’re good with Pokémon! How unfair! 
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh? You’re not my fan? 
What a horrible way to treat an Idol... 
La, lala, lah.
La lalala. Lalalah lah. 
Bye-bye, lalah! 
Let’s see who loves Pokémon more, you or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for Pokémon trumped yours! 
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is stronger than mine? 
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind of tough.
You don’t want to underestimate me. 
You’re some kind of mighty. 
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon. Don’t be shy now, come on.
I see... Cute, but on the weak side. 
I see! Cute, and yet tough. 
My Pokémon are cute, but they’re not very tough!
Oh? We won? Seriously? 
It’s OK. I like my Pokémon. That’s all that matters. 
I’ve been pampering my gang too much lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it! I knew I could count on my gang! 
Pampering Pokémon too much is no good... 
Won’t you join our Pokémon Fan Club?
There’s all sorts of fun things to do if you join! 
Join us! Become a Pokéfan like me! 
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice. One loss served fresh. 
Ah, an excellent choice. A win served fresh. 
What I really hoped to become was a cook.
I don’t mind this job now, mind you. 
I just find it hard talking to strangers. 
For battles and order taking, speed is essential!
Like, chop-chop! You got served. 
Food is like battling. Serve it while it’s hot! 
My job is about serving others. But don’t expect me to serve here.
Mufufu. 
Why couldn’t you serve me? You won’t make friends that way! 
Isn’t this cute? My uniform.
It’s my favorite! 
You messed up my uniform! 
You’re good, aren’t you?
Oops. I’m a little disappointed. 
I knew you were a tough Trainer. 
I catch and raise all sorts of Pokémon.
See? I’ve raised them pretty good. 
I need to raise my Pokémon some more! 
I’ll snag you with my net!
It’s in the bag! 
Hey! Don’t run away! 
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS. Like, king size! 
If only I had a giant HERACROSS... 
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine! 
I lie shattered... 
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah! You saw it! 
You didn’t fall for my fake ninja boasting! 
I shall become a real ninja when I grow up!
Excellent! Excellent! 
So, what’s a real ninja supposed to do? 
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay! 
No! No tormenting me! 
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn’t it cute? 
My mommy is really good at sewing. 
Let’s do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone! 
Waaaaah! 
Sure, we’re going to battle, but don’t be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax. It’s best to be natural, dig? 
You have to loosen up some more. 
Fish, fish, fish, that’s what I do! I’m gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah! I am at the top of my game! 
Oh, waah! I let that get away! 
Exploring for relics isn’t all fun and games!
Your skill level says you probably won’t make a good Ruin Maniac. 
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins! 
These mates of mine traveled the world with me!
What do you say? Pretty tough, right? 
Maybe it’s time we hit the road again... 
Hey, there! Check this out! My rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either. My Pokémon are tough, too! 
Aiyah! Hey! Wait! No! Stop! Don’t touch! 
Now just be patient. I’ll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren’t they awesome? They’re the most super of the uber! 
Awawawah... My... My Pokémon... 
Look! This is my favorite parasol! Oh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren’t they both cute? 
I’m only showing you! You can’t have any! 
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond a rainbow? 
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good things are in store. 
If you were the weather, what would you be now?
Right now, I’m feeling sunny without a cloud in the sky! 
I’m feeling fogbound... 
I really don’t like weak Trainers!
You don’t inspire much trust... 
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough and bursting with life! 
Lately, I’ve had a lot to worry about...
Winning makes all my worries seem trivial! 
You just added to my worries... 
This may hurt a little bit, but we’ll be done quick. Hold still!
There! Done! 
Ooh, no! That hurts! 
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle... I think I have a cold... 
Sniff... Sniffle... My nose is clogging up... 
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be? 
Do you have some cologne on? You smell sort of nice! 
You’re going to lose, but you’ll get to enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That’s what you get for swooning to my aroma! 
Kiiiih! I am so angry! 
Let my guitar howl! Hear me scream!
Yeahey! 
Giyaaaah! 
You should channel your feelings into songs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now? It’s rock! 
The way I feel now is kind of folksy. 
Now hear me! The Bird Keeper’s credo number one!
Soar high on a win! 
Rest your wings on a loss! 
Let’s both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could! 
Good going! 
Fly, fly, fly! We’re going to rule this battle!
Zoom! 
We’re gonna crash! 
I’m the Sailor among Sailors! I was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep! The sea was my mother! 
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on land, I get no-motion sickness... 
I love the sea after all...
Oh... I hear them... I hear the sound of waves... 
I want to become a big man. Big like the sea big. 
Yahoo!
Come on! You holler too! 
Gweff! Hack! Hack! Hollering choked me up! 
You should aspire to the Hiker’s way of life!
You see? You love my lifestyle, don’t you? 
Now, come on now! You should look up to the way I live! 
My Pokémon and I are Idols!
Say what you will! We’re Idols! 
We have you beat when it comes down to popularity... 
Watch me! All eyes on me!
Ooh... This is what I live for... 
I became an Idol because I wanted everyone to see me! 
I’m too into battling... They might fire me as an Idol...
Battling is too much fun! 
I can’t help myself. No one can keep me from battling. 
I run a marathon every morning! It’s great!
My buff physique makes for easy wins! 
So I lost! I can still run great marathons! 
I’ll run on the spot while battling for the good of my health.
Let’s hear it for good health! 
Gasp! My ankle! I rolled my ankle! 
Out of the way! I’ve got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you somewhere, too? 
All the delivering I do every day... I’ve got deep muscle pain! 
It was me who put up the buildings around these parts.
So, what do you think? Cool stuff, huh? 
My dream is to make a building taller than a mountain! 
Smell that? That’s the smell of hay clinging to my body.
Whoa! 
This smell I have is the sweet scent of hay that Pokémon surely love. 
All right, take a run at me! My barrel chest can take it!
What? That’s all you’ve got? You can take a harder run at me! 
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It’s like you broke my barrel chest... 
I’m not getting any younger. I can’t overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for in experience. 
Oh, you’re good and young. There’s a sparkle about you. 
Hey! You there, Trainer! You and me, we’re battling!
Owned! 
Unbelievable! 
These here are my Pokémon. I raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren’t they? 
Well, I’ll be! We lost that one! 
I’m going to do my level best. You’d better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best! 
Yup! We tried hard, y’all! 
OK, everyone! Big smiles!
Big smiles! Come on! 
That’s a great smile! Your victory pose is picture perfect, too! 
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus! 
Zoom out, fade... 
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff... My camera’s toughened me up. 
Oof... I’m feeling groggy... 
Hello there, Trainer! Please battle with me!
Thanks for your help! 
I appreciate the lesson! 
I’ll do anything for a good news story!
I’m relentless about battling, too! 
Stop! Please, stop! You’ll break my mic! 
So, the question is, what is your opinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that what you’re thinking? 
I’m doing a live report on the topic of myself! 
Come on! We’ll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal! 
Wait! Don’t leave me behind! 
Gear change! We’re attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom! 
Kaboom! 
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at a full run?
Too slow! 
I’m taking it to a zone beyond speed! 
I’d rather cycle casually than go full speed.
Let’s take it easy. 
You ought to take things more casually... 
I only know how to go at full power, even against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win! 
Please! Let me call you Master Trainer from now on! 
My spirit burns, my fists are steel, and my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph! 
I sweated more. That makes me the victor! 
En garde!
I’m still ready for more. 
Urgh... Don’t you forget this! 
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight! 
You’re not bad, you. 
The ultimate of my techniques! Experience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest! Gwahahaha! 
I’ve fallen in defeat? Gw-gwaaah! 
Hi! Little kid! A battle, please!
Little kid! Thank you very kindly! 
Little kid! I’m really upset over this! 
I, um... I’ve never actually learned how to do karate.
You’re kidding?! I’m naturally talented?! 
A Black Belt is cool, huh? So I just dress up like one. 
It’s been five years since I took to the mountains. My hair’s grown wild!
I bathe every day! How dare you? 
Another five years...? 
Did I catch you smirking at my eight-pack abs?
You don’t appreciate the beauty of pure muscles! 
Musculature is the ultimate beauty! 
In love and in battles, I’ve never tasted defeat!
See? We won again! 
So, I lost. I don’t care! I have a date soon, so I don’t care! 
This is it! Over the top! Everyone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen! Victory is ours! 
Retreat! Sound the retreat! 
My career as a Trainer dates back 75 years. You think you can win?
Here’s a toast to my history! 
My history of glory... 
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was. 
I tip my hat to you. 
Oh, my... Such an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed? How adorable... 
I see... You’re more than simply adorable. 
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn’t you say? I find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp... Oh, dear... I’m worn out. 
Being rich doesn’t shield me from having worries...
Of course, being well off is much preferable to poverty, but... 
Lavish parties day after day... It gets rather tiresome, I must say. 
Come to know defeat... Learn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more powerful... 
The defeated merely slink away... 
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell! 
My power of suggestion failed to charm you! 
...
...Did it. 
I focused my mind in silence... 
My powers! There’s no trickery about them!
This is psychic power! 
There really is no trickery... 
Take it all!
Ahaha! 
Gah! 
Close your eyes and count... Slow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my victory! 
Tch... I thought I could lull you to sleep. 
I live among Pokémon.
I’ve never been much of a battler, but... 
I’m just not much of a battler. 
...They’re Pokémon I’ve raised with my father...
...Dad, are you seeing this? I did it... 
Dad, I can’t... I need to raise them some more... 
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of honest effort!
Yahaha! I’ve had a hands-on time raising those Pokémon! 
Urgwah! Look what you’ve done to my Pokémon! 
Will you have a look at the Pokémon I’ve raised?
Well? Cute, aren’t they? 
Cut a girl some slack! 
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right? 
Oh, but they’re so cute! 
Nice to meet you! Underestimate me at your peril!
Told you! 
I guess I underestimated you... 
Hmhm... I must say I like the look in your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat. Like jewels they are! 
Your eyes shine brighter than any big gemstone I keep at home! 
When I was your age, I was quite the daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild youth. 
I daresay, you’re quite the daredevil yourself! 
If you want to run home to mommy, here’s your chance, punk!
Geheheh! 
Waah! I want my mommy! 
Battles achieve nothing! Take my hand! It’s about love!
I didn’t mean to battle--but take my hand! It’s about love! 
Battling is futile! Take my hand! It’s about love! 
I dropped my glasses. I can’t see straight.
I guess I won. I can’t see enough to tell. 
I guess I lost. I can’t see enough to tell. 
Steadily and surely. You build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won! 
But I did things steadily and surely... 
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha! 
Sob, sob, sob... 
Everybody gather around for my stupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn’t that amusing? 
Nrrgh... I am not amused. 
I shall train with you.
Show some spine! On your feet! 
Fine! That will do! 
Why get all intellectual about things? If it’s fun, why question it?
See, I can still win. I don’t see a problem! 
So I lost! If it’s fun, it’s cool! 
I expect you to be good... Don’t you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced... 
You’ve got good things. 
My papa and mama are high-skill Trainers, too.
It’s in my lineage! 
Papa, Mama! I’m so sorry! 
I go all out in battle, no matter what.
The inevitable conclusion! 
I concede! 
This is it! The biggest battle in my life! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah! 
This sets me back to being a Lass... 
My love of nature and Pokémon made a Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too! 
Ooh... I still love to battle, too. 
Hi! Have you ever considered a career as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your skill level. 
Yes, you’ve got the mettle. Being a Ranger is a lot of fun! 
Win or lose, a battle happens only once!
Do you have any regrets? 
I have no regrets! 
It’s my sworn duty to protect nature and the Pokémon in it.
It’s a challenging life, but there’s a lot to enjoy every day. 
It’s a rewarding career. How does it sound to you? 
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking on you!
Well? Satisfied? 
Well, aren’t you tough? I’m a little stunned! 
I didn’t sleep while trying to come up with this new strategy!
My strategy worked! 
Oh, but... I really needed to sleep tonight... 
The credo of the Dragon Tamer! Number one!
In victory, roar! Roar with your dragon! 
Even in defeat, roar! Roar with your dragon! 
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am! 
...Urf... I wanted to be strong... 
See it! Feel it! The ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the ultimate... Probably! 
The title of the ultimate probably! I confer it on you! 
Oh, wow! Rare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That’s what you get for letting down your guard. 
Tch. Couldn’t fool you. 
I can’t stand getting cold, but I’m quite good.
Ch-chatter... Wa-wahaha. I won, I won! 
Ch-chatter... Urr... I’m getting sleepy... 
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me! Not too shabby! 
I like the sense you show! 
Snow is wonderful! Everything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic! 
I’m whiting out... 
Don’t you think this coat is cute? It limits my movements, though.
It’s toasty warm. 
I feel snowed under... 
I’m the one! Number one out of all the kids in shorts!
See? That’s what being number one is about! 
Darn... I’m number one... 
I’m the one! The only one true one among shorts-wearing kids!
See? That’s what being the only one is about! 
Ack... I’m the only one... 
Um... I’m pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won? Um? S-sorry. 
Er, um... Th-thank you... 
Here goes!
Bravo! 
Yelp! 
You learn, too!
The harsh realities of battling! 
The joy of victory! 
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn. 
I get it now. In that situation, I should have used that move. 
My teacher gave me advice on battling.
My teacher was right! That was just so easy! 
Aww, my teacher was wrong! None of it worked! 
Why are we battling? I don’t get it.
Why? I don’t understand. 
Why did you win? What happens now? 
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another brand. You know who’ll win, right?
I’m not interested in what was an inevitable result. 
But how... My... The Pokémon I’ve raised... 
There isn’t anything that I can’t buy. Money can buy battles!
There’s nothing that money can’t buy. 
I’ll give you my allowance if you’ll let me win. 
You know, I’m really not cut out for doing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah! 
You swine! Now I’m steamed! 
I’ll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done! 
Lickety-split is how I’ll excuse myself! 
Crunch-crunch... Crunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies... 
What am I standing on? Busted Poké Balls? 
The way of the Bug Catcher! Bear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher! 
All hail Bug Catchers! 
Feast your eyes on secret techniques of the ancients!
See? What did you think? Are you awestruck? 
That’s my cue to disappear in a puff of smoke. 
I see it!
Think not ill of me... 
Gyoeeeh! 
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah! 
Pi pika... 
A battle, you say? I’m never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee! I won, I won! 
Urk... We lost... 
It’s my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank! 
Ugagaah! You rotten thief! 
You can shake hands with me! It would be quite the honor for you!
If you’d won, I would have even given you my autograph! 
My management team will have something to say about this! 
Run! Don’t think! Run!
Faster! More! More! Faster! 
Run! Keep running for me! 
Hiya. Nice to meet ya.
All right. Nice seeing ya. 
All right. Thanks for coming by. 
My cohorts call me the emperor of fishing!
I landed another big one today! 
Why the emperor of fishing? It’s an ancient Chinese legend... 
When you get as good as me, you can win easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz... 
Sssnore... 
My mom and I travel around in search of lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and tend to crops every single day. 
You sure seem to be hectic. 
Win! That’s what I’ll do again today! I’ll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha! I’m not gonna lose my whole life! 
Nooooo! No way! I didn’t lose! 
Allow me to examine your prowess as a collector.
You’re still wanting. I urge you to keep at it. 
That’s quite the collection. I’m willing to relieve you of the lot. 
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir! 
Owowowoooh! 
I want you to hear it! A shout from the heart!
I love music! 
Let’s hear it for an encore! 
Battle? I’m up for that.
Wow. Good stuff. 
Thanks much. 
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap! 
I’m gonna pluck you for that! 
Sure, let’s duke it out!
Let’s battle again! 
You’re not half bad! 
Looking out over the sea’s breaking waves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar! Daddy! 
Wroaaaar! Mommy! 
Come on! Take a run at me! I can take it!
So, what’d you think? I was too burly for you to handle? 
Good job! Way to overcome my size! 
Waah! Wait! Wait a second! My mind’s not into this yet!
Hunh? It’s over already? What? I won, you say? 
Huh? Hah? It’s over already? What? I lost, you say? 
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk. Got some?
Wahaha! I get the win! Let’s celebrate over some Moomoo Milk! 
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk! Bring me some Moomoo Milk! 
You’re under arrest! You’re under arrest!
Takedown! 
Officer down! 
I’m not a real Policeman. I’m a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you. You should try to find one you like. 
I must say, battling is a wonderful thing. 
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the next. That’s how it goes. 
I might win tomorrow. That’s what I believe. 
I’m throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo! 
It’s over! 
The indefatigable Camper makes his stand!
You can become a devotee if you’d like. 
I wish I could become your devotee. 
I don’t think I have any chance of winning, but sure, I’ll battle.
Wow, I wasn’t expecting to win. 
I knew I’d lose. I’m so sorry for this. 
I think you’re awfully interested in me, aren’t you?
You lost because you were paying too much attention to me. 
Why did you win? I thought you liked me. 
Win or lose, let’s not bear any grudges.
Yay, yay, yay! We did it! 
Oh, you! Don’t ever forget this! 
Pokémon are for adults, too... Let me show you...
What do you think? Am I deep like an old blues man? 
Though it cuts me deep, it’s a man’s lot in life to endure the pain... 
What I have here isn’t really a guitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt... 
This here is a keyboard synth. 
For work, I sometimes get to be a Swimmer or a Beauty.
An Idol can become anybody! 
But the real me... I’m still a Lass in a miniskirt! 
Let’s enjoy ourselves. I hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun! 
Yowch! Watch it! You play too rough! 
I’ll put an end to this! With my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is complete and perfectly strong... 
Why? Why?! Why did I lose?! 
Living with Pokémon... Every day is the greatest.
Ehehe... Pokémon are the best... 
It’s not a problem if I lose. I still have my Pokémon... 
I have my Pokémon. I don’t need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy every day. 
Isn’t that the same for you? Isn’t it? 
You won’t guess it now, but I was quite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know. 
I feel nostalgic for those days... 
Do your best! My beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done! Mama’s proud of you! 
My Pokémon are my beloved family. 
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which. Let’s do this!
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which, but sorry. 
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which, but you’re sure tough! 
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it’s over. 
Too much for me to handle! 
We’re going for the win! Hey-ho, let’s go!
Yay! Vavavoom! 
Aww, we lost... Sniffle... 
Let me introduce to you my cherished partners!
How did you find them? My cherished partners. 
Awawa... My partners... 
Winning and losing isn’t all there is to battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when I win. 
The effort you put in is what’s important. 
It’s no good to be too harsh... But pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep and complex challenge. 
Balance is key for raising good Pokémon. 
I’ll check how your Pokémon have grown for you.
Not good enough! Your training style’s not up to par. 
This is impressive! You’ve raised your Pokémon really thoroughly. 
I’ll win. No lie.
See? 
Huh! 
Fwaah! Fwaah! You think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah! I win! 
Fwaah! 
I’ve caught you now. Give up.
You weren’t bad. Let’s meet again. 
How could this be...? 
Yo, yo! Let’s have a fun time!
Thank you! Let’s play again! 
Thanks! Play with me again! 
You’re no good at all. I’d better teach you.
No, no, this won’t do at all. Up on your feet. Never give up! 
You’ve got good skills. You tried hard, too. Excellent! 
I’m jacking up the power to max! All the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I’m feeling electric! 
Eeyow! I got zapped! 
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak! Keep trying! 
Hoh! You are tough! Give me a rematch! 
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That’s it? 
OK... Quite remarkable... 
Ahaha! Too bad for you! I’m your opponent!
Ahaha! 
Aha... Ahaha... 
Are you nervous? Leave it to the dude!
That was a good battle. I hope we can meet again. 
Whew... The dude wasn’t expecting to lose. 
The power of nature! Let me show you!
This is the power of nature! 
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
See? I thought this would happen. 
Boo! Boo! This is not right! 
Fuhahaha! Your next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you could defeat me? 
Fuhahaha! Let us meet again! 
Off you go! Face my team of totally trained Pokémon!
Bravo! I knew my Pokémon would do it! 
Oh, no! That’s awful! What have you done to my Pokémon?! 
A battle is deadly earnest! Not a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard! 
I seemed to have let my mind wander... 
Hey!
Heeey! 
Hey... 
I’m tough, that’s all.
I won, that’s all. 
I lost, that’s all. 
Shaah!
Hwooh! 
Hawah! 
I’ve been here for years, but I never get tired of this.
You might not think so, but I’m still a kid. I’m in the same grade as you. 
I’d like to keep battling Pokémon even when my hair is gray. 
Let me make one thing clear... You aren’t capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible chance of you beating me. 
How could this be...? Only that girl with the inflatable tube has beaten me... 
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days... So careless. 
Children these days... Quite exuberant, methinks. 
I would like my children to become strong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn’t do if my children were only as good as you... 
It would be nice if they were as skilled as you... 
Behold you shall! Psychic-mystifying power!
You see? Psychic-mystifying power! 
No, but... Psychic-mystifying power... 
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family! That’ll be enough already! 
My beloved family... 
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy? 
Ooorgh... My head’s spinning... 
My big brother told me! Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it! My big brother’s plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower the foe’s accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough. This is gonna be fun!
I thought so! You are tough! 
Yup, you sure are tough. Keep it up! 
Ah, welcome! I’m your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill? 
Thank you so much! 
Hello. Whatcha having?
Thanks a million! 
Be seeing ya! 
I love cute customers like you! I’ll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way I served you? 
Oh, but... I’m not done serving you. 
Stare...
You’ve got something on your nose. 
You’re cool, all right. I had to stare. 
I’ve waited a long time for a Trainer like you to come along.
Yup, you’re as tough as I thought. You even had me in trouble! 
I knew it! You are a tough Trainer! 
Now how should I conduct this offensive?
Oh, now, I need a better effort out of you than that. 
Oh, you’re finished and content? OK, another time, then. 
My Pokémon have a different taste from the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference? My party has rich depth. 
Did you notice the difference? My party is refreshingly dry. 
Hiya! Tough-looking Trainer, aren’t you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling up in me! 
Ooch... You’re too much to handle. 
Varrroooom! Watch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom! I’m not close to redlining! 
Vrrr... Vrruuu... I’m flat out of gas... 
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech! 
Thud! 
It’s my dream to cycle with my boyfriend.
No riding double, though! 
I wish I had a boyfriend! 
What’s your motive? What brought you here?
You lose. Now what will you do? 
Play it again. 
We’ll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique. 
I remain humbled... 
You’re serious? A battle? And that’s against me?
Cackle! You shouldn’t have tried! 
Double wow! 
I’ll dance and sing and rivet your attention!
Ooh, baby! 
So much for riveting your attention. You nailed my Pokémon! 
Ready, start!
First across the finish line! 
Waah! Wait for me! 
Can you explain why I’m here?
I mean, who are you? 
Why am I battling here? 
My fishing-rod-handling technique is the best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it? Surprised, I bet! 
How I handle my fishing rod has nothing to do with battling... 
The two loves of my life are fishing and battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big fish or win a big battle. 
I was born to fish and battle! 
I come here on a ship. Big ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like. Very nice place. 
You want go to sea? My ship, we will see wonderful things. 
Huh? You’re my opponent? This is kind of unnerving...
I’m surprised... I didn’t think I’d win. 
See, I told you... I thought you were tough. 
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming! 
Thanks for your time! 
Let’s be good sports about this! Big smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha! Come on, you laugh, too! 
I’m cheerful even in defeat! Ahaha! Ahaha! 
Buck up.
Not bad. 
You’re good. 
The sweetest thing about battling? The finishing blow!
Take that! That’s my finishing move! 
Oof... I feel your final shots... 
Hey, you’re looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right? 
Hey, you’re kind of tough. 
Listen! This is my chorus group. Me and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop! 
Oh, wait! We’re not done singing! 
I got tips from my online friends on how to best raise my troop.
I must thank my online friends. I don’t know who they are, though. 
Well, this blows! My online buddies let me down! 
Can I have a moment? I’m trying to write some email.
I need to get home quick and check on my email. 
What do you think you’re doing? I want to go already. 
Father... Mother... Please watch over me...
Father... Mother... Were you watching...? 
Father... Mother... Please forgive me... 
Can’t rightly say I much like battling, I tell you.
I won, but... I’m still shaking... 
Grr... I’m so angry I could cry... 
It’s the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed? That’s the power of science! 
It’s inconceivable... How could the power of science be defeated? 
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the fruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory! I’ll get my professorship now! 
What kind of experiments? That’s classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for this battle.
Googoo gagga. 
Gagga... 
Fwahahaha! You’ve come a long way!
Fwahahahaha! 
Fwahahaha! You’re blessed to have your friends! 
I’ll scrap you.
I’ll recycle you. 
Think ecology. Think green. 
Why, sure! Sounds great! We have to do this!
Bam! All done! 
A battle while working... It’s a good way to take a break. 
I’ll try to do my best! Please give me this chance!
I’ve done it! I’ve achieved my goal! 
I tried the best I could! Thank you for your encouragement! 
A battle is... It is a love letter written in sand.
Did you understand what I’m trying to say? I guess you wouldn’t. 
Did you understand what I’m trying to say? I guess you wouldn’t. 
Hello, you there! Yes, you! Hold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn’t be out now. Go home, and be quick about it. 
You shouldn’t mess with a police officer like that. 
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble... Wait for me... Sssnork... 
Mutter... Ehehe... Ssssnore... 
Let’s keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes! 
You’re quite the Trainer yourself! 
A battle isn’t something you can calculate.
What’d I tell you? You win when you win. 
What’d I say, huh? You lose when you lose. 
There’s lots in life that doesn’t go the way you want.
Yippee! Things went my way! 
See...? 
There’s nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion! 
Farewell! 
I wait for tough Trainers here, come rain or come shine.
Because of that, I’ve grown so very strong... 
Won’t a tough... No, forget that. I need a cool Trainer to come... 
This is for keeping the sun off.
I’m strong at battling, but I can’t take sunlight... 
I don’t want to roast my skin. 
Well... Those are rare Pokémon...
I’ve never caught those... Your Pokémon are different, all right. 
Oh, you’re a Trainer? You’re not a Pokémon? 
Ready?
Cool. 
Bye. 
Beat me? Try again in another ten years!
No spine! 
You’re tough! You inspire me! 
Smelling sweet scents makes me so drowsy...
...Yawn... Oh? Are we finished so soon? 
...Yawn... Oh, really? I lost? 
You’re sure you can handle me? I’m an ultrastellar talent.
Don’t feel bad! I’m an ultrastellar talent! 
You’re in the miracle-star class! 
I live only for battles. Only victories give me hope.
...Naturally. 
Who are you...? 
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
                                    
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again! 
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you... I can live with that. 
                                    
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again! 
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you... I can live with that.

===============================
And we’re off!
We did it, yeah! 
Uncle! 
My Pokémon are a cut apart from the usual. Maybe even two cuts!
Their cutting intensity and solid attack... Top class, yeah? 
Grr... Rendered harmless... 
The prince among shorts-wearing Youngsters, that is me!
I hope I lived up to my title of the prince among the shorts wearers. 
I can’t lose here! Not as the prince among the wearers of shorts! 
I can’t bear this tension. Would they be mad if I went home?
I did it! I won somehow! 
That’s gone past my limit! I need to be excused! 
I’m not very good at this, but please don’t hold back.
Oh, didn’t I say? You shouldn’t have held back. 
Fweh! I wish you would have held back a little bit! 
In romance, fashion, and Pokémon! Today’s girls want it all!
The greed of today’s girls knows no bounds! 
Did being greedy end up costing me everything? 
I’m thinking hard about why everyone likes battling so much.
Why does winning a battle make people happy? 
Why is losing a battle so downright infuriating? 
I’m trying to keep up with my Pokémon training and my own schooling.
I’d like to think I’ve struck the right balance of fun and education. 
This isn’t going to work? My grades are the best in class, but... 
I crammed hard for this. I can’t possibly fail!
Yes! I get the win! I’m glad I kept with this! 
It means I need to study at home some more. 
My Pokémon are my treasures. I’ll let you see them. Just you.
See? Cute and strong! Eheheheh. 
See? They’re cute even when losing. Eheheheh. 
I won’t lose ever! Please abide by my rule!
Thank you so much! I owe this win to you! 
I so did not want to lose... 
I can do this... I can shine here, too!
Yes! I won! I’m going to be a star! 
One day, I’m going to shine as the brightest star in the world! 
Don’t be shy. You can bring it any which way.
Yeah, I figured you’d be like this. Heh. 
W-well, sometimes I have to lose, just so I don’t crush everyone. Ahaha... 
My father’s wealthy. There’s nothing he can’t afford.
My father’s money bought my Pokémon. 
There are things that money can’t buy. I know that... 
Well, shall we? Time is money, and the meter is running.
Well, I’ll take my leave. Yet another fancy dinner date, you know. Adieu! 
It’s my loss, is it? So be it. I had to leave for a date anyway. 
Uphold the rules of etiquette and courtesy... That’s what a lady does.
If I couldn’t unwind this way, I would lose my ladylike composure. 
I wish I could be free like the bird Pokémon in the skies... 
If I were Honey, then you would be Gooey Mulch, I would think.
Do you see now? How different we are in level and class? 
How dare you! I won’t forget this humiliation ever! 
Partying, shopping, dining... Darling, I’ve grown bored of it all.
Excitement is so lacking in my life. What will send my heart racing? 
Only battling lifts me from this idle existence of boredom and apathy... 
I’m glad to make your acquaintance! May this friendship be fruitful!
Thank you very much! Thank you so very much! 
Thank you very much... ...Pah. 
The most natural Trainer is... Oh, why hide it? None other than me!
This is the natural outcome. It was inevitable! 
I was battling naturally, and ended up with the loss. 
Yes! Not a grown-up! Lucky me! I stand a chance!
Yup, battling another kid is a lot less scary. 
I get really nervous in front of grown-ups. 
It’s hard to keep the streak alive, but the battles are fun.
It’s more fun to win, of course! 
Even losing is fun. It’s the wonder of Pokémon! 
My daddy is a real mountain man. Does that make my mom a mountain woman?
Mountain woman sounds icky. Not for me, thank you! 
I’m their daughter. Is being a mountain woman my destiny? 
I have a packed lunch all ready, and of course I have some snacks.
My favorite Pokémon make winning so easy! 
Oh, no, no! I forgot to bring my favorite Pokémon! 
I frolic with my water Pokémon in a pool all the time.
It sure makes me happy winning with my Pokémon favorites. 
I’d love to swim in a pool full of water Pokémon. 
I promised Mommy I’ll practice swimming if I lose.
Yay! I won’t have to go to the pool with Mommy today! 
Aww, I lost. Now I’ll have to go to swimming practice today. 
I went and caught my Pokémon with my daddy.
I won, Daddy! Daddy, thank you! 
I wonder if Daddy will show me how to train my Pokémon next? 
I’m on the way home from the pool, but OK, I can battle.
I hope I can go home soon. I need some dry clothes! 
Ah-ah-atchoo! Aww... Atchoo! We lost... 
I’m the captain of a heroic vessel among the crashing waves of a storm!
Made it to shore with the ease of a real swashbuckler! 
That was a bigger crash than I wanted! 
I just now got back from my vacation.
The beach is a good place to show off. 
Ooh, my sunburn is itching. 
Hunh? A battle, is that it? Sure thing, sure thing.
Hey, you’re something special, huh? 
Yeah, thanks for your time. 
This is going out to all the ladies. Babes, I sing and battle for you!
My ladies, my babes, I won for you. Your love is my power, right? 
I lost, but my love for the babes can’t be beat...maybe. 
This is no guitar I have here. It’s traditional and Japanese.
It has only three strings. Can you tell what this is? 
My instrument is called a shamisen. 
We teen Idols have a secret code of conduct that’s strictly enforced.
For example, if an Idol wins, she has to squeal and jump around. 
If an Idol loses, she must never act angry. That’s a big no-no. 
Do the monster Meteor Mash! It’s my catchphrase!
My Meteor Mash goes to your heart! 
All Idols need a catchphrase, especially right after their debut. 
You’re ever so lucky to get the chance to battle with me.
You’re super lucky to even battle an Idol like me. Don’t you get it? 
Huh? Huh? Now, why did you win? You know I’m supposed to win! 
Krink... Krak... Heheheh. Let me limber up for this.
Hah! Weak, even for a joke! 
Gnnrrr... I have only myself to blame... 
Aren’t they pretty? Adorable? They’re my beloved Pokémon.
You worked so hard! I’ll give you a nice massage at home. 
What are you doing to my Pokémon?! What if you hurt them?! 
I come before you as a member of the Pokémon Fan Club! En garde!
Long live the Pokémon Fan Club! May it always be glorious! 
This is hardly a taste of what the Pokémon Fan Club can bring down... 
Fan Club Department Manager... I hereby accept your challenge.
Heheh... Honestly, you thought you stood a chance against the Fan Club? 
Gwah! I will be avenged... B-by the Division Manager... 
Raising Pokémon with love isn’t the same as coddling them. Don’t you see?
Ooh, you did it! Oh, I love you so! My luvly, wuvly Pokémon! 
How could you?! What if my Pokémon are injured?! 
On behalf of my village, I take on this challenge!
Thank you, everyone! Thank you for your vocal support! 
Fellow villagers, I’m sorry! My best wasn’t enough! 
Thank you for your patience. Here is the battle you’d ordered.
I trust you were satisfied? I feel shortchanged somewhat. 
I trust you were satisfied? I’ve had my fill. 
Work is fun, and Pokémon also. I am happy I come to this country.
Having fun I am! I hoping to live here forever. 
Oh, why you beat me? So mean! I want go home to my country. 
I’m cool, right? So, everywhere I work, they make me the maitre d’...
I’m a good battler, too. I can’t help it that the ladies fall for me. 
I dream of evolving from a maitre d’ to a celebrity chef. 
There are no free deals on a battle. You’ll get the full course, though.
Where’s the fun if you don’t battle like you mean it? 
I take work and play seriously. That’s what sparks my passion! 
Hi, may I interest you in a meal combo? ...I’m so used to saying that at work!
Thank you, and have a great day! ...What am I saying? 
We look forward to your next visit! ...What am I thinking? 
Your team looks impressive. Will I be OK...?
Oh, what? Are those Pokémon only for Contests? 
Ouch! I said ouch! It was too much! Way, way too much! 
I love bug Pokémon! I love my bug net even more!
I caught my Pokémon using my trusty bug net. 
It’d be cool if there was a bug net Pokémon. 
The bugs are my minions, and I’m the boss. Are you prepared to lose?
Wahaha! Well done, my minions! 
We were mowed down... My minions have learned the hard way! 
I’m breaking out of my shell! I’m taking it to the next level!
It’s like I’ve sprouted wings! Viva to the new me! 
Is it not my time yet? Do I need to stay in my shell longer? 
You transgressor! Hold still, I say!
I willed myself to victory! 
C-curses... I’ve brought dishonor on us... 
Hey, hey, what’s that over there? It’s... It’s a legendary Pokémon!
Kekeke... Ninjutsu misdirection! It worked to perfection! 
Ninjutsu misdirection was a failure! I’ll disappear in a puff of smoke! 
You’ll be befuddled by my dazzling speed!
Your movements... It’s as if you’re moving in molasses. 
I didn’t need to do all that dashing around, did I? 
I’ve been wearing these clothes for a long time. Bathing is for the birds!
Changing clothes takes too much effort. Taking a bath is even worse! 
No, no, no! I won’t take a bath! 
I like my mommy, PIKACHU, and my daddy, too.
A weak Trainer isn’t cool. I don’t like you. 
A not-wimpy Trainer is cool. I like you. 
Pikapika pikaah! Pikka! Pikachuuuh!
Piika pikapikka! Pikka pikkachuuh! 
Pikka ppi pi piii... 
When I enter battle, I picture the vast sea in my mind.
When I can envision the sea, I feel as if I could never lose. 
When I envision the sea, I don’t feel the sting of defeat. 
In battle and in love, one needs to know when it is best to back off.
After all, both battle and romance can become quagmires of despair. 
I may have lost, but I said something deep, in an endless bog kind of way. 
I’m afraid I got cursed on our last exploration of ancient ruins. Ehehe.
Even just now, I have no idea how I won. Heeheehee. 
I may be cursed, but this is fun. It is all so very good. Heeheehee. 
Seeing buildings and towns from the old ages sends my pulse racing.
People interested in old architecture are potential Ruin Maniacs.
Open your eyes in towns. There will be exciting new discoveries. I mean it.
I put this team together with my Internet buddies. It took us all day!
We won! I need to thank my Internet buddies for their advice! 
Aww, darn it! We lost?! I’ll report it to my Internet buddies! 
I’m the main character of this story. It’s impossible for me to lose.
You’re good! Though, as a supporting character, you’re a bit too strong. 
...The hero has to suffer a bit so the audience feels more empathy. 
I’m very fickle. I can’t stick with any one thing for very long.
I won, and it’s enough for me. I’m going to check out the Wi-Fi Plaza. 
I lost, so that’s enough. I’ll go to the Safari Zone. 
I have a ton more experience than you. What will you do about it?
Not bad, but you need more maturing. 
Experience alone doesn’t ensure any wins, I’m learning. 
Don’t you think Pokémon battles are a lot like the weather?
Winning makes me feel warm and cheerful like a sunny day. 
Losing makes me sad like a dreary, cloudy day. 
I was out all night at a party again. I’m feeling dizzy from playing games!
I’m so bored of fancy parties and silly games, too. 
Urp...! 
Ooh, aren’t you the most darling thing! Can you win a smile from me?
Ooh, sweetie, I win, so no smile! Be sure to win next time! 
I don’t feel like smiling now...but I’ll be happy to wave good-bye! 
...Oh, wait one second. I have to take this call.
Hi, yup... Yeah, battling... Uh-huh... Yup, I won... Well, duh... LOL... 
Hi, yup... Yes, just battled... Nope... Kid beat me... Uh-huh... 
Snivel! Hnurrff! Snort! This hay fever is a wicked misery...
Hnurrff! Snivel! Snivel! Snivel! I won, but the misery continues! 
Sniffle. Snivel. Snort. I’m not crying. My nose is running. 
My acute sense of smell tells me how tough a Trainer is.
Keep trying. My nose tells me you have great potential. 
Sniff, sniff... Snort! My nose tells me you’ve been working hard! 
Kyahaha! I smell a powerful battle in the making!
The sweet smell of success! 
Defeat smells like a SKUNTANK! 
I like hard, fast beats in my battling and my rock ’n’ roll! Let’s wail!
And, bam! That rhythm pattern ruled, if I may say so myself! 
Ouch! That’s an insult to the ears! Those beats were offensive, man! 
To show you how much this means to me, I’ll use sound effects from now on.
Raaaah! Dun dun! Dun dun! Oompa-oompa-oompapa! 
Blip-bip, blip-bip... Blip... Bweeee... 
Wait, please wait... The winds... I hear them...
I can hear them... The winds are laughing... 
I can hear them... The winds... They are in tears... 
I can’t fly... But these babies can soar...
My spirit has been uplifted to the skies... Thank you, everyone... 
You broke my wings... I won’t ever forget you... 
Every day, I’m like a migratory bird, but I go in all cardinal directions.
I gained experience while traveling to all sorts of places. 
I’d love to live somewhere where I can find other Trainers like you. 
I was born unto rolling waves that washed me, with the beach, my cradle.
I was born and grew up on the seas. That’s what made me the big man I am. 
I lost, did I? Time to go to the sea and stare inscrutably at it.
Youths of today aim for the world! How’s that for deep!
There’d be some mighty cool Trainers around the world. I’m sure of that. 
Go on, kid! Take on the world! I’ll look forward to your return! 
What’s that? I smell dusty? Don’t you know the aroma of soil?
See, that’s what you get! Your team had to eat dirt, get it? 
Dropped in the dirt by some kid who doesn’t know the smell of soil! 
Sorry for looking so scruffy and dirty. I’ve been holed up in the mountains.
I wasn’t really holed up, at least not on purpose. I was lost out there. 
It’s better to be holed up in the mountains than in your room, I say. 
I’m not supposed to be here. Can we do this on the sly?
Even battling can draw attention. It’s not easy being a pop star. 
Pop stars are ordinary girls at heart. We want to enjoy our Pokémon, too! 
I’m a self-made celebrity. Do you have a problem with that?
A celebrity is a celebrity, even if it’s in my own mind. 
I want to be the center of attention, just me and only me. 
I’m facing retirement soon... I was never admired as an Idol.
I’m going to shine as a star battler of Pokémon! 
I would have liked to end my career with a win in this match...
I think training Pokémon shares a lot of similarities with a marathon. You agree?
There’s meaning in sticking with your training regimen every day. 
If you don’t pace yourself, you can’t win. 
Howdy! Let’s keep it clean, fair, refreshing, and pleasant!
Whew, I feel invigorated! Pokémon are the greatest! 
Uh, haha...ha... It actually feels kinda cleansing to be thrashed this badly. 
It’s the Workers of the world like us who keep the world going.
There are times we would like to lay down our tools and rest. 
Don’t forget how Workers like us work for you. 
My wife and boy are waiting on me back home. I can’t afford to lose!
I’m sorry, but I had to do this. You’ll get tougher with a family behind you. 
Oh, no! How am I supposed to show my face around my dear wife and boy now? 
Pokémon are like family to me. ...Nah, they are family.
Yes! My family, you did it! We knocked off that mean Trainer! 
Fwaaaah! That’s cruel! My family’s hurting! 
I was too lenient with my Pokémon. They grew up all selfish on me.
Hey, now, enough. Stop attacking! The battle’s long over already. 
Hey, now, the battle’s over and done. No attacking the Trainer. 
You, there. Don’t look around now. Pay attention to me. Focus.
Kid, you’re grossly underpowered. You ought to train with me. 
Oh, yeah. You’re better than you look. I was wrong about you, kid. 
Go, my Pokémon. But don’t strain yourselves.
Oh, wow, I like how tough everyone was. Our Pokémon and you, yup. 
OK, nice try, gang. Thanks much for trying. 
My papa’s dream... I’m going to make it real.
Papa, did you see? We did it all for you... 
We lost... Papa, I am so sorry... 
I’d like to take a break. ...No? We have to begin right away?
Aww, see? You should have taken a break with me before. 
Ooh, aren’t you a tough one? You should take breaks, though. 
Yes, yes, looking good! I need a smile now. Can you do that?
No, no, no. I need a smile from you. Let’s see those teeth sparkle! 
Yes, that’s a good smile! Now tilt your head toward me. 
You probably can’t tell, but I can see right down to your pores.
Yes, I see it, indeed. I can see you clearly. 
I zoomed in on you too much. I couldn’t see your Pokémon. 
While battling, I’ll keep looking for the best shot of you.
There! And there again! Decisive moments in time! 
Shots of me losing? Those get deleted immediately. 
I’ll be bringing you live coverage from my imminent battle!
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has carried the day! Go, me! 
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has gone down in defeat. Take pity on me! 
I hate admitting it, but I wanted to be an Idol, too.
I didn’t want to lose to any Idol. That motivated me to train. 
This is crushing... I work so much harder than any silly Idol... 
This microphone is what made me a star. It’s my all and everything.
Even for a battle, I don’t let this microphone leave my hand. 
...Thud. Bzzzzt... 
Hey, ’sup. I should warn you, I’m right fast, Trainer. Hold on to your hat.
Trainer, from now on, you can start adding Mister to my name. 
Trainer, that was a real learning experience. Thank you, seriously. 
This Bike has become an extension of my very being.
Any damage to my Bike, I feel the pain as if it were mine to bear. 
Please! I’ll ask you to keep your filthy hands off my Bike. 
When I was little, I hated cycling. I couldn’t get the hang of it.
I love cycling now. I’ve made many friends riding. 
Can you ride a Bike? It’s healthy and a lot of fun. 
I’ll ride toward the breaking dawn with you on my mind.
I will shift my gears higher and higher until I catch up to you... 
My tires have deflated, and so has my heart... 
Let the curtains rise on the festivities of muscles and Pokémon!
Did you enjoy our demonstration of muscles and Pokémon? 
Though I’ve lost, my muscles and Pokémon are seared into your mind. 
They say I have fists of steel and the heart of a child.
Oh, yay! Yippee! I won, I won! 
Oh, boo! Boo! This stinks! I’m not talking to you! 
Hwoaaah... Hwoaaah...
Howatchah! Howaaatchaah! 
Fweeeh... Fweeehhh... 
In my dictionary, there is no entry for “restraint.”
The greatest show of respect among Trainers is to battle all out. 
I went all out and still lost. Of course it stings. 
A professional martial artist is in perpetual control of his body.
A martial artist must be more than strong. He must also be wise. 
Gah! I overdid my training and ran out of stamina early... 
When I close my eyes, I can picture you being defeated. Come on.
Why be sad? You knew this was coming. 
I berate myself for my own lack of care... 
I don’t like to move much. I trained using the Net and TV.
Uhihi! I’m a naturally talented pro at both karate and Pokémon, I am. 
Oh, man, this is rotten! I’m tired and hungry and want to go home! 
...To get this far, I had to make sacrifices. Many, many sacrifices.
It’s for this one moment that I live. 
What else do I have to give up so I can beat you? 
First, let’s battle. Talking can wait.
That wasn’t bad at all, yup. That goes for you and your Pokémon. 
You’re a tough one, yup. Where do you do your training? 
Cute little Trainer! We’ll squash you flat.
Eheh! You’re so cute when you look angry and frustrated! 
What do you think you’re doing? I hate to lose, I’ll have you know! 
My precious Pokémon will set you right!
My Pokémon have no flaws that you can exploit! 
I apologize, my dear Pokémon... I was caught unprepared... 
Fwo-fwo-fwo. Youngster, what’s most important is to never give up.
If you give up, that’s it. The game’s over. 
Fwo-fwo-fwo. You’re an admirable Trainer already. 
I can tell by the way you look, you’re quite taken with my dandy style!
You shouldn’t be so mesmerized by me. Like a MOTHIM drawn to a flame! 
Oh, you’re not interested in me? You’re just SHELLOS, if I say so myself. 
Oh, hello, aren’t you a sweetie! Are you sure you’re up to this?
Oh, now, please don’t cry. You should be proud of yourself, dear. 
Oh, my... You’re quite the capable practitioner of the art. 
You and your Pokémon could use an obedience lesson from me.
This isn’t over until I say. Once more. 
You defy me? How very amusing. 
Over the years, I’ve crossed paths with many a Trainer.
They were all wonderful Trainers in their own way. All fond memories now... 
You’re one among those many Trainers. I’m sorry I wasn’t younger. 
I am a Psychic, though I may not look like one. I’ll do something psychic.
I didn’t use any psychic power to win. No, really. 
Did you notice? I was levitating while I was in battle with you. 
Fwazzam! So! You are my next victim!
Fwazzam! Have you no spine?! 
Fwizzle... Don’t think there will be a next time!
I can use psychic power, but I prefer ordinary sleight-of-hand magic tricks.
It’s my opinion that psychic power should be left to the Pokémon. 
I’m a Psychic, but I’m also a student of a magician’s school. 
In the next few minutes, you will learn true terror at my hands!
Hah! Too weak! Too weak! What pitiful resistance! 
Noooo! I cannot lose!
I see what I have no right seeing... Like there. Behind you.
Oh? You can’t see it? Then, you’re fortunate. Giggle... 
I wouldn’t ask about what I see. It’s better not to know. Really. 
The great unseeable power... I beseech you for help...
Oh, great unseeable power... I thank you for coming to my aid... 
Oh... Great unseeable power... Why have you forsaken me... 
Why do I raise Pokémon? Because they are there!
I think I said something deep and cool! Didn’t I? 
That’s no reason at all? That’s the reason in itself! 
My team has been raised with care. I have absolute confidence in them.
You should pay closer attention to the unique aspects of your Pokémon. 
How did you find my Pokémon? Did you notice their significance? 
Everyone, it’s showtime! Get out and do some clobbering!
Oh, bravo! Nicely won! 
Arrgh! How humiliating! Quick! Out of the spotlight! 
I love raising Pokémon. It’s what I live for!
Seeing them try so hard to please... It’s so unbearably adorable. 
Don’t you dare do that again! 
I’ve been devising ways of raising tough Pokémon from the genetic level.
You can’t overlook the role of knowledge in raising tough Pokémon. 
I need to study and understand what genetics is about first. 
Raise them with love, and Pokémon will answer in kind. Probably.
They responded to my love. Probably. 
You’re raising your Pokémon with a lot of love. I think. 
I believe I will approach this battle from the perspective of a newborn.
Abuboo dah. 
Ababaa. Manmaa. 
If you prevail, I’ll recount to you a tale from my youth.
Seeing you brings back a flood of memories. Ah, yes, indeed... 
...Hm? I seem to have forgotten... 
There’s no end to either adolescence or Pokémon.
See ya! That was fun! Enjoy your youth! 
I’m still a dreamer. A precious, unspoiled snowflake... 
Daddy... Mommy... Can you hear me? Please watch over me...
Daddy... Mommy... Did you see? I won, and it’s all for you... 
Oh... Daddy... Mommy... I couldn’t win... 
Finally... The time has come to put the fruits of my research to the test...
Success... Sacrificing my youth was worthwhile. 
No! Nooooooo! Give me back my youth! 
I developed a special Pokémon drink. Have some! Bottoms up!
Glug, glug... Belch! It’ll make you strong! Don’t waste it! 
My Pokémon drink contains no actual Pokémon or their byproducts. 
An analogy for battling is... I’d say a bachelor guy.
Heheh, do you get it? I doubt you’d get it. No one does. 
Do you get what I’m saying? I doubt you’d get it. No one ever does. 
Myself, I have been born, raised, and spent my life under a circus tent.
My Pokémon, too. They were born and raised under a circus tent. 
The outside world is so very cruel... We shall return to our circus tent.
Oi, you! Yeah, you! Snap to it! I’ll be training you!
What?! You’re down and out already?! This is no bed! Get up! 
Good! Enough! That will do for today! 
Fwah? You mean to challenge me?
Fwahaha! I win! Better luck next time, punk! 
Fwaah?! You defeated me? Who are you to do that?! 
Ooh, it gives me shivers... I live for this moment.
Oh, yeah... That’s it... Perfection doesn’t come better... 
It’s gotten so I can’t live without battling anymore. 
OK! I’m going to do it! I’m going to show you my best!
Gasp, gasp... 
Never again! You can forget about a next time! 
Um... I’m honestly quite tough. Please keep up.
I’m sorry. I don’t think you measure up after all. 
I’m amazed. I didn’t think you’d win... 
Let’s go, me! Go, me, go! Don’t lose, don’t lose, rah, rah, rah!
Way to go, me! I’m so wonderful! Rah, rah, rah! Gooooooo, me! 
It’s OK, me! Don’t cry! Don’t cry! Go home, go home, goooooo! 
Woohoo! Here comes a cool Trainer! Let’s see what you can bring!
Yes! Bravo! You have some good attacks, Trainer! 
Whaaaaat?! Nooooo! I can’t get over how tough you are! 
To serve and protect Pokémon and nature. That’s my mission!
My skills I developed in the embrace of Mother Nature! 
My mission needs me! This is where we bid good-bye! 
Never fear, this Pokémon Ranger is here to protect my own personal peace!
My personal peace has been protected! 
You vile Trainer, you! You’ve shattered my peace! 
Any bad kids littering the fields? Any bad kids fouling the sea?
Be sure to sort your recyclables from the trash when you’re throwing it out!
Trash is like a battle. Don’t be too quick to throw it!
Watch me, darling! I’m putting my best into this!
See, darling? Did you see? I put in my best effort for you. 
I can’t have my darling see me like this. How pathetic I must look... 
So, I lead with this... Then, counter... Ugh, I can’t get our strategy right!
To overanalyze can be a bad thing, I guess. 
Waaah! Couldn’t you have waited? Until I’m ready at least? 
How do you like my cape? I had it specially made!
What is my cape made of? I’m afraid I can’t tell you. 
Rip... Riiiiiiiiiiiipppppp! ...What?! My cape! Waaaaah! 
Do you know what real terror is? I am familiar with it. Intimately so...
You learned something today, yes? The true meaning of terror. 
Aiyeeh! What’s with you? I’m pleading for mercy here! 
See it! Hear it! Smell it! Marvel at my power!
That’s right! Use all your senses and realize what you were up against! 
I didn’t see anything! I’m not listening! And I don’t smell a thing! 
Unluckily for you, your winning streak ends with me.
You lost to me, but you’re still on your feet. Kudos to you! 
This can’t be. I won’t accept it. There has to be a mistake somewhere. 
I c-c-can’t stop shivering. B-but this is a b-battle. I have to.
Urrff... Ch-chatter... I won, I won... 
Sh-shiver... Urf... My eyelids are getting droopy... 
I’ll say good-bye to you now. Battles always end in tears.
Fweeeeh! My tears of joy flow freely! 
Fweeeeh! My tears of anguish flow freely! 
How amusing! You came here knowing of your certain defeat?
Ahahahah! Very entertaining! I shall be happy to see you again! 
Wh-what is happening...? M-my vision is turning milky white... 
A Trainer am I, a new ray of hope from the land of the midnight sun.
In the frigid falls of the north, I honed my skills. With them, I made you fall. 
Your foul trickery deserves contempt. But effective it was, too. 
I’ve been pondering lately... How much longer will I be wearing shorts?
Will I still be in shorts as a grown-up? 
If I grow old like this, will they call me something silly like “Shorts Man”? 
That’s right, I’m the legendary kid in shorts who’s the talk of the town.
Even a Youngster in shorts like me can be the stuff of a legend or two. 
My legend is over... 
Uh... Um... H-hello. P-pleased to meet you.
S-s-sorry. I’m r-really n-nervous. 
Uh... Th-thank you. That was f-fun. 
Oh, this place is so passé now. I’m missing out on shopping.
You’re kind of stylish, actually. Oh, I wish I had new clothes. 
Maybe I’ll collect Accessories for some Contests... 
Exam season’s coming up, but I’m neck-deep in battling...
Mom’s going to cut me off. I just know it... 
I have to keep up on both my studying and Pokémon... 
Hiya, you Trainer there! Slip on some glasses. They’ll make you look better.
Nothing’s the matter with my eyes. I wear glasses for the looks I get. 
Whoops! My glasses, my glasses. 
I’ve been taught every opponent has a weakness. If I can find yours...
Eheheh. I figured out your weakness. 
Did you figure out my weakness? 
It’s been so long since I had my last battle.
You know, battling is fun after all. 
Battling is so much fun, but... 
The age of money has come to Pokémon battling. I’ll teach you who is right.
You understand, don’t you? What is right, and who is stronger? 
M-my Pokémon! What have you done? What am I to do?! 
You’re my opponent? Oh, all right... Try not to disappoint me too badly.
My Pokémon are all tops in luxury. Do you see? This is what power is about. 
Nyah! I don’t care! I’ve got enough  money to fill a swimming pool! 
You there. Yes, you. I’m feeling rather bored.
I suppose that was enjoyable for what it was. I thank you for it. 
You are rather good. Quite remarkable, even. 
I can sink your sort with minimal effort.
It took the barest of efforts to win this match. 
You swamped us with no effort at all... 
My room is always full of bugs. That drives my mom just wild.
I want to collect more bug Pokémon for my bug appreciation station. 
Bugs are loose under my shirt. I’m starting to itch... 
People claim I’m like an adult. Whatever could they mean, do you suppose?
Ah, yes, quite enjoyable! We must do this again, surely. 
Oh, yes! Smashing! That chilled me to my toes, it did! 
I have made my choice. When I fall, it shall be forward!
You lack conviction. 
...Thud. 
So, what exactly is a ninja, you may ask.
A ninja is powerful. That will do as a start. 
Maybe some ninjas are weak? 
I once saw a lady wearing the same outfit as me.
She said, “You’re showing serious fashion chops.” 
She said, “You’re kidding me, am I right?” 
Will you believe that inside this costume is a grown-up Beauty?
My dream is to live as a Pokémon one day. To become a Pokémon! 
I’m an adult, but I want to be a Pokémon. Does that make me weird? 
My profile’s riding high now, so my schedule’s filled solid!
Oh, no! It’s this late already? I’d better check my timetable! 
Talent manager! Do I have time for a rematch? 
Are you another of my fans? I can give you an autograph if you’d lose?
Here’s your autograph! Cherish it! Oh, sorry! I don’t do handshakes. 
I’m sorry, I was acting GASTLY! It was very DELCATTY of me! 
I need to diet. I have to get out jogging.
Well, I guess I’ll go for a quick trot around here... 
Your Pokémon know how to punch hard. You see, I’m really a boxer. 
I look to bug Pokémon for hints on running all the time.
I admire the light and agile footwork of bug Pokémon. 
Skitter... 
Listen, I’m feeling bushed today. Can we do this tomorrow first thing?
Oh, all right. You’re impatient. Couldn’t wait till tomorrow, oh no. 
That’s why I said tomorrow. I can barely stay awake now. 
Feed the Pokémon you catch, or they will flee. Do you see?
Once a Pokémon has fled, it will never return. Do you see? 
What I said about Pokémon--it is a parable. Do you see? 
When I was younger, I went out on digs chasing rumors of hidden treasures.
Of course, there are no such things. But it’s about chasing a dream. 
Well, it sure left huge holes... In the ground and in my bank account. 
I’ll launch an avalanche of moves! I’ll test your limits of endurance!
Well, Trainer? Should I try out some more moves? 
That’s it! I’m all out of stock! I’d like you to leave so I can close up! 
I collect and battle Pokémon so I can brag to my peers.
I’m not all that interested in winning or losing to begin with. 
You’ve won the battle. But, in terms of the Pokémon involved, I clearly win.
Did you want to see my Pokémon? OK, sure. Just a peek, though.
How’s that for classy? My Pokémon are tops in both moves and character. 
Hold it right there! You can look, but don’t touch! 
Rock? Samba? Traditional folk? I can play in any style. It’s all good!
Music and Pokémon uplift me! I’m carried up among the stars! 
Sigh... I’m seeing stars... You’ve got me singing the blues... 
Let my exquisite melody ring out! Hear my Pokémon shout out!
The melody from my Pokémon and me... Did it reach out and touch your heart? 
I’ve been known to throw matches, but I’ll never throw a guitar on stage! 
I’m free like a bird! I feel like I could fly!
That’s how I ended up becoming a Bird Keeper. 
Like most birds, I can’t see very well at night. 
As a Trainer, I’m as fragile as an egg. Please be gentle on me.
Do you think I’m getting ready to take flight? 
One of these days, I’ll break out of my shell and defeat you. 
Bear witness to my display of machismo and masculinity!
There! That’s how a real man lives and battles! 
Waaaah! Waaaah! Mommy! 
I’ve got a showdown coming up with a Hiker. Let me see if I’m ready!
Yep, I’d say my team’s about ready. That Hiker won’t know what hit him! 
Aww, blast it, no! I can’t beat that Hiker like this! 
My showdown against a man of the sea draws near! Let me test my team!
Everything went as calculated... Be ready for me, man of the sea! 
Beating the man of the sea is impossible with an outcome this lame... 
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi! This dance I use to psych myself up.
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi! So much fun, I cannot stop. 
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi! I dance to stem my tears from losing... 
I’m not really with the police. I’m a collector of uniforms.
Battling as a Policeman made for a very fun battle, it did. 
That’s it for me. I bid you a fond farewell. 
I’m a Policeman. But on holidays, I’m an entirely different kind of guy.
Usually, I chase after bad guys as a Policeman. 
On my days off, I chase after the waves and the ladies as a Swimmer. 
Perseverance pays off. A case can turn on that.
It makes for more excitement when you come from behind to take the win. 
That was more thrilling than any stakeout! Thanks for that! 
My present case can go either way. It’s a coin toss.
So, I won this time... All decided by a fickle coin... 
Best two out of three? 
I live in the woods. You know, I’m a Camper.
I’m working on making camp life more comfortable. 
I am sick and tired of camping out in the woods... 
No, no, I can’t do this! I’m not cut out for battling!
Oh, wow! I won! What’ll I do? You’re not mad at me, are you? 
See! I told you before we started! Battling just isn’t for me. 
Trainer spotted! It’s time to get cooking!
A battle should be enjoyed like a tasty meal! 
I ended up getting cooked! 
Fweeoo-fwee-fwee-fyoo... I saunter into battle, whistling...
Too easy! I was whistling all the way through that. 
Fwee-ooo fwee-ooo fwee-ooo... I switched to an ambulance siren... 
I can hear it... The screaming adulation of 100,000 fans rising in unison...
Right on, everyone! You saw that! I dedicate my win to you! 
You’re scorching... You’ve made a fan out of me. 
Number one worldwide, that’s my dream. Well, to start, anyway.
“Number one worldwide,” now doesn’t that have a good ring to it? 
I can’t quite decide what I should be number one worldwide at. 
I’m not some cheap Idol! I’m an actress! Please remember that!
My career isn’t anything like your typical Idol’s career! 
I’m an actress... It sounds so deliciously right... 
We’re not here for a long time, so let’s make it a good time!
Thank you! That was soooo fun! I really hope we can battle again! 
It makes me sad having to say good-bye... Please come see me again! 
I am the Fan Club Division Manager... Bring your best to bear...
Kneel before the might of the Fan Club! 
Gweh! But I did my best! Regrets, I have none! 
I welcome you, young Trainer. Allow me to demonstrate my power.
Young Trainer, do you have any idea what my power signifies? 
You’ve surpassed me in your love of Pokémon. You’re the truest of fans. 
I think I’ll try out the TM the woman next door gave me.
I am impressed. That woman actually gave me something useful. 
Oh, that nasty woman! This TM is worthless! 
I heard that! I may be old enough to be your mom, but I’m still young!
Look at my skin tone and my Pokémon! Both firm but supple! 
Please don’t make that mistake again! I’m young, I tell you! 
Whether it be work or play, I’m with my Pokémon all day.
Life without Pokémon? I can’t picture that. 
It’s like I’m married to my Pokémon. I’m not married, though. 
You get to be the best by working harder than everyone else.
I reckon I’ve been a hard worker. 
Work at battling over and over. Your star will shine one day. 
I’m going to become famous here so I can rebuild the ranch.
I can’t lose. It’s for my pa and ma. 
If I can get famous, folks’ll pay to visit my ranch... 
From sundown, I live by candlelight until I go to sleep.
That’s not to say I don’t have electric power on the homestead. 
Candlelight can be very romantic. 
I’d like to introduce you to my cherished partners.
Good, good. Good going, gang. You guys all did great. 
Wheeze... Wheeze... I’m feeling faint... 
I’m no green thumb at growing Berries. Raising Pokémon is where I shine.
I can give you tips on raising Pokémon so they’ll grow tough. 
Raising a living thing is never an easy job... 
Pokémon are Pokémon, no matter how tough, weak, cute, or scary.
Raise Pokémon with love, and they’ll return it. 
I think it’s the Trainer who needs to pick up the pace here. 
Raising a Pokémon right takes money and time.
But it’s all worthwhile when the Pokémon grows up. 
To raise the ideal Pokémon, I’m willing to work hard. 
That’s right, I’m tough. I won’t lose. I don’t think losing’s possible.
Yup, I’m so tough... Ehehe... Heeheehee... 
I lost? But, how...? What now? What do I do? 
I’m an Ace Trainer, so this is for bragging rights.
Yup, you did good. No, seriously. 
Heh... I’ve got a long ways to go... 
I was looking forward to a battle with you!
I was right! You are pretty decent. Why not become an Ace Trainer? 
You’re as good as the rumors say... May I have a rematch one day? 
Look at me. I’m what you should be aspiring to be.
You expected anything else? 
You’ve already surpassed me. But you can aim so much higher. 
My whole life hinges on this one battle! ...Lose for me, pretty please?
Yeah! I won! It’s all smooth sailing for me now! 
I wasn’t supposed to lose... That’s my life derailed... 
I’m running a fever here. Just so’s you know.
Oogh, my head’s burning up. It makes me feel more inspired. 
Like I said, I have a cold. I’m not on top of my game. 
When we battle, I want you to be very careful. My coat’s very expensive.
Yikes! Eek! Watch out! You almost got Pokémon sweat on my coat! 
I was worried about getting my coat dirty. Who cares about your battle? 
I wish you’d leave. I don’t want to see you lose.
I told you so... Can you leave, please? 
Listen...is being tough not always a good thing? 
Whoa-whoa-whoa... Careful now! Maintaining balance is the key!
Whoops...! Almost went over! Have to be careful here... 
...Waaaaaah... Thud! 
Now don’t you worry about a thing. You leave everything to me, OK?
What do you say? Fun, hey? It’d be nice if we could meet again. 
Well, I’ll be! You sure got the best of me! 
I will battle. It’s not likely I will lose. I’m tough.
I win. I could do a dance right now. 
What is the matter? Why couldn’t I win? 
Mother Nature, I beseech you! Please, lend me strength!
Oh, Mother Nature, I thank you! To you, I dedicate this victory! 
I’m sorry, Mother Nature! I’m sorry to disappoint you! 
A good Trainer takes on all challenges regardless of the foe or the rules.
No Trainer can be considered bad if they battle the best they can. 
A good Trainer doesn’t gloat over a win. They just prepare for the next battle. 
Come hither, my Pokémon! Please get rid of this mean Trainer!
Ooh, yes, I love you, my sweeties! Come here and give me a kiss!
How could you?! You hurt my sweet little ones! 
I’m fine with practice and training, but I wilt when the chips are down.
I feel sick from tension! I’d rather be at home practicing! 
If it’s about practice, I’d be the champ without a doubt. 
Hi-yah! Hah! Hah! One more! Hah! Hah!
Boo-yah! 
Hi-yah! ...No, wait! No! 
Wanna?
Heh... 
You beat me? Where’s your dojo? 
Come oooon! C’mon, c’mon! Hey! Hey! C’mon, hey!
Oh, yesssss! 
Oh, noooooo! 
Your eyes are unclouded by doubt. This match will be entertaining...
From the bottom of my heart, I look forward to your return. 
Whew... A most entertaining match. I hope you’ll grant me a rematch. 
You need to be taught what wisdom of age means in battle!
I’ll have you know that no child can hope to defeat me! 
That did not happen! Unfair! I demand a rematch right now! 
I’m feeling cranky today! Help me get my mind off it!
Whew... A battle is the perfect stress reliever! 
Eeeeeeeeh! You’ve pushed me over to furious! 
Cue battle music, please! I want to trumpet my victory!
I love the battle music. It sets my heart racing. 
Fine, that will do. Back to the regular theme music. 
When you’ve been a Trainer as long as I have, let’s just say you’ll see a lot.
Things like this happen. Don’t let it get you down. 
People and Pokémon are all different. Isn’t that what makes it beautiful?
My big brother told me to go for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!
I did it, big brother! 
My big brother told me to wreck the other Trainer’s accuracy! 
I hear my Pokémon calling out... They clamor to battle...
I hear my Pokémon calling out... They call for your return... 
I hear my Pokémon calling out... They tell me of the fun they had... 
Behind you, I see light. What is its significance?
I thought I saw an aura of invincibility. I must have been mistaken. 
Now I see... You glow with the light of victory... 
I’ll deliver defeat to you elegantly and speedily.
Thank you for your patience! 
I’m so terribly sorry. I ended up with your intended defeat. 
Great, another tough-looking Trainer. The fun never ends for me.
Bleah, that was too close for comfort. Nothing ever comes easy for me. 
Yeah, see? I knew I’d lose. If only that move landed... 
Everyone has too much to say about Pokémon! If it’s fun, that’s enough!
Excuse me, but are you all right? Maybe you’re a little too tired? 
If you get too caught up in winning and losing, you’ll burn yourself out. 
Aren’t you the cutest guest! You can expect the best service from me!
Well, were you impressed by the level of service I provided? 
Oh, wait, please! I’m not done serving you! 
I keep a journal about the lives of the Trainers who arrive here.
In our vast world, I wonder how many Trainers will cross my path? 
Every encounter ends in parting. That’s why I keep a journal. 
I’ve waited all my life for someone like you. I’m never letting you go.
It was a ploy to confuse you with words out of some romance movie. 
Now, go on, don’t let me hold you back. Seize your chance at happiness! 
Will you give me an interview if you win?
You made my job too easy. You need to buckle down. 
Your feelings now, in a word! Shout it into the mike, please! 
I’m on a diet... I’m so famished...
I’m happy, but if I get excited, I’ll get hungry. No thanks... 
Oh... Your Pokémon look delicious... 
Let me make it clear right now, I’m tougher than you can stand!
See? I wasn’t exaggerating! 
Who are you exactly?! 
Clear the way! Out of the way! Wait! Don’t go! We have to battle!
Come on, take it up a gear! Keep up with me! 
OK, out of the way! Clear the way! Let this loser run away! 
Safe driving and safer battling. That’s my motto.
You can be patient in a battle. Victory will come eventually. 
I’ll keep to my own pace. I’ll catch up to you one day. 
I only have this Bike to look good for the guys. I can’t actually ride.
It was a pain getting this Bike here. I had to push it all the way! 
I’m only concerned about looking good. I don’t practice enough. 
I’m not looking for any excitement. I don’t need any drama.
A battle is all the excitement I need. 
I recently realized that I’m not cut out for this scary job. 
I’ll battle my way. You battle yours.
People are people. I’ll go my own way. 
People are people. You go your own way. 
Today, I have a special treat for all my fans!
Thank you! I love your support! 
Are you really one of my fans? 
I’m burnt out on being an Idol. I want to go home to the country...
I can’t quit now! Kids dream of being me! 
I miss hearing my mother’s voice... 
I’m one of a kind. That’s what I’m saying.
I keep it real. That’s what makes me tough. 
I kept it real, but you won anyway. Your reality was more real. 
Hi! Are you my next opponent? Let’s keep it clean and fair!
It feels great going all out with no dirty tricks. 
That was an awesome workout! We have to do this again sometime! 
My needs are simple. Fishing and Moomoo Milk are all I need.
Winning or losing isn’t something I pay heed to. 
I could use some Moomoo Milk right about now. 
You there! Take a look at the Pokémon I fished up the other day.
I can tell you’re impressed. This guy, I don’t know how long it took to land. 
A word of advice: when an older person is bragging, pretend to be interested. 
You’re a Trainer. Let your Pokémon do the talking.
Where’s your spirit? That didn’t speak to me at all. 
Great! Great! Your feelings came across! 
Here comes your prey! Get ’em! Chaaaarge!
Gaahahaha! That’s it! Good job! 
We’re outmatched! Pull back, guys! Run away! 
Bring it on! Ooooh! Haaah!
Thank you kindly! 
Thanks for having me! 
I am captivated by the mountains. They’re the main thing in my life!
The mountains mean more to me than any battle, no matter how fun! 
Your battle skills are impressive, but I can’t wait to return to the mountains. 
We’re going to hammer you, kid. Don’t freeze up and close your eyes.
I like how you stay defiant even after losing. Good attitude, kid. 
Honest, I didn’t let up one bit or let down my guard because you’re a kid. 
I battle around the globe. I’m a worldwide bad boy!
I don’t lose at battling. I can’t get over how cool I am! 
I’m hitting the road over that loss. It’s good-bye to the old me! 
Battles, I’m good at. But musical aptitude? Forget it.
This whole battling thing is good, but I wish I could play music as well. 
Music or Pokémon... It’s a tough choice. 
I wrote a song using the cries of Pokémon. I’d like you to hear it.
Graaah wagyaaah! Wagyaaaah! Chu! Chu! Gyaroooh-gah! 
Giiyaaaah! Drundundun! Garoo-gah! Wawawaaah! 
I’m bored of collecting and hoarding. I’m getting rid of everything now.
There’s nothing that I really want now. Maybe I’ll become a clown...
I threw the match for a start. It’s nice to be unburdened of things.
Oh! Hold on a second! Incoming text message!
Ticka-ticka-ticka... Ticka-tick... Huh? Is it over already? 
Hey, stop that! No peeking at my text messages! 
There’s no meaning to this battle! Pokémon should be about love!
Battling leaves me empty. Hug your Pokémon and show your love! 
Battling creates nothing. Hug your Pokémon and show your love! 
Are you challenging me? ...You are. Kids these days...
Now run along home, and go help your mommy with her chores! 
Hey, you... If you think playtime will last forever, you’ll end up like me. 
How will you counter my implacable logic?
Everything according to calculation... This victory is a complete one. 
You outcalculated me. I’m incredulous. 
I’ve been ensconced in the lab. My shoulders are all knotted up.
What a refreshing break! I’m feeling loose and relaxed now. 
My Pokémon and I, we all need to get outside and exercise more. 
Hmmm... So young... I may have to go easy...
You’re so depressingly young... It’s fine. You may go. 
Consider the loser’s feelings. That’s where you young people fail... 
You see an old man, yes? Don’t be fooled by the way I look.
I find it abhorrent to lose to any young Trainer. 
I was fooled by your youth. Foolish, foolish me... 
As a Worker, it’s my job to both build and demolish.
Why don’t you become a Worker, too? I find it fun and rewarding. 
Making things is harder than demolishing, but it’s more satisfying. 
You and your Pokémon, I’ll clean up on you easily.
Well, well, how pathetic was that. Take your passengers and go home. 
Gwaah... So heavy... My guys buckled under the load. 
Outstanding athleticism and a great sense of humor; that’s a clown!
A clown is a job of greatness. Only the chosen can become one! 
The ability to laugh off disappointment is another requirement for a clown! 
Laugh with the face and cry with the heart; that’s how a clown lives.
Ahahahahaha! 
Gah! ...Ahahahaha! 
Oi, listen! I’m a Policeman, sure, but a Trainer before that!
What? A Policeman can’t lose his temper? 
Yes, I’m a Policeman, but I have dreams and aspirations, and, and... Snivel... 
Hands up! Put ’em where I can see ’em! You’re all under arrest!
Case closed! 
This is a gross miscarriage of justice! 
I’ll have you know that I’m an Internet detective.
My powers of observation and logic prevailed! 
Think you’ve outsmarted me? Maybe this was just a sting operation! 
Wherever, whenever, and with whomever. That’s my motto!
When, where, or whom... It doesn’t matter at all to me. 
Hahaha! This is great! I want to keep this going! 
The loser has to pretend to be a STUNKY, OK?
Giggle, you lose. I want to see your STUNKY impression! 
OK, here’s my STUNKY impression! Three, two, one... 
A good breeze has sprung up... This is good! I can win this!
The tailwind put us over the top! ...As they say! 
The headwind worked against us! ...As they say! 
Even though I always have my parasol up, I actually like sunny days.
I hope it will be sunny tomorrow... 
The heavy downpour in my heart... When will it ever stop...? 
My, you’re very eager to go. I’d better take the tension up a notch, too!
I had a lot of fun with that match! Wouldn’t it be nice to see you again! 
You’re so full of energy! Why, I feel energized, too! 
How much longer do I have to wait for a Trainer that’s any good?
I’m so bored by the weak competition. Maybe I’ll just retire. 
Oh, hello, there. Now, you’re a little special. 
My ladylike charms don’t mean a thing to a little kid...
That was too close for comfort! It doesn’t pay to underestimate foes. 
Battling fair and square doesn’t appeal to me. I’d rather win. 
Like everything else, people have likes and dislikes when it comes to scents.
I love how Pokémon smell after a battle. 
I feel a little thrill if I catch a whiff of intense effort postbattle. 
Sniff, sniff... Yes! Here it comes! Aroma power!
With aroma power, I’m invincible! 
Fizzle... I’m out of aroma power... 
Turn, step, turn, turn... I’ll practice my dance steps while battling!
I dance with passion and precision. How can there be a weakness? 
You’re throwing off my rhythm! My dance routine is ruined! 
I’m always ready for the public eye. You can come at me at your own pace.
That’s why people consider me the perfect Idol. 
I didn’t know how bad it feels to lose. This is a first for me. 
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic! Do come again! 
I have no problem with losing to a spectacular Trainer like you! 
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic! Do come again! 
I have no problem with losing to a spectacular Trainer like you! 
What Pokémon do you want up on stage? I can’t wait!
That was a most enjoyable time! Thank you! Come again, please. 
Oh... I detest how fun times seem to end so quickly. 
What Pokémon do you want to show off this time? I can’t wait!
How wonderful that was! Thank you! Come again, please. 
It’s so sad how the truly fun times seem to last only a moment. 
It doesn’t matter what you throw at me. I’ll always win. My investigative and analytical system is truly amazing.
See? Just as analyzed. 
Whoa! You sure showed me! 
It doesn’t matter what you throw at me. I’ll always win. I’ll stake my investigative and analytical system on it!
See? Just as analyzed. 
Whoa! You sure showed me! 
Always be smiling! Luck comes to those who are happy! That’s why I always keep a big smile and believe in my Pokémon when I battle.
You’re very good! I had a lot of fun! 
You’re so very, very good! My Pokémon had a good time, too! 
Whenever I battle someone tough, I smile. I cannot help it! How about you? What do you do? Do you laugh? Cry? Get angry?
Win or lose, whenever I battle someone wonderful, I am happy! 
Battling a wonderful Trainer is always a happy occasion! 
Very well... Shall we begin?
Ah, a most valiant effort. Though I was lucky enough to win this time, the next time... 
My Pokémon could not be faulted in any way, shape, or form. My hat’s off to you. 
This is for Lady Caitlin’s sake. I’m afraid I must go all out.
Ah, a most valiant effort. Though I was lucky enough to win this time, the next time... 
Your skills are superlative as ever! My admiration knows no bounds.

...Humph! You’re doing OK for someone weak.

Say, you’ve got a lot of nerve, coming here... 
That’s ridiculous. There’s no way I could lose to a wimp like you! 
...Humph! Useless Pokémon! Listen, you. You won only because my Pokémon were weak. 
...Humph! I knew you were lying.

Out of desperation, weak people sometimes do OK at fighting back. 
Don’t you get that I’m going easy on you? 
...Humph! I’m not fighting with another weakling ever again. It’s just too much playing around.

Hey, hey! Why so serious? 
No way... 
...Why... Why do I lose? I’ve assembled the toughest Pokémon. I didn’t ease up on the gas. So why do I lose? 
Humph. This is my real power, wimp. I’ll make Team Rocket history. And I’m going to grind that Lance under my heels.

I see. Seems it wasn’t just luck that’s gotten you this far. 
Humph! You were too strong... 
...I couldn’t win... I gave it everything I had... What you possess, and what I lack... I’m beginning to understand what that Dragon Tamer said to me... 
...Humph! I knew it. Strength is everything. Nothing else matters.

I see. You weren’t coming to Kanto just to show off... 
I see you weren’t playing around, either... 
Humph! I guess it can’t be helped... 
Hmm, seems my Pokémon are pretty good.

Why?! I’ve still got one left! 
Do you think you’ve won already? 
... OK. I lost... 
... Whew... With my partners, I’m going to be the Champion!

I hate to admit it, but you win. 
All right! SUICUNE, were you watching us? 
The wind is finally with us! 
We can still fly! 
I understand... I’ll bow out gracefully. 
Even though it’s my last Pokémon, Bug Pokémon are tough! 
Hang in there! Just a little more! 
Aw, that’s the end of it... 
H-hey! Just one left? But... I ain’t losin’, you hear? 
Poor me! 
Ugh... 
No, it’s not over yet--not yet! I still believe we can do it! 
We’ve got more discipline than anyone else! 
How is this possible... 
Properly tempered steel won’t be made rusty by things like this! 
Steel will hang on to the very last! 
Well done... 
We haven’t lost yet! 
No... Not...yet... 
We...lost... 
Humph... You are quite the Trainer. 
Willow is my middle name. Willow is flexible and not easily broken. I’m not giving up yet. 
Hmm. Seems as if my luck has run out. 
One Pokémon left? This is where the real battle begins! 
You’re kidding, right? I’m supposed to win! I already decided! 
I lost? ... I don’t believe it. There must be some mistake...

Ho ho! You some kind of big shot? We’ll see what happens if you get pushed around up here. Think you’ll stagger and fall? People here are training night and day to become bird Pokémon masters. Bring it on! 
Gaaah! 
Falkner’s skills are for real! Don’t get cocky!
I can’t believe how ridiculously high this is! But from up here, you can tell what it feels like to be a bird Pokémon! Let me see if you’re good enough to face Falkner! 
This can’t be true! 
Even though you’re a rookie Trainer, you’re not bothered by these heights at all... You’re really something! 
Amy: Hey, are you challenging the Leader? No way! 
Amy: Oh, goodness!
Amy: You’re really strong!
Amy: You have only one Pokémon? That’s kind of lonely...
Mimi: If you insist, we’ll be your opponents. 
Mimi: I’m feeling a bit dizzy... 
Mimi: Our bug Pokémon lost! Oh, what a shame. 
Mimi: It’s a little unfair to battle someone who has only one Pokémon. 
Bug Pokémon evolve young. So they get stronger that much faster. 
Just evolving isn’t enough! 
If you want to meet the Gym Leader, you have to move the web using the switch. 
You’ve come all this way, crossing the web like a bug Pokémon! Allow me to teach you the charms of bug Pokémon! 
You proved how tough you are... 
Just being in this Gym, I feel like I’ve turned into a bug Pokémon! 
You saved all the SLOWPOKE? Whew, you’re mighty! But my grown-up Pokémon are pretty tough, too! 
Urrgggh! 
If you move the web with the switch, you’ll be able to figure out where the lift is going. 
You shouldn’t let your guard down just ’cause I don’t look tough! 
Gosh... I thought you were weak... 
Who do you think are stronger-- boys or girls? 
I like cute Pokémon better than strong Pokémon. But I have strong and cute Pokémon! 
Oh, no, no, no! 
I’m training really hard to try to beat Whitney, but I’m starting to get discouraged... What to do... Well... If I lose, I’ll just try harder next time! 
Oh, you are a cute little Trainer! I like you, but I won’t hold back! 
Let’s see... Oops, it’s over? 
Wow, you must be good to beat me! Keep it up! 
Give it your best shot, or I’ll take you down! 
No! Oh, MEOWTH, I’m so sorry! 
I taught MEOWTH moves for taking on any type... 
I shall win! 
I... I... I lost! 
The one who most wants to win--will! 
Not sure of your way? Defeat me if you want a hint! 
Wh-what? 
Having trouble finding your way around? The path is right before our eyes! 
I spent the spring with my Pokémon. Then summer, autumn, and winter... Then spring came again. We have lived together for a long time. 
Wins and losses--I experienced both. 
Where did Pokémon come from? 
Can you inflict any damage on our Pokémon? 
Ah! Well done! 
We use only Ghost-type Pokémon. No Normal-type attack can harm them! 
My Pokémon and I are bound together by friendship. Our bond will never be broken! 
This isn’t real! 
You seem to have a strong bond with your Pokémon, too! 
We martial artists fear nothing! 
That’s shocking! 
Fighting-type Pokémon are afraid of Psychic types... 
Words are useless. Let your fists do the talking! 
... 
I lost!  I’m speechless! 
My raging fists will shatter your Pokémon! 
I got shattered! 
My Pokémon lost... My...my pride is shattered... 
To get to Pryce, our Gym Leader, you need to think before you skate. 
I wouldn’t lose to you in skiing... 
If you don’t skate with precision, you won’t get far in this Gym. 
Check out my parallel turn! 
No! You made me wipe out! 
I shouldn’t have been bragging about my skiing... 
Hey hey, are you shivering? Are you scared to fight me? 
You’re so strong, it’s scary! 
The strongest don’t usually look very strong. I think you fit that description. 
This Gym has a slippery floor. It’s fun, isn’t it? But hey--we’re not playing games here! 
Do you see how serious we are? 
This Gym is great. I love snowboarding with my Pokémon! 
I know Pryce’s secret. 
OK. I’ll tell you Pryce’s secret. 
The reason Pryce is strong... It’s because every day he sits on top of very cold ice and trains his body and spirit! 
Your first battle against dragons? I’ll show you how tough they are! 
That’s too bad. 
You’ve met the Dragon Tamer Lance? I don’t believe you. 
It’s not as if we all use Dragon-type Pokémon. It’s about more than that-- We’re interested in strong Pokémon. That’s my theme! 
Just what I expected. 
I need to make my Pokémon stronger! Pokémon and Trainers both need to train! 
My chance of losing? Not even one percent! 
That’s odd. 
I know my shortcomings now. Thanks for showing me! 
I’ve been training hard with Clair. There’s no way I can lose! 
...Oh, that’s disappointing! 
Oh... Looks like I need more training, huh? 
Dragons are sacred Pokémon. They are full of life energy. If you’re not serious, you won’t be able to beat them. 
Way to go! 
Dragons are weak against Dragon-type moves. 
We Psychics don’t give up even when we’re down to the last Pokémon. That’s what makes us so formidable! 
Until we hit zero, our power is limitless. I’m not giving up yet! 
I... I can’t...believe it... 
One Pokémon left? Ha ha ha! I’ve been counting on this one from the very beginning! 
Ooooof... 
Ah! You have proven your worth! 
Fight as hard as you can ’til you faint! 
We’re standing firm! 
Why?! ...How could we lose? 
This is far from being backed into a corner! 
You’re no ordinary Trainer to have gotten this far. 
Well, aren’t you good. I like that in a Trainer. 
All right! I thought this would never happen! 
I never give up, no matter what. You must be the same? 
...It’s over. But it’s an odd feeling. I’m not angry that I lost. In fact, I feel happy. Happy that I witnessed the rise of a great new Champion!

Heh heh heh... You’re unprepared for this. We’ll knock you down! 
Perhaps I’m the one who was unprepared? 
This is the real power of Johto... 
Ah ha ha! It itches! It itches! 
Ow ow ow ow ow... 
Looks like you’re the stronger one... 
Hmm... You’re pretty good... 
Looks like you’re not just someone who gets in the way... 
Looks like this is it... 
It’s not over yet. It’s just beginning! 
Oh, last one! Never give up! 
My electric trick... 
Don’t go easy on me. Give me everything you’ve got! 
Wow, that’s a bit harsh! 
Looks like I underestimated you... 
You’ve got a great battle technique! 
Not good. Seriously not good. 
...!!! So... So strong! 
What will happen after this? I already know. 
Was the future I saw...wrong? 
I get it... 
I’ll show you the spirit of this cave Gym! 
We can still do it! 
My spirit has not been defeated! 
Heh heh heh... You’re unprepared for this. We’ll knock you down! 
Perhaps I’m the one who was unprepared? 
Just as I expected! No wonder you’ve become the Champion... 
Ah ha ha! It itches! It itches! 
Ow ow ow ow ow... 
Looks like you’re the stronger one... 
Hmm... You’re pretty good... 
Looks like you’re not just someone who gets in the way...

Was the future I saw...wrong? 
I get it... 
I’ll show you the spirit of my cave Gym! 
We can still do it! 
My spirit has not been defeated! 
Anyway, fight me and see! 
I was deceived! 
Me, I should be a pretty good practice partner... I shouldn’t say that about myself! 
What do you think? You’ve never seen such a wonderful Gym before, have you? 
Whatever! 
There are many kinds of Gyms in the world, but I really like this one! 
Looking around the room like that, doesn’t it make you a little dizzy? 
All of my Pokémon... All dizzy and fainting... 
Looks like you’ve still got some energy left. 
Ida: I’m Ida! Next to me is Elan! Together, we’re a double team! 
Ida: Wow. You’re really something. 
Ida: If the only thing Gym Trainers have is strength, they won’t do well. Bringing out your opponent’s strength is also very important! Elan: You’re stronger than we anticipated! 
Ida: All right, let’s go! I bet that’s what you were thinking! But you’ve only got one Pokémon. So we can’t battle. 
Elan: All right, let’s get this fight started! Come on! 
Elan: Well, this is surprising. 
Elan: Phew... 
Elan: Huh? Not enough Pokémon? 
The Trainers of this Gym use Rock-type Pokémon. Rock-type Pokémon have high Defense. Battles could end up going a long time. Are you ready for this? 
I have to win these battles... 
Hey, you! Trainer from Johto! Brock is tough. He’ll punish you if you don’t take him seriously. 
R-r-r-r-R-r-r-R-R-r-R-R-R-R--CRASH! 
BOOM! 
Phew... Broken in pieces. 
Glub... I’m first! Come and get me! 
This can’t be... 
Misty says I have gotten much better in the past few years. But there are still Trainers who are stronger than me. 
I’ve been relaxing poolside, so I’ve got enough strength! 
You can’t win with strength alone. 
Hey, let’s go for a swim! Sailors have to be able to swim! 
Sorry about being away. Let’s get on with it! 
I give up! You’re the winner! 
I’ll be swimming quietly. 
Don’t get nervous watching my magnificent swimming! 
You’re not nervous at all. Cool and confident...! 
Swimming is very good for both beauty and health! Just look at Misty, you’ll see. 
Swimming isn’t just about speed! It’s also about the beauty of grace! 
I lost beautifully... 
It seems an intruder has appeared in this Gym... I don’t like that idea... 
You’re here to defeat Lt. Surge? Not if I can help it! 
Sorry I failed you, Lt. Surge, sir! 
When I was in the military, this is what Lt. Surge taught me... Lock the doors, watch out for fire, and always have two electric fences for safety! 
Lt. Surge saw my potential with Electric-type Pokémon. Think you can beat me? 
Ooh, how shocking! 
The reason that Lt. Surge is protected by electric fences isn’t because he’s a coward! It’s so you won’t underestimate his strength! 
I’m going to take you down! Prepare to be shocked! 
Gyaaah! I was overpowered! 
Lt. Surge hid the electric fences’ switches at the bottom of something... There are two switches. Once you’ve found the first, the second switch should be right next to it. 
Jo: We protect Erika! 
Jo & Zoe: We lost...
Jo: Wow, you’re about as strong as Erika, huh!
Jo: I don’t know anyone who has only one Pokémon!
Zoe: We’re going to protect Erika! 
Jo & Zoe: We couldn’t win... 
Zoe: How come you’re that strong? 
Zoe: I don’t know anyone who has only one Pokémon! 
There’s no way I can let some unknown Trainer go straight to Erika! 
Oh, bleah! 
I’m too ashamed to face Erika! 
Do you think a girls-only Gym is rare? 
Ohh... I lost... 
Thanks for not going easy on me! 
How can I get you to understand my hobby? Which is... talking in a deep voice! 
Whoa! 
The kindness of a woman and the strength of a man... I want to be a Trainer with both those qualities! 
My disguise was awesome! Grrr! 
I had you fooled... 
Ooh... I lost... You’re not weak... 
Oh, dear! I wanted to win! 
Psychic power is the power of your mind. 
Your mind has more power than mine! 
You made your mind stronger, not just your abilities. 
The Fighting Dojo next door was once this city’s Gym. 
I was no match... 
Karate King, the master of the Fighting Dojo, was just destroyed by Sabrina. 
The power of all those you defeated comes to me! 
Strong... Far too strong... 
What is the source of your power? 
Fufufufu... I see it clearly. I can see into your spirit! 
Though I read you, I still lost... 
Oops! I forgot that I predicted I would lose to you. 
You there! Want to battle? 
Down and out... 
You’re strong. You obviously have trained hard. 
If Trainers meet, the first thing to do is battle. 
Awww... I’ve got a losing record... 
For Trainers, it’s a given that we’ll battle whenever we meet. 
My bug Pokémon are tough. Prepare to lose! 
I was whipped... 
I’m going to look for stronger bug Pokémon. 
My bug Pokémon have been waiting for you! 
If you walk in tall grass wearing shorts, do you get nicks and cuts? 
Ouch, ouch, ouch! 
They’ll really sting when you take a bath. 
Why do girls dislike bug Pokémon so much? 
No good! 
Bug Pokémon squish like soft, toy Pokémon when you squeeze their bellies. I love how they feel! 
Have you come to understand the merits of bug Pokémon? 
Ah! The weather’s as fine as ever. 
It’s sunny, but in my heart, it’s rainy... 
When it rains, it’s hard to get fired up. I just simmer... 
Step right up and take a look! 
Yow! That’s hot! 
The greatest fire-breather in Kanto, that’s me. But not the best Trainer... 
Hmmm... I don’t know what to do... 
I knew I’d lose... 
You looked strong. I was afraid to take you on... 
I can run like the wind! 
Blown away! 
I wear shorts the whole year round. That’s my fashion policy. 
I’m raising my Pokémon. Want to battle with me? 
Aw, I can’t believe I lost... 
If you have a specific Pokémon that you want to raise, put it out first, then switch it right away. That’s how to do it. 
I have a feeling that I can win. Let’s see if I’m right! 
Aww, you are too strong. 
I heard CLEFAIRY appear at Mt. Moon. But where could they be? 
Um... I... 
... 
... ...I’ll go train some more... 
My PHANPY is the cutest in the world. 
My PHANPY! 
Take a look at this--this PHANPY’s absolutely adorable behavior! Isn’t it wonderfully cute? I just wanna squeeze it! 
My TEDDIURSA is the cutest in the world. 
My TEDDIURSA! 
Take a look at this--this TEDDIURSA’s absolutely adorable behavior! Isn’t it wonderfully cute? I just wanna squeeze it! 
We’re the Kanto Pokémon Federation Trainer group. We’ll drive you under our wheels! 
S-sorry! 
The Kanto Pokémon Federation will never fall! 
The cops shut down our Underground Path! That really annoys me! 
F-forgive me! 
Wiped out by some punk from Johto... 
We’re the Kanto Pokémon Federation! Rock on! 
Yikes! Sorry! 
We’ll try not to disturb anyone from now on... 
How does the Magnet Train work? 
I wish I had the chance to see the Magnet Train... 
The power of magnets is awesome! 
Hmm... You’ve got many Gym Badges. 
Just as I thought... You’re tough! 
That’s to be expected for someone who has as many Gym Badges as you do! 
I came to explore Rock Tunnel. 
Whoa! Danger, eh? 
My Pokémon were hurt before even entering Rock Tunnel. I’d better take them to a Pokémon Center right away. 
Hey, you! Don’t litter! 
I was just pointing out... 
Sorry. You weren’t littering. It was my mistake. 
Mt. Silver is in Johto, right? It must be a silver mountain! 
I was kind of focused on the mountain and forgot my Pokémon... 
Battles are about concentration. 
I’ll tell you a secret. But first, we battle! 
Grr! I lost that... 
The Power Plant is across a small river. 
Have you ever been to a picnic? They’re so much fun! 
Ohhhh! 
We bake lots of goodies and share them around. They’re delicious! 
People shouldn’t leave any litter behind. 
Ohh... I lost... 
Conserving energy is important, but the environment is even more vital. 
You really love Pokémon, don’t you? I love Pokémon, too! 
Looks like this means it’s my loss. 
My dearest, very important Pokémon... I won’t forget what you did! 
Hahahah! 
Hahaha-hachoo! 
Hay fever is making me sneeze! Ahahah-CHOO! 
... 
... 
... I lost while I had my eyes closed... 
I can see it... Everything there is to see about you... 
I couldn’t foresee your power... 
Strength in conviction... You’re strong because you believe in your Pokémon. 
There’s no cheating with Pokémon. Let’s keep it fair and square! 
Huh? How did this happen? 
I fought fair and square. I don’t regret this at all. 
It itches and tickles a bit when I wear shorts in the grass. 
Aiyaaah! I got stomped! 
I’m going to catch more Pokémon in the grass. 
Do you remember? 
You do remember? 
The tug you feel on the fishing line when you hook a Pokémon... That’s the best feeling ever for an angler like me. 
Ooooh! You did remember it! 
Patience is the key to both fishing and Pokémon. 
Patience! 
I’m too impatient for fishing... 
I feel so content, fishing while listening to some tunes on my radio. 
I was listening to my radio the whole time... Is that why I lost?! 
Have you checked out Kanto’s radio programs? We get a good variety here. 
What’s most important in our everyday lives? 
The answer is coming up next! 
I think electricity is the most important thing in our daily lives. If it weren’t, people wouldn’t have made such a fuss when the Power Plant went out of commission. 
Agility is the key attribute of bird Pokémon. 
You beat me with your speed... 
Your Pokémon are remarkably well trained. 
Check out my Pokémon. Just look at their coloring and plumage. 
Shoot! Not good enough! 
If you groom them, Pokémon get happy. 
Ha ha ha ha! Would you like to fight my pack of PIKACHU? 
My PIKACHU! 
You look like you have many Pokémon, but PIKACHU is still the best. 
Bow down before my regal Pokémon! 
How... How dare you mock royalty! 
Doesn’t everyone wish to be a ruler someday? 
I should go to Rock Tunnel to get myself an ONIX. 
I lost... 
Geological features don’t appear to change. But they actually do change, little by little. 
Hey, I still wanted to battle you! 
Let me tell you, I had a hard time catching my prized Pokémon. 
Awaaah! 
SQUIRTLE, CHARMANDER, and BULBASAUR... I think that’s a well-balanced mix. 
Sometimes I go back to the places I met my Pokémon. They bring back good memories. 
Where did I meet this PSYDUCK? 
When and where did I get my Pokémon... I’ll bet if I checked my Trainer Memo, I’d remember! 
My dream is to fly with my beloved bird Pokémon. 
I can dream, but I can’t ever fly... 
You have Pokémon that know the HM move Fly, don’t you? I envy you. 
Hang on. I have to phone my mom. 
Sorry, Mom! I was beaten! 
My mom worries so much about me, I have to phone her all the time. 
We’re on a school trip to Lavender Radio Tower for social studies. 
You’re wickedly tough! 
I’m tired of walking. I need to take a break. 
Let’s battle. I won’t lose! 
I forgot to do my homework! 
Sayonara! I just learned that in my foreign-language class. 
I love gym class the best! 
Oh, no! How could I lose? 
If Pokémon were a subject at school, I’d be the best! 
Welcome, welcome! Here you will face a battle with me, and I’m really athletic! 
Have you forgotten anything? 
Kyaaah! 
Before I became a teacher, I used to forget a lot of things. 
On sunny days, I think that the kids would rather be playing in the playground than studying in class. 
I didn’t want to lose... 
Studying is important, but exercise is just as vital. 
You’re back. To study? Or to battle Pokémon? 
Hey, you! You’re from Johto, huh? 
Whoa, you’re kickin’!
Don’t get cocky, you Johto punk! 
Hey! I’ve been waiting for you! You Johto punk! 
Wow. That’s a cool Bicycle! 
But you don’t just look cool... 
I look cool, but I’m weak, so I’m not really cool. I have to train harder... 
Hey! Want to have a speed battle? 
Yikes! You’ve got awesome torque! 
Hands-free riding is considered cool on Cycling Road. 
We’re fearless highway stars! 
Arrrgh! Crash and burn! 
Reckless riding causes accidents! Take it easy! 
If you’re looking for Pokémon, you have to look in the tall grass. 
Aiyeee! 
Since you’re so strong, it must be fun to battle. 
Cycling Road is a quick shortcut to Celadon. 
...Whew! 
If you don’t have a Bicycle, you’re not allowed to use the shortcut. 
Have you ever gone swimming in the sea at night? 
Glub... 
At night, the sea looks black. It feels like it will swallow you up. 
Swimming? I’m lousy at it. I’m just splashing around in these shallow waters. 
I thought I could win. 
I might be bad at swimming, but I love the sea. 
Pant, pant... Just...a little... farther...to...Fuchsia... 
I’m drowning! 
I...asked my girlfriend to swim to Fuchsia... Gasp... 
I’m disgusted by wimpy people! 
I could beat you at swimming... 
It’s a quick swim between Fuchsia and Seafoam Islands... Sheesh, some big man my boyfriend is! What a wimp! 
I guess it’s impossible to swim all the way to Johto. 
Aiyah! 
Besides the sea, I can also swim in ponds and rivers. 
I feel so much lighter in water. 
Oh, no! 
Swimming exercises your full body. It’s really good for you. 
What an impressive collection of Gym Badges. We should battle! 
No! 
Surf is no longer the only HM move you use in water. 
I’m bored by fishing. Let’s battle! 
Utter failure... 
I’ll just go back to fishing... 
Gotta keep going! 
Glug... 
This arrogant guy was at Cinnabar’s volcano. 
Oh! Hey, you! Will you help me with my sunblock? Don’t tell me... You’d rather battle? 
I’m worried about sunburn... 
I have to watch out for blemishes caused by the sun. 
Ayieeeh! No, no, no, believe it I can’t! Strong very much be you! Match I am not to you! 
OK! I’m No. 4. I’ll stomp you! 
Whoa! Too much. 
We both did our best. I have no regrets! 
But after seeing how you battle, I want to see how I’ll fare. How about it? Let me take you on. 
I’ve never had a battle this good! 
That was a great battle! You and your Pokémon are truly outstanding! 
I’m No. 5! Getting tired? 
I lost, too... 
I did my best. I have no regrets. 
I’m the last in line, but I tell you, I’m tough! 
You’re kidding! 
I did my best. I have no regrets. 
I’m second. Now, it’s serious! 
How could I lose? 
I did my best. I have no regrets. 
Beat the six of us Trainers to win a fabulous prize! Think you’ve got what it takes? 
Whoo! Good stuff. 
I did my best. I have no regrets. 
Here’s No. 3! I won’t be easy. 
Ow! Stomped flat! 
I did my best. I have no regrets. 
Mufufufu... I have nothing to do with the six-pack Trainers. I waited here to beat you when you were tired out by all the battles. 
Aren’t you tired at all? 
I’m sorry... I won’t cheat anymore... 
I’m making my final preparations for the Pokémon League. 
I blew it! 
It’s going to be tough to win at the League. I need to do some more training. I hear that the League’s Elite Four are tougher than Gym Leaders. 
By experiencing tough battles, you gain power. 
Gah! Life is even tougher! 
To get to the Pokémon League, you have to get through Victory Road. But Victory Road is tough. Practically nobody goes there! 
I want to see how close you are to real strength! 
Since you’ve come this far, you must be good. I’m going to give this battle everything I’ve got! 
No! I don’t believe this! 
I’ve defeated eight Gym Leaders, so I was feeling confident. I’ll have to try harder next time. 
I lost to a redheaded Trainer. He was really strong, but...it was as if he absolutely had to win at any cost. I felt sorry for his Pokémon. 
Pokémon aren’t tools of war. 
Pokémon are invaluable, lifelong partners. 
You get along really well with your Pokémon, don’t you? Can you show me once more? 
Wow, look at all those Badges! I’m impressed. But you’re not satisfied by just collecting them, right? 
Good battle! 
People and Pokémon grow from their experiences. Don’t get lazy and complacent. 
I’m feeling great today! I feel like I could even beat the League Champion! 
No! Not in this battle! 
Just like in fishing, it’s all over in Pokémon if you give up. 
Tweet! Tweet! Tet-weet! 
Tweet! 
Bird Keepers like me mimic bird whistles to command Pokémon. 
Tweet! I’ve been waiting for this! Teweet! 
You look pretty strong. Let me battle you! 
...! 
If you prevail on this harsh trek, the truth will be revealed! Heh, sorry, I just wanted to say something cool. 
Hm? You’re good, aren’t you? 
Just as I thought! 
A good Trainer can recognize other good Trainers. 
You came from New Bark Town? You must be exhausted. 
Oh! You’re much too strong! 
If you’re that energetic, you can definitely make it to the Pokémon League! 
You said you came from New Bark Town, right? I’ll watch and see how far you’ll go! 
It’s rare to see anyone come here. Are you training on your own? 
Oh! You’re really strong! 
I’m checking out pre- and post-evolution Pokémon. Evolution really does make Pokémon stronger. But evolved forms also learn moves later on. 
Don’t say a thing! Let me guess what you’re thinking. Mmmmmmm... I got it! You’re on the Pokémon League challenge! 
You’re too much! 
With your skills, you’ll do well at the Pokémon League. That’s what my premonition says. 
I just lost, so I’m trying to find more Pokémon. Wait! You look weak! Come on, let’s battle! 
Oh... I’m out of Pokémon that can fight. 
I knew it--if you don’t have many Pokémon, battles are harder! I need to catch more Pokémon! 
I’ve been waiting! Let’s battle now! 
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, right? Then you have to battle! 
That’s strange. I won before. 
Becoming a good Trainer is really tough. I’m going to battle other people to get better. 
Instead of a bug Pokémon, I found a Trainer! 
Argh! You’re too strong! 
I ran out of Poké Balls while I was catching Pokémon. I should’ve bought some more... 
I caught a bunch of Pokémon. Let me battle with you! 
Awwwww... 
You can catch Pokémon even if you have six with you. If you catch one, it’ll go to your Box automatically. 
I was waiting for you. Let’s battle! 
That Badge! It’s from Violet City! You beat Falkner? 
I know what my weaknesses are. 
I should train again at the Gym in Violet City. 
That glance... It’s intriguing. 
Hmmm. This is disappointing. 
If you don’t want to battle, just avoid eye contact. 
Whoa! You made me lose that fish! 
Sploosh! 
Calm, collected... The essence of fishing and Pokémon is the same. 
I’m really good at fishing, but I’m even better at Pokémon! 
Tch! I tried to rush things... 
Fishing is a lifelong passion. Pokémon are lifelong friends! 
Oh look, a kid challenger! This old man ain’t losing today! 
My Pokémon? Freshly caught! 
Splash? 
Freshly caught Pokémon are no match for properly raised ones. 
Uh-huh. Yeah, and you know... Pardon? Pokémon battle? I’m on the phone. Oh, all right. I’ll accept your challenge! 
Pfft. Before I could get serious, I lost! 
At least I can complain over the phone. 
You’re late! Let’s get started now! 
I haven’t seen you around before. So you think you’re pretty tough? 
You’re strong! 
I’m going to try to be the best with my prized Pokémon. I’m not using the same tough Pokémon as everyone else. 
I found some good Pokémon in the grass! I think they’ll do it for me! 
Shucks. I thought I could win. 
Each Pokémon has its own nature. They seem different every time I catch one. So there must be many natures! 
I came through the cave, but I still have plenty of energy left. 
Whoa! You’ve got more zip than me! 
We Hikers are at our best in the mountains. 
All righty, then! My Pokémon and I are raring to go! 
I’m confident in my ability to raise Pokémon. Want to see? 
Didn’t I train enough? 
Hmm... Maybe I should take them to Pokémon Day Care? What should I do? 
Hey, you’re back! Battle my carefully trained Pokémon! 
I just got my Pokémon back from Day Care. Let’s see how much stronger it got! 
Why does it end this way? 
My Pokémon knew moves I didn’t know it had. That confounded me to no end! 
Kate: You sure were mean to my little sisters! 
Kate: No! I can’t believe I lost. 
Kate: You’re too strong. I didn’t stand a chance. Here. You deserve this. 
Irene: Eeek! A Trainer! 
Irene: Ohhh! Too strong! 
Irene: My sister Kate will get you for this! 
Jenn: You can’t beat Irene and go unpunished! 
Jenn: So sorry, Irene! Sis! 
Jenn: Don’t get cocky! My sister Kate is tough! 
Are you a Trainer? Let’s have a practice battle. 
Oh, no! I just can’t win... 
You’re too strong to be a practice partner. 
You’re here! You’re here! I’ve never had a practice partner before! 
What’s with you? What are you doing? 
You don’t have to worry about the night when you’re with strong Pokémon. 
The group stealing other people’s Pokémon seems to be growing lately. You should be careful, too. 
This is where I do my training! 
Whoa! 
If you fail in practice, then you have to try harder! I’m aiming to be a Gym Leader! 
I’m the best in my class at Pokémon. 
No! There are better Trainers... 
I’m trying hard so I can be the star in my class. 
I’ve been waiting! 
What kinds of Poké Balls do you use? 
Yikes! Not fast enough! 
Some Pokémon flee right away. Try catching them with Kurt’s Fast Ball. Whenever I find a Wht. Apricorn, I take it to Kurt. He turns it into a custom Ball. 
I’ve been getting Pokémon data off my radio. I think I’m good. 
I give up! 
Music on the radio changes the moods of wild Pokémon. 
I’m gonna show my girlfriend I’m hot stuff! 
I wish you would have lost for me... 
I was humiliated in front of my girlfriend... 
I’m practicing my fire breathing. 
Ow! I scorched the tip of my nose! 
The Pokémon March on the radio lures wild Pokémon. 
I’ve been practicing breathing fire while waiting for you! 
Behold my dexterity and grace! 
Whew! That was a jolt! 
I was going to dazzle you with my prize Pokémon. But your prowess electrified me! 
Yo! I’ve been waiting! 
I’ll go anywhere if bug Pokémon appear there. 
I see. So you can battle that way. 
My VENONAT won me the Bug-Catching Contest at the National Park. 
As long as I’ve got bug Pokémon, it doesn’t matter how long I have to wait. I know I won’t get bored! 
My boyfriend’s weak, so I can’t rely on him. 
Oh, my! You’re so strong! 
I can count more on my Pokémon than on my boyfriend. 
Are you going to the Gym? Me, too! 
Oh. I couldn’t win... 
The Gym Badges are pretty. I collect them. 
Danger lurks in the night! 
Whoops! 
You know, nighttime is fun in its own way. But don’t overdo it, OK? 
Let me guess what you’re thinking! 
I was wrong. 
If you read your opponent’s mind, then you can attack more efficiently! 
I can properly prepare for any Pokémon adversary! 
Huh...? Was my prediction incorrect? 
Sniffle... I study for five hours straight every day... If you only read the textbook, I guess you miss out on a lot. 
I’ve prepared perfectly, waiting for you! 
Pokémon can’t do a thing if they are asleep. I’ll show you how scary that is! 
I lost. That’s pretty sad... 
Making Pokémon sleep or paralyzing them are good battle techniques. 
Tori: Let’s battle! 
Tori: I lost... 
Tori: Even though I teamed up with Til, we still lost... 
Tori: Let’s have a Pokémon battle when you’ve got at least two Pokémon. 
Til: All right, I’m bringing out a Pokémon. 
Til: I lost... 
Til: Even though Tori tried very hard for me, we still lost... 
Til: We can’t battle you if you’ve only got one Pokémon... 
Fly high into the sky, my beloved bird Pokémon! 
I feel like just flying away now. 
I plan to train in Cianwood City to teach my Pokémon how to Fly. 
Hey, are you good at Pokémon? If you’re really good, I want you to teach me some things. 
I see. So you can battle that way. 
I know something good! Moomoo Farm’s milk is famous for its taste. 
Oh, here you are again! There’s so many more things I want to learn from you! 
I’ve been overseas, so I know about all sorts of Pokémon! 
Your skill is world class! 
All kinds of people around the world live happily with Pokémon. 
Let me try something I learned today. 
I didn’t study enough, I guess. 
I have to take so many tests, I don’t have much time for Pokémon. So when I do get to battle, I really concentrate. 
You’ve come to the right place! Time for me to try out everything I’ve learned today! 
Hi! Aren’t you a cute Trainer! May I see your Pokémon? 
I’m glad I got to see your Pokémon! 
When I see Pokémon, it seems to soothe my nerves. 
Let me see what your Pokémon are capable of. 
Ooh, your Pokémon have potential. 
You know how Pokémon have different abilities? People are like that, too. Everyone has different potential. 
Is it OK to brag about my Pokémon? 
I couldn’t brag... 
I’m not listening to your bragging! We Pokéfans have a policy of not listening to other people brag! 
I’ve been waiting! I’ve been wanting to brag to you!  
Such darling Pokémon. Let’s show our Pokémon together at the same time. 
I don’t mind losing. 
Do you know about baby Pokémon? I’ll bet they’re just adorable! 
I just got back to Olivine. So, how about a Pokémon battle? 
Awaaargh! 
My Pokémon were caught and raised overseas. They’re my companions on those long voyages. 
You have to warm up before going into the water. That’s basic. 
OK! I give up! 
Cianwood City is a good distance away from here. 
Hey, you’re young and fit! Don’t ride your Pokémon! Swim! 
Uh-oh. I lost... 
Swimming exercises your entire body. It’s healthy. 
Are you going to Cianwood? How about a quick battle first? 
I lost that one! 
I’d say I’m a better swimmer than you. Yeah! 
No inflatable tube for me. I’m hanging on to a sea Pokémon! 
Ooh, I’m feeling dizzy! 
While I float like this, the waves carry me along. 
The water’s warm here. I’m loose and limber. Sure, I’ll take you on! 
Yikes! I’ve got prune skin! 
Isn’t it relaxing, just floating like this? 
I’m a bit tired. If I win, lend me your Pokémon. 
Pant, pant... 
It’s so far to Cianwood. But it’s no easy return trip to Olivine either. What should I do? 
See those islands that are blocked by whirlpools? There just has to be a secret! 
What’s the secret to your strength? 
It was a dark and stormy night... I saw this giant Pokémon flying from the Whirl Islands. Feathers were scattering from its silver wings. 
The waves are wild here. They tire you out as you swim. 
I’m beat! 
The currents keep me from reaching that island. 
Are you seeking the secrets of the Whirl Islands? 
Ooh, you’ve got great endurance! 
A secret about the Whirl Islands... It’s pitch black inside! 
I’m on my way to the Whirl Islands. I’m going exploring with friends. 
Is that how you do it? 
There’s supposed to be a big Pokémon deep beneath the Whirl Islands. I wonder what it could be? 
You look so elegant riding your Pokémon. 
I’m crushed... 
Wasn’t there a hit song about a boy riding a LAPRAS? 
The weather is so beautiful, I’m in a daze! 
Ohhh! 
A sunburn is the worst for skin. But I don’t use sunblock. I won’t pollute the water. 
If you need to rest, just tread water. You’ll get your breath back so you can keep on going strong. 
Oh! You have more energy than I do. 
I heard roars from deep inside the islands. 
At night, STARYU gather near the water’s surface. 
Oh, dear... 
The clusters of STARYU light up at the same time. It’s so beautiful, it’s scary. 
Let me demonstrate the power of the Pokémon I caught! 
What? That’s not right. 
I want to become the Trainer Champ using the Pokémon I caught. That’s the best part of fishing! 
Me? I haven’t been waiting at all. I didn’t know that fishing would be so boring! 
Hey! This is my secret place! Get lost, you outsider! 
I should have used my Moon Stone... 
You’re working on a Pokédex? Wow, you must know some pretty rare Pokémon! May I please see it? Please? 
What’s the other side of Mt. Mortar like, do you know? If you can beat me, I’ll let you know. 
Gwah ha ha! I lost! 
I said a pretty boastful lie. I’m sorry! There’s this huge waterfall in the way, so I’ve never been on the other side of Mt. Mortar! 
I can do so much with my Pokémon! It’s super fun! 
Losing isn’t fun at all... 
What is going on at Lake of Rage? We were planning to camp there. 
I’m in a slump. Maybe it’s the gear I’m using. Let’s battle for a change of pace! 
I lost, but I feel better anyway. 
Kurt’s Lure Ball is the best for catching hooked Pokémon. It’s much more effective than an Ultra Ball. 
I love Pokémon! That’s why I started--and why I’ll keep on collecting Pokémon! 
How could you do this to me? 
What else do I like besides Pokémon? Mary, on the radio. I bet she’s cute! 
Hey! Do you have any rare Pokémon? 
Oh, my poor Pokémon! Darlings! 
I’d be happy just to own a single rare Pokémon. 
I’ve been waiting! Did you bring any rare Pokémon with you? 
Would you get this? Some red-haired kid made fun of my precious Pokémon! Humph! My Pokémon’s great! 
My NIDOKING was outstanding! 
It’s OK for people to like different types of Pokémon. Pokémon isn’t just about having the most powerful one. 
Are you going to Lake of Rage, too? Let’s play for a little while! 
I played too much! 
I’m having a picnic with Pokémon. Won’t you join us? 
Hey, you’re here! Let’s play! 
Do you know about the legendary bird Pokémon? 
Whew! You’re hot stuff. 
ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES are the three legendary bird Pokémon. I heard there are other legendary birds, though. 
How has it been? Did you see the legendary Pokémon? 
I can tell you’re a good Trainer by looking at you. I’m good at Pokémon, and I can see that you are, too. 
Tch! It’s a total loss on my part. 
Wow. You have a lot of Badges. No wonder you’re so tough. I wonder if Ecruteak Gym’s Morty is still in training? He really hammered me. 
You look strong. Good Trainers seek tough opponents instinctively. 
Nope! This won’t do at all. 
We all get better by experiencing many battles. I battled a lot to become what I am today--an elite. 
I’m gonna win for sure! 
Arrgh... That’s a shocking loss... 
It’s important to have conviction on your side. 
Aack! You made me lose a POLIWAG! What are you going to do about it? 
Just forget about it. 
That POLIWAG that got away... It was huge. I swear it must’ve been 82 feet long! 
Hey! I’ve been waiting for you! ...Oops, maybe I shouldn’t yell so loud. The POLIWAG ran away... 
I fish until I can’t anymore. I also battle until I drop. That’s my relationship with my Pokémon. 
Hmmmm... This isn’t right. 
That’s 100 wins to 101 losses. I won’t battle again for a while. 
I’ll do anything to get my hands on rare Pokémon! 
Oooh, your Pokémon are so appealing. 
If a Pokémon has different colors than usual, it’s more valuable. What? You mean that’s not true? 
What is your battle strategy? It is foolish to use strong moves indiscriminately. 
Fine. I lost. 
I’m not for overly powerful moves. I want to win, but I also don’t want to harm Pokémon. 
What are your thoughts on raising Pokémon? 
You’ve won my respect. 
I see you’re raising your Pokémon with care. The bond you build will save you in tough situations. 
I was training here alone. Behold the result of my hard work! 
Waaaargh! 
This calls for extreme measures. I must take to the hills and train in solitude. 
I’ve been studying while waiting for you to come back... Let me show you the results! 
Be prepared for anything! Let me see if your Pokémon have been raised properly! 
Oh, I lost that! 
I’ll head back to Blackthorn’s Ice Path and train some more. 
Yo! You’re tough! But you know what? When it comes to sheer toughness, I’m the man! 
My Pokémon weren’t tough enough! 
Boy, do I love HP Up! Mmmm, yum! I keep drinking my Pokémon’s! I can’t help it! 
My Pokémon are power packed! 
Wahahah! I’m the big loser! 
I’m not much good at thinking, see? So I just plow ahead with power! 
I’ve been waiting! 
Why do I climb mountains? Because they’re there. Why do I train Pokémon? Because they’re there! 
Losses... They’re there, too! 
The best thing ever to happen to me was discovering Pokémon. 
I’m raising Pokémon, too! Will you battle with me? 
Wha...? 
I did my best but came up short. No excuses--I admit I lost. 
Awright! I’ll show you the power of mountain Pokémon! 
Mercy! You showed me your power! 
It’s over. I don’t mind. We Hikers are like that. 
I raise Pokémon, too! Will you battle with me? 
Oh, bleah! 
If you’ve promised to have a rematch, your opponent’s location will be marked with an “!” on the map. You can check it on your Pokégear. 
Hey, have you gone and visited many Gyms since then? 
Oh, you are truly strong. 
Oh, so close! I almost had you. 
I don’t have any Pokémon left... 
Oh, you are wonderful... 
Ooh, you’re good at Pokémon, too. 
Looks like I lost... 
If a Trainer spots another Trainer, he or she has to make a challenge. That is our destiny. 
Whew... Good battle. 
Pokémon and their Trainer become powerful through constant battling. 
The red GYARADOS? That sounds scary. It must be red with rage! Me? I’m not angry or anything, but let’s battle! 
Good going! 
Come to think of it, I’ve seen a pink BUTTERFREE. 
Let me battle with the Pokémon I just caught! 
I might be an expert angler, but I stink as a Pokémon Trainer... 
I won’t lose as an angler! I catch Pokémon all day. 
No matter what I do, all I catch are the same Pokémon... 
My line’s all tangled up... 
Why can’t I catch any good Pokémon? 
Are you alone? Then let’s battle! 
That’s too much to handle! 
I wonder if there are any mountains worth climbing in Kanto? 
I’m going to Kanto to put on fire-breathing shows! 
Fizzle... The flame’s tiny... 
I guess fire is weak on the sea... It doesn’t matter? Really? 
Hey, kid! Want to battle with me? 
You’re strong! 
You’re traveling all alone? Isn’t your mom worried? 
You think I’m a baby? That’s not fair! 
Oh! We lost!
Baby is a rude name to call someone!
You’ve got only one Pokémon? Then I’m not battling with you.
I’m not a baby! That’s not a nice thing to say! 
Oh! We lost! 
Sometimes, kids are smarter than grown-ups! 
If you don’t bring more Pokémon, then you can’t play with everyone. 
Urrf... I’m seasick! 
I can’t move anymore... 
No more ships for me. Next time, I’m taking the Magnet Train. 
Nothing beats a battle when I’m on my break. 
Win or lose, my break’s over! 
I guess I can’t win if I don’t get serious. 
I’m so bored. Want to battle? 
Yow! You’re too strong! 
Saffron, Celadon... I hear there are many big cities in Kanto. 
Oh, no. I’ve lost something that’s very important. 
I...I can’t find it... 
I give up. You don’t have to look. Just forget about it! 
I’m going to Kanto to test my skills. 
I wanted to win! 
Trainers from Johto can battle with Kanto Gym Leaders. 
I’m training to become the Champion! 
What’s so different between us? 
I’m going to beat you someday! 
I’m trying to forget my woes. Let’s battle! 
My heart weeps... 
A voyage is best for getting over a broken heart. But a Fast Ship trip is too short for grieving. 
Ssh! My brain is picking up radio signals! 
...I hear something! 
It seems that Johto’s radio shows talk about Kanto when you are in Kanto... 
What kinds of Poké Balls do you have with you? 
Wait! Stop! Don’t! Please! 
You should use the right Poké Balls to fit the situation. 
I’m building up my legs by bracing against the ship’s rocking! 
Rocked and rolled over! 
I couldn’t find the Karate King in Johto. He’s supposed to be training in a cave somewhere. 
Even though we’re out on the sea, I can’t fish! This is boring! Let’s battle! 
I...I’m not bored anymore... 
I plan to fish off Vermilion’s pier. 
This is where we sailors work! 
I lost on my home field... 
We get different passengers from Vermilion City to Olivine City. 
Yeehaw! Lucky! 
How unlucky! I lost! 
I found a pretty coin here.  Someone must have lost it... 
Do you know Mary? She’s a popular DJ in Johto. 
Gyaaaah! 
Mary’s the best! I want to be a DJ, too! 
I’m visiting my grandma to catch me some bugs! 
Ooh, wow! You’re tough! 
I’ll catch all the Pokémon you can find only in Johto! 
I’m going to audition my songs at Goldenrod’s Radio Tower. 
Yowza! Total distortion! 
Speaking of the Radio Tower, what is Buena’s password for today? 
What do you think? My Pokémon are beautiful, yes? 
Oh, no! My beautiful Pokémon! 
I must take them to the Pokémon Salon and get them fixed up nice! 
I’m going to shop at the Dept. Store and then... 
What was I going to do? 
Oh, yes! I have to get my Pokémon out of Day Care! 
Don’t lay a finger on my students! 
Aaack! 
We’re on a school trip to the ruins outside Violet. 
Do you know the Ruins of Alph? 
Yaargh! 
Radios pick up strange signals inside the ruins. 
There are some odd stone panels in the Ruins of Alph. 
I was taken down! 
I read that there are four of those stone panels. 
I’m a sailor man! But I’m training Pokémon, so I can become the Champion! 
My lack of training is obvious... 
Those Badges you’re carrying... Let me guess. Those are the ones you get when you defeat Gym Leaders, right? That means you’re pretty strong! 
We stand guard in this tower. Here, we express our gratitude to show our respect for all Pokémon. 
Th-thank you! 
All living beings coexist through cooperation. We must always be thankful for this. 
However hard we battle, the tower will stand strong. 
I fought hard, but I’m too weak. 
The flexible pillar protects the tower, even from earthquakes. 
I train to find enlightenment in Pokémon! 
This little squirt sure made me hurt! 
As Pokémon grow stronger, so does the Trainer. No, wait. As the Trainer grows stronger, so do the Pokémon. 
Let me see how much you trust your Pokémon. 
Yes, your trust is real! 
It is not far to the Elder. 
I sway like leaves in the wind... 
Oh, I’m weak! 
I tried to copy BELLSPROUT’s gentle movements for battle... But I didn’t train well enough. 
The Elder’s TM lights even pitch-black darkness. 
It is my head that is bright! 
Let there be light on your journey. 
So good of you to come here! Sprout Tower is a place of training. People and Pokémon test their bonds to build a bright future together. I am the final test. Allow me to check the ties between you and your Pokémon!
Ah, excellent! 
You and your Pokémon should have no problem using this move. Take this Flash TM. 
I’m practicing my fire breathing in the Burned Tower! Don’t try this at home! 
Pfooosh... Pfooosh... Pffffoooom... 
Oops, please don’t misunderstand! I’m not the reason that this tower is burned up! 
Don’t worry! We fire-breathers know the true power of fire better than anyone! 
Thanks for such a heated battle! 
The reason this tower’s burned is that it was hit by lightning. The fire I’m breathing is tiny in comparison... 
We adore our Pokémon, even if they dislike us. That’s what being a Pokéfan is all about. 
M-my Pokémon! 
I lost the battle, but my Pokémon win the prize for being the most lovely. 
My Pokémon is simply darling. Let me tell you how proud my darling makes me. 
I can beat you in pride, but... 
I must say, your Pokémon are quite cute, too. 
I’ve been waiting here to brag to you about my Pokémon! 
Hello? Why are you staring at me? Oh, a battle? 
...Hmmm... 
I thought I did something wrong because you kept staring at me. 
What? Staring at people’s faces. ...Oh, didn’t I make a promise to someone? Was that you? 
The world is deep. There are still lots of things we don’t know. But I know more than you do! 
Wh-wh-what? 
There is a lot to learn. For example... There are more than 90 kinds of TMs. And traded Pokémon level up faster. 
Yay! You kept your promise and came back! 
Y-you’re strong... 
Three years ago, Team Rocket was forced to disband. But we’re making a comeback here! 
Gwah! Don’t get cute! 
We won’t let you ruin our plans for our comeback! 
We’re Team Rocket! We like to cause trouble! Ooh! Are you scared? 
You think you’re a hero? 
We’re not always evil. We just do whatever we like. 
Hey, hey! Keep out of our way! 
Arggh. I give up. 
Our Executives are trying to take this place over. They have some big plan. I wonder what it is. 
Ha ha ha! How boring. It was far too easy to take over this place! Come on, keep me amused! 
Wh-who are you? 
You beat me, and I won’t forget it! 
An unknown child wandering here? Who are you? 
Tch! I took you too lightly! 
Bwahahaha... I can transmit as strong a signal as I need from here. 
I’ve been given strict orders. I’m to crush anyone who challenges Team Rocket! 
!!! 
I failed in my duties... I’ll be docked pay for this... 
It feels great ordering Pokémon to commit crimes. 
You’re kidding! 
I feel lousy over losing! Bah! I hate useless Pokémon! 
Why did the door open? Did you have something to do with this? 
Gulp! This is a bleak moment. 
What?! You made it past our men in the Underground? How could you have? 
Proton: Now, wait just one second! Aren’t you the one who got in our way at the SLOWPOKE Well? I see... You’re doing all this because you want to make me angry. Be careful! But since you seem to wish it, I’ll show you the full extent of a Team Rocket Executive’s wrath! 
Seriously, you’d chase me this far?! 
Ugh... What are you?! 
Phew... 
Proton: You may have won this time... But all you did was make Team Rocket’s wrath grow... 
Most excellent! This Radio Tower will fulfill our grand design. 
Hmmm... All grand plans come with snags. 
Do you honestly believe you can stop Team Rocket? 
You plan to rescue the Director? So sad that won’t be possible-- because I’m going to beat you! 
No! Unbelievable! 
I do not believe it! I was beaten! 
Oh, no! They’re so useless! 
What? Am I losing? 
Hey, wait, are you serious?! 
OK, OK. I’ll tell you where he is. 
Ariana: Hey, you... Remember me from the hideout in Mahogany Town? This time... Hee hee hee. This time...it looks like you’re really all alone. All alone... So it should be quite easy. Bring it! Let’s finish this!  
Hey, what do you think you’re doing?! 
Wh... Wha... Why are you so strong?! 
Aaaieeeee! This can’t be happening! I fought hard, but I still lost... 
What a waste... not to use your strength to do bad things! Feh... People like you will never in a million years understand our brilliance! It’s too bad... I’ve really come to respect your strength. 
We can’t have you getting in the way before news of our resurgence reaches Giovanni! 
That’s impossible... 
No! Forgive me, Giovanni! 
Hmmm... This is a strange place. 
... 
I like thinking here. 
ZUBAT’s Supersonic keeps confusing my Pokémon. I’m seriously upset about that! 
I flamed out! 
I’ve practiced training my Pokémon, but I’ve practiced breathing fire many more times than that. Don’t try this at home, OK? 
If there’s light, a cave isn’t scary. If you’re strong, Pokémon aren’t scary. 
FLASH! 
It’s my Pokémon’s fire that lights up this cave. 
I roam far and wide in search of Pokémon. Are you looking for Pokémon, too? Then you’re my collecting rival! 
Ugh. My poor Pokémon... 
Every Friday, you can hear Pokémon roars from deep inside the cave. 
You’re headed to Azalea, are you? Let my Pokémon see if you are good enough to battle. 
Oh, oh, oh! 
All right, then! I’ve decided. I’m not leaving until my Pokémon get tougher! 
Whoa! What a surprise! I didn’t expect to see anyone here! 
Whoa! I’m beaten big time! 
I was conned into buying a SlowpokeTail. I feel sorry for the poor Pokémon. 
Who’s there? Leave me and my Pokémon alone! 
Go... Go away! 
Just me and my Pokémon. I’m delirious with joy. 
I came all the way here to conduct my Pokémon research. Let me demonstrate my findings in a real battle! 
I’m the one who learned something from your demonstration! 
I should compile and announce my study findings. I might even become famous like Professor Elm. 
It’s been a while since I last saw another person. Don’t be shy. Let’s battle! 
Uurggh... 
I’ve been lost for a long time... I don’t mind it here, but I am soooo hungry! 
What do you know! A visitor! 
Wa ha ha! You’re a feisty one! 
I live down here. If you like, you can always come visit! 
There are two kinds of people: those with style and those without. Which kind of person are you? 
You’ve got dazzling style! 
Your Pokémon style is stunning and full of life, I admit. You’ll just keep getting better! 
I’m in training. Care for a round? 
Aww, no! You’re too good for me. 
I’m going to train by myself until I improve. 
If the Pokémon I liked were there, I’d go anywhere. That’s what a real Trainer does. 
I’d rather pet my Pokémon than battle! 
Just once a week, a Pokémon comes to the water’s edge. I wanted to see that Pokémon... 
It doesn’t matter where we go, there’s always someone who doesn’t agree with us... 
Are you serious? Did you come here thinking you could mess with our plans? 
Grr... For a kid to be this good... I didn’t see it coming. 
Quit taking SlowpokeTails? If we listened to you, Team Rocket’s rep would be ruined! 
Just... Too strong... 
We need the money, but selling SlowpokeTails? It’s tough being a Team Rocket Grunt! 
Humph! I was standing guard up top when some old coot yelled at me. He startled me so much that I fell down here. How about I vent my anger and take it out on you! 
Arrgh! This is NOT my day! 
Sure, we’ve been hacking the tails off SLOWPOKE and selling them. Team Rocket will do anything for money! 
Stop taking SlowpokeTails? What?! You want us to disobey a direct order from Executive Proton? If you want to stop us, you’ll have to defeat us all! Go ahead and try! 
You rotten brat! 
SlowpokeTails grow back fast! Besides, it was an order from Proton, so I’m more concerned about that! 
What are you here for? Just to stand around and gawk? I suggest you leave! 
You really are concerned... 
How in the world do you go up? I want to visit the sick Pokémon, but I can’t get up there... 
We’re pretty high up here. My bird Pokémon are in prime form. 
Oops... They crashed... 
My bird Pokémon trained in Cianwood. Since I’ve lost, maybe we’ll go across the sea. 
I travel the world to train my Pokémon. Now, I wish to battle with you. 
...Aww... I must train some more... 
Jasmine used to use Rock Pokémon like ONIX. 
Eh? This is no place for playing. 
Ah! I can see you’re serious. 
Up top is a Pokémon that keeps the Lighthouse lit. Pokémon glow when they are healthy, just like people. 
Hey, you’re back! 
Jasmine is this city’s Gym Leader. I intend to bring her back with me. Nobody better get in my way! 
Aaack! My Pokémon! 
Right. Anybody would be worried if his or her own Pokémon were hurt. 
Men of the sea are always spoiling for a good fight! 
Urf! I lose! 
What power! How would you like to sail the seas with me? 
Hey, you’re back! Just in time for me to show off! 
Sailors are both kind and strong. How about you? 
You are both kind and strong... 
Every time I come back to Olivine, I visit the Gym. The Gym Leader’s Pokémon type changed without my noticing. 
Jasmine must be worried sick about the Pokémon here. She won’t even smile these days. 
I can’t manage a smile, either... 
Speaking of being sick, I’ve heard there’s a good Pharmacy in Cianwood. 
I wanted to battle Jasmine, but she’s not up to it now. So how about you? 
Whoa, whoa. You’re overwhelming! 
Being a Gym Leader isn’t just about being strong. A Leader also needs to be compassionate. 
This was once a ninja hideout. There are traps to confound intruders like you. 
I see... 
The PC on my desk is the switch that deactivates the PERSIAN alarm system. Don’t you ever touch it, OK? 
Heh heh. Feeling lucky, punk? Go ahead, take another step. We’ve got explosives set in the floor! Step on one, and--BOOM! 
Kaboom! 
Where are the traps planted? That... Well... I don’t even remember! 
Grr... I failed... 
Surveillance cams are in the Pokémon statues. We’ll keep appearing until you trip a secret switch. 
Argh! I’m getting nervous! 
Eeek! 
Tch, you really are strong. It’s too bad. If you were to join Team Rocket, you could become an Executive. 
The door won’t open? Well, duh. It has to have a password that only Team Rocket knows. 
What? I lost? 
Heh, I’m just a Team Rocket Grunt. I don’t know the password. Too bad for you. 
Oh, a kid? I don’t really like this, but eliminate you I must. 
I knew I’d lose... 
I got wiped out on the last mission by a kid, too. When we were abducting Pokémon, this kid with long red hair and mean-looking eyes just whomped me... 
You rotten little pest! 
Grrrr... 
Heh, only the one who guards the boss’s room knows the password for that door. Where’s the boss’s room? Who knows? Go look for yourself. 
... 
Hey, you’re good! 
Wow, strong! 
I...I couldn’t do a thing... Giovanni, please forgive me... 
I used to work for Silph, but now I run research for Team Rocket. A meddlesome child like you needs to be punished. 
A mere tactical error cost me... 
A radio signal that drives Pokémon mad... My experiment is a complete success. My promotion is assured. This loss means absolutely nothing. 
I don’t care that Pokémon are hurt by our experiment. 
Thinking is my strong suit, not battling. 
If we turn up the power of our radio signal for broadcast nationwide... The very thought excites me! 
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck! You’re challenging me to a battle? Hah! You’re nuts, but you have guts! I like that! If you can beat me, I’ll tell you a password to the boss’s room! 
The password for the boss’s door-- RATICATETAIL. 
The password for the boss’s door-- RATICATETAIL. But if you don’t have both passwords... Ha ha ha! 
Do I know the password? Maybe. But no weakling’s going to get it! 
The password for the boss’s door-- SLOWPOKETAIL. 
The password to the boss’s room is SLOWPOKETAIL. But it’s useless unless you have two passwords. 
My Pokémon just got a haircut! I’ll show you how strong it is! 
Aiyeeee! 
Your Pokémon will like you more if you give them haircuts. 
I think you have some rare Pokémon with you. Let me see them! 
Gah! I lost! That makes me mad! 
Are you making a Pokédex? Here’s a hot tip. You want to battle as many Trainers as you can when you see them on routes and in caves. Their Pokémon will be recorded in the Pokédex, and they’ll also make your Pokémon grow! 
I got booted out of the Game Corner. I kept winning at the new Coin game, and they thought I was cheating... 
...Grumble... 
I guess I have to do things fair and square... 
Do you consider the Pokémon types in battle? If you know about the different types of Pokémon, you’ll do better in battle. 
Ow, ow, ow! 
I know all the different types of Pokémon. But I only use one type. 
Fork over your goods! 
Mercy! 
Steal and sell! That’s basic in crime, kid! 
They ditched this project before they finished. I’m searching for leftover loot. 
So strong... 
The underground warehouse? What do you want to go there for? There’s nothing down there. 
Open one door, another closes. Bet you can’t get where you want to go! 
Uh-oh! I was sunk by indecision! 
I’m confused, too... I’m pretty sure that the green switch is the one to press last... I think? 
I don’t care if you’re lost. You show up here--you’re nothing but a victim! 
Urk! Yeah, think you’re cool, huh? 
You must have ice in your veins to call out Team Rocket. 
Kwa ha ha! Confounded by the doors, are we? I’ll let you in on a secret if you can beat me! 
Uwww... I blew it. 
All right. A hint! Look at the color of the door switches. You push a color switch, and the same color door opens up... 
Are you lost? No, you can’t be. You don’t have that scared look. I’ll give you something to be scared about! 
How could you? 
Go wherever you like! Get lost! See if I care! 
You’re not going any farther! I don’t show mercy to my enemies, especially not brats! 
Blast it! 
I lost... Please forgive me, Giovanni! 
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck! I remember you! You got me good at our hideout! 
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck! So that’s how you did it! 
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck! That was a blast! 
How did you get this far? I guess it can’t be helped. I’ll dispose of you. 
I got disposed of... 
Team Rocket will keep going, waiting for the return of Giovanni. We’ll do whatever it takes. 
Waaaarggh! I’m beaten! 
You! How dare you enter uninvited! 
S-strong! 
The Shrine ahead is home to the Master of our Dragon Tamer clan. You’re not allowed to just go in! 
You shouldn’t be in here! 
Oh yikes, I lost! 
Soon I’m going to get permission from our Master to use dragons. When I do, I’m going to become an admirable Dragon Tamer and gain our Master’s approval. 
It’s a stranger--someone we don’t know. 
Ouchies. 
It was like having to battle Lance. 
We fight as a team. Come back later with more Pokémon. 
Who are you? 
Meanie. 
We’ll tell on you. Master will be angry with you. 
You don’t have enough Pokémon. Come back when you have more. 
...! 
... 
Welcome to Viridian Forest. Enjoy my Bug-type Pokémon! 
That’s wonderful... 
Pretty impressive! I’m sure you can go anywhere with that skill! 
Shh! Be quiet! The bug Pokémon will run away! 
Phew... 
From Bug-type Pokémon come the sounds of munching on grass, walking on crunchy leaves, swimming in puddles... For bug Pokémon fans, knowing how to distinguish these sounds is key! 
Wow, that’s a HUGE Pokémon! ... ...What kind of Trainer?! 
I couldn’t catch it! 
Has anyone ever told you that from behind you look like a VENONAT? 
I’m sure that there’s nothing more efficient and beautiful in this world than a Bug-type Pokémon. 
I lost beautifully! 
If this is it, then I don’t mind losing! 
There are many people out there who prefer solid bug Pokémon over squishy bug Pokémon. 
Thanks for your hard work, my lovely Pokémon... 
Doesn’t matter what kind of Pokémon-- as long as you like them, they all look cute.  
What did you come all the way out here for, I wonder. 
I lost all the way out here... 
Trainers are everywhere. 
Hey, hey, you’re in my way! Right! 
I got kicked around... 
All right, please pass through! 
To beat the cold, try warm clothes and a hot drink! 
Argh, all the way out here! 
That was a hot battle! 
How do I feel about losing? It hurts! 
I’m not done measuring data! 
I-I didn’t win. 
It’s pure white in my head! 
Argh... I can’t do any more... 
Argh! 
You! I’ve been waiting for someone like you! 
Yep, just as strong as expected! 
That was a great fight! Don’t you agree? 
Right after learning it in class, I head outside to practice! 
I need to follow the textbook. 
I should be sure to record all of today’s mistakes in a notebook! 
My Bag is digging into my shoulders! When that happens, I like to take a break and have a battle! 
Feh. 
All right, guess I should carry my Bag again! 
How about you just slow down and give me the chance to defeat you! 
Looks like I’ve been beaten at my own game... 
Even though you’re so young, you have the spirit of battle within. You must have trained under a well-known master! 
Zac: Really, you want to battle us? You’ve got a lot of courage for someone so young. 
Zac: You weren’t bluffing... 
Zac: Your future looks promising. 
Zac: You... Please come back with more Pokémon. 
Jen: Huh? You’d like to go up against us? Great! 
Jen: You’re so much stronger than I thought. 
Jen: I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of Trainer you’ll become. 
Jen: If you’re looking to battle us, you have to have at least two Pokémon. 
Wait a moment! Come fight us! 
You did it... 
You came all the way from Johto? You must be very persistent! 
Peace! ... ...Huh? When you meet the unknown on a mountain road, all you want is peace, right? 
Peace--even though I lost! 
Exchanging lighthearted greetings with someone you don’t know... That’s the best thing about mountains! 
Youngster? Goodness, how rude! Call me Shorts Boy! 
That is...Fail Boy... 
Looks like I need a bit more training! 
Moe: Do I look weak? Don’t make me laugh! When I’m with Lulu, I’ve got a hundred times more courage! 
Moe: Uwaaaahhh... 
Moe: In short, you’re just too strong... 
Moe: You don’t have enough Pokémon to fight with us. 
Lulu: Moe and I make a great pair! You should prepare yourself! 
Lulu: Eeek! 
Lulu: Don’t you misunderstand this! It’s not that Moe’s weak, it’s that you’re too strong! 
Lulu: Uh-oh, you’ve got only one Pokémon. You can’t battle with us like that! 
I am but a Gentleman stopped on the road. Would you care to join me in a quick contest? 
You were very skillful. 
Stopping in the road for a battle isn’t rude. No matter what, I am a Gentleman first! 
Huh? The wind has changed direction! 
Phew... 
Since the wind has changed, I’ll lay low... 
BASABASABASABASABASA! 
Pyopyopyopyo... 
Chuun-Chuun? Chunchun! 
Vic: All right! I’ll be able to show off for Tara! 
Vic: Oh no, my plans! 
Vic: Tara’s already seen me humiliated... 
Vic: What is it? You want to battle? If you want to battle with us, you need more Pokémon, right? 
Tara: I love to look at my boyfriend’s face in profile while he’s battling! 
Tara: Oh no, oh no... 
Tara: Even though my boyfriend lost, he’s still wonderful. 
Tara: Oh? You’ve got only one Pokémon? OK, we’ll try again another time. 
Pokémon battles lure people in! 
My Pokémon bucket is empty! 
Really? Rather than always catching new Pokémon, it’s good to train them?  
It was nice talking to you, but now I’m here for a Pokémon battle! 
Tim: I’ll give you a little hint. Don’t you think my girlfriend’s much stronger than I am? 
Tim: You’re the strongest! 
Tim: If you’ve beaten her, you must be strong! 
Tim: Are you collecting Pokémon? You can’t fight us with just one Pokémon. 
Tim: Hey, you came back!  While we were waiting for you, we became much stronger! Well, she did. 
Sue: Women who don’t take love seriously and who are reckless might get hurt. 
Sue: Wa ha... 
Sue: That strength of yours... I’ve got it! Are you in love? 
Sue: Let’s have a Pokémon battle after you’ve gotten more than one Pokémon. 
Sue: A woman in love is impatient. But if she’s with her boyfriend, waiting is never a chore! 
Collect water! Don’t let the fire go out! Look out for wild Pokémon! Let’s go, Campfire! 
Pfuuuuhh... 
It doesn’t matter what kind of preparation you’ve done. If you lose, you lose. 
I can fit in a quick battle while I’m in the midst of preparing a meal! 
Oh, I’m hungry... 
I figured it would be easy to knock you out... 
Hey, you’re back! I haven’t eaten anything while I waited! 
Hey, hey, how about we bring out your Pokémon and mine for a battle? 
Oh, that’s too bad... 
The way you were walking with your Pokémon made me think that I could win. 
Why is it I always get the urge to whistle when walking through nature? 
Tweeee! 
Instead of communicating with Pokémon with words, you can communicate with them through whistling! 
All right, let’s get this Pokémon battle started! 
All right! That concludes today’s battle. 
Don’t relax just ’cause you won. Once you get home, you should do a full review! 
My weight puts me in the featherweight class! ...Huh? What do you mean that doesn’t sound very strong? 
I lost as lightly as a feather floats! 
Maybe I should lie and say I’m in the heavyweight class... 
I’m a stubborn featherweight. I’ve been waiting here for you! 
I can’t wait to go home and drop off my Bag! 
I was in too much of a hurry. 
Don’t rush, and take the road one step at a time. Great advice! 
It’s good to put what you learn to use immediately! 
I see. I see. 
All right! Next time, I won’t make any mistakes! 
I’ve made good use of the time I’ve been waiting and done a review! 
Do you have after-school study sessions? 
So strong... 
Maybe I should join your study sessions! 
We’re the twins Kay and Tia! Do you know which one I am? 
Tia and Kay both lost... 
Absolute truth--I’m Kay! Maybe... 
If you want to battle with us, you’ll need to bring more Pokémon! 
While you weren’t looking, Kay and Tia changed places. 
We’re the twins Kay and Tia! Do you know which one I am? 
Kay and Tia both lost... 
Maybe truth--I’m Tia! Absolutely! 
If you want to battle with us, you’ll need to bring more Pokémon! 
While you weren’t looking, Tia and Kay changed places. 
Hey, your Pokémon... Show me. Show me. Show me! 
Yay! That was great! 
When you battle Pokémon, you get to see a bunch of Pokémon you’ve never seen before. It’s so great! 
All right, Pokémon, time for a battle! 
Oh, well... 
It’s not that my Pokémon are weak! It’s that your Pokémon are too strong! 
You’re gonna lose! I’ve got a hunch! 
Maybe my hunch was a little off... 
You’re so cool! You don’t do anything halfway! 
Modding my Bike costs a bunch of money! I need a job! 
Argh. I failed! 
Bike? Oh, I was talking about my Bicycle! 
Hey, who told you you could ride up and down this road? 
Crash! 
See you later! Come back anytime! 
Hey! Do you think you could just pass through here without stopping? 
Parara parapara para-parara! My horn’s got a great melody to it, don’t you think? 
Paaraaraaaaa... 
I love this melancholy melody. It really suits me well... 
I’ll toughen you up. Now, you come along with me. 
All right, thanks! 
All right! That fighting yell was great! 
Hey hey hey! You’re in my way! IN MY WAY! 
I lost. I lost! 
Won’t you give it a try? Would you like to join my team? 
Hey, that’s a cool Bike you’re riding! 
Great job. 
I love the way you do battle, too! Consider me a fan! 
Vroom vroom! Baribaribaribaribari! What do you think of my engine imitation? 
Hnnff...hnnff... I’m out of breath... 
We don’t put out any exhaust fumes. We’re a biker club that’s kind to nature! 
Gaon gaooon! Buwaribaribaribari...! There, my engine imitation has evolved! 
Have you ever gone camping with Pokémon? 
You’re strong! 
If you forget your blanket when you go camping, you can snuggle up to a Pokémon and it’ll be just as warm! 
Are you in a hurry? How about a quick battle break? 
Aaahh...that’s it. 
Even though I lost, I had fun! 
When I was a kid, I only played inside the house. Now I love playing outside with Pokémon! 
Argh! 
If I’m with Pokémon, I don’t mind losing so much! 
Found it! A Trainer that I can enjoy fighting! 
I lost with all my strength! 
That was an incredible battle! I’ve got goose bumps! 
Hey, hey. Will you battle me? 
That was pretty incredible. 
You’re something special! 
I used to be a fisherman a while back. I’ve grown to love swimming so much, I’m always in my swim trunks! 
Ulp... 
Maybe I should go back to fishing... 
Phew! I’ve worn my best swim trunks today! 
Even if you’re wearing your best pants, if you don’t win--you just don’t win. 
All right! Next time I’ll wear party swim trunks! 
Look! It’s my very best swimsuit and my very best Pokémon! 
Ohhh! 
Your Pokémon--are you following the latest trend in teams? 
Mmph? Mmmph mmmmphh? Mmmmph mmmmmppphh!!! 
Pwah! 
I was trying to see how long I could hold my breath! 
Huh? I’ve caught a Trainer instead of a Pokémon! 
My fishing line got cut! 
It’s said that the Pokémon that escaped were huge. It’s the truth! 
Whoa! A nibble! ...Huh? A battle? OK, let’s go! 
If you try to chase two Pokémon, you won’t catch either one! 
I should’ve asked you to wait until I reeled that Pokémon in... 
Question is...did I become a fisherman because I’m patient, or did I get more patient because I’m a fisherman? 
Ummm... Hmmm... 
What’s the reason you became a Pokémon Trainer? 
I love bikinis! If I had an electric bikini, I could wear it even in winter! 
Awww... 
I suppose if you tried to swim in an electric bikini, you’d get a shock! 
Hey, Trainer! How about you put on a swimsuit, too? 
I didn’t want to lose... 
I wonder if there’s any place that sells swimsuits that suit my Pokémon? 
The teacher from the swimming class where I learned to swim had a face just like a POLIWHIRL. 
I’m sorry, Teacher... 
Due to the incredible resemblance, we called our teacher Professor POLIWHIRL! 
Swimming is a full-body exercise, so it’s really good for building strength! 
My Pokémon and I have no body strength... 
To win more, I need to work on my stamina! 
Surrounding yourself with bird Pokémon gives you the feeling that someday you might be able to fly, too! 
I couldn’t fly... 
I guess I just need to practice flapping my wings more! 
Bird Keepers are so wonderful with their bird Pokémon! 
I couldn’t handle it... 
We Bird Keepers think we’re using bird Pokémon. But somewhere along the line, the bird Pokémon started using us...  
Day: Are you going to beat us? 
Day: Waah! 
Day: You beat us... 
Day: If you want to battle Pokémon with us, you’ll have to bring more... 
Dani: We’ll knock you flat! 
Dani: Eeeeh! 
Dani: Looks like we got bounced. 
Dani: If you want to battle Pokémon with us, you’ll have to bring more... 
Walking along with luggage and your companion Pokémon gives a great feeling of outdoor life! 
Yaha! I lost! 
Are you also on a solo journey? See you again sometime. Bye for now! 
I’m headed out on a picnic. Do you know why? 
You are pretty good! 
The reason I’m going on a picnic... It’s because I really want to smell the fresh air... Do you know what I mean? 
Hey! Hugh! 
I mistook you for someone else... 
I came to explore Mt. Mortar, but I got separated from my partner... Did you run into a Trainer who uses a SEADRA? That SEADRA is really good at using Waterfall. 
Yo! Markus! 
Oops! I really mixed you up! 
I came to explore Mt. Mortar, but I got separated from my partner... Did you run into a Trainer who uses a SLOWPOKE? That SLOWPOKE is really good at using Strength. 
I’m not losing this time! 
I lost to some kid? 
A while back, this karate guy wanted to battle. He was ridiculously good. He just thrashed me silly. He said something about training and went in deeper. I wonder why? 
Were you really watching? 
Duff: Watching over my girlfriend makes my heart soar! 
Duff: I was no match for you... 
Duff: Thank you for the awe-inspiring battle! Bye! 
Duff: If you want to fight with us, you’ll need more than one Pokémon. 
Eda: My heart’s feelings for my boyfriend are as wide and deep as the ocean. 
Eda: You’re really something... 
Eda: You should really find a wonderful partner, too. 
Eda: Uh-oh. You’ve only got one Pokémon? 
Thom: One plus one is two. But the two of us together is much stronger! 
Thom: That wasn’t what I expected... 
Thom: It seems your power is impossible to predict! 
Thom: You should carry more Pokémon with you, right? 
Kae: The two of us aren’t just some boring pair! 
Kae: You’re unusual, too! 
Kae: I figured you were an ordinary lone Trainer. Boy, was I wrong! 
Kae: Didn’t you know you need at least two Pokémon to battle us? 
Longing for others is...what it is... But battles are battles, so let’s go! 
Wah ha ha! 
After a battle, you should always leave with a parting laugh! 
I’m not good with large crowds, so I’m camping out here with my Pokémon! Are you the same way? 
I should be headed deeper into the mountain, I guess... 
See ya! 
Did you see that, Clair? 
Oh, I see... 
Oh, you are a cute little Trainer! Why don’t you battle me? 
You’re good... 
Oh, I’ve learned something. There are people like you out there who are very skilled even though they’re young... 
Hey hey there, you young Trainer! Won’t you battle with me? 
Wow, you’re strong... 
You... I wonder what your future holds... 
Mmmmph... I just woke up. I couldn’t focus... 
What in the world was that? Don’t tell me some inexperienced kid can possibly be that strong! 
What was that? 
What in the world are you? 
Tweet!

Whoops! Sorry, but I have to do something else. Another time, OK?

Stop drawing funny faces! It hurts to laugh so much!

A battle? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s get our battle started!
Sorry! My Pokémon don’t seem to be feeling too well right now. Let me battle you another time.
If you want to battle, you need two Pokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower. 
Whoa! I can tell you’re pretty tough!
You used that move? That’s good strategy!
Way to go! That was an eye-opener!
Oh! How could you use that Pokémon in that situation?
You want to trade, huh? Sure, hold on just a second.
All right! Let’s trade!
Sorry! I don’t have a Pokémon I can trade right now. Let’s trade some other time.
Oh yeah! I really wanted this Pokémon!
Finally, I got that Pokémon I’ve wanted for such a long time.
You can’t trade if you have only one Pokémon with you. 
If you want to do something with me, just give me a shout!
You want to mix records with me? OK, I just need a little time.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s mix our records, then.
Oh, I’m sorry. I have too much to do right now. Another time, OK?

Oh, I’m sorry! Let’s draw another time!

Wow! You’re really good!
Ahaha! What is that?!
I love drawing! I can draw and draw!
Oops! I can’t stay inside the lines!
A battle? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
I’m terribly sorry, but my Pokémon aren’t feeling well... Let’s battle another time.
If you want to battle, you need two Pokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower. 
That Pokémon... It’s been raised really well!
That’s it! This is the right move now!
That’s awesome! You can battle that way?
You have exquisite timing for switching Pokémon!
A trade? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
I’m sorry, but I don’t have any Pokémon that I can trade now... Let’s trade some other time!
I’m trading Pokémon right now.
I finally got that Pokémon I wanted in a trade!
You can’t trade if you have only one Pokémon with you. 
If you want to do something with me, don’t be shy. Just ask!
You want to mix records? Sure! But I need a little time!
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
Oh, sorry! Let’s do this another time!
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We were just mixing our records. I know! [VAR(259, 1, 0)], would you like to mix your records with us, too?
Oh... Please come by anytime.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s mix some records!
Oh, sorry! Let’s do this another time!
It’s so fun to mix records!
I’m going to keep mixing!
Let’s mix it up!
I wonder what’s going to happen?
Spin Trade? Of course! OK, can you just wait a moment?
OK, all ready! Let’s get this Spin Trade started!
                     
If you want to join a Spin Trade, you need to bring an Egg, too. 
[VAR(259, 0, 0)]: We were doing Spin Trades just now. [VAR(259, 1, 0)], do you want to join us and do some Spin Trades, too?
Oh, OK. Come see us anytime!
OK! Let’s do a Spin Trade together!
                                             
                     
There is an Egg that cannot be traded in your party.
We’re doing Spin Trades!
Wah! It moved again!
There goes the Egg I wanted...
If it stopped there, I would’ve gotten a Berry.
Welcome to the Union Room. If there is anything you need help with, please let me know! [VAR(512, 0)]
How may I help you? [VAR(512, 0)]
Which topic would you like me to explain? [VAR(512, 0)]
In the Union Room, you may battle with two Pokémon of your choice that are Lv. 30 or lower. When you visit here, we recommend that you bring Pokémon that meet this requirement. 
You may trade your Pokémon with other players. Meeting new people could be a shortcut to meeting rare Pokémon! 
You may communicate with other players and mix your records. What will happen if you mix records, you ask? We recommend that you try it and see! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
In a Spin Trade, participants each bring an Egg for trading with others. Which Egg will you end up with? What kind of Pokémon is in that Egg? It’s quite exciting and fun! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
You may get together with others and draw. You all get to work on one sheet of paper at the same time. I’m sure a drawing made by friends will be a memorable masterpiece! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
You can chat with other people by selecting “CHAT” in the menu. Go out and meet other players in the Union Room! Let people know what you’re like and what you’d like to do. Mingle, chat, and add to your circle of friends! 
Oh! Here comes someone now! Instead of me, why not strike up a chat with our newcomer? 
                                  
Do you sometimes get mistaken for a real [VAR(270, 0, 0)]? I just seem to get that feeling from you. 
Hello! That’s right! It’s important to say a greeting! If someone arrives, let’s try to be friendly! 
Greetings! [VAR(284, 0, 0)]? It’s wonderful! I really like it, too! When you meet someone for the first time, the proper etiquette is to introduce yourself. By introducing yourself, you’ll get to know about the other person, too! 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)] Trainer? That’s what you are? Isn’t that something! But I’m sorry to say, I don’t have any Pokémon... I would rather watch than battle, you see. 
Oh! Your [VAR(284, 0, 0)]! I would love to have it! Please trade me! ... I was actually joking. I don’t have any Pokémon, so I can’t trade with anyone... 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? I can understand you’d want one... But you shouldn’t expect people to make trades just for you. You also have to consider what Pokémon the other person wants. 
Welcome to the Union Room! I’m the only one here now, but please do bring your friends for some fun and excitement! If you have time on your hands, I’m also here to chat. You see, I have a lot of time on my hands... 
I’m quite good at drawing! If it’s [VAR(284, 0, 0)], leave it to me! No one’s better than me at it! 
Oh, you’re leaving... ... It makes me feel lonesome... Please do come visit again! 
What’s wrong? Are you feeling down about something? If you’re feeling blue, it’s much better to have fun with friends than to be alone. 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? Yes, please! ...I do want to join in, but I’m on duty here, so I can’t... Sigh... [VAR(284, 0, 0)]... I wish I could... 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? Me, too, please! But I need to stay here and attend to our visitors... Please enjoy it with your friends! 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)]? You’re inviting me? Oh, but I have to stay here and attend to our visitors. I’m sorry. I’d love to accept, but I really can’t. 
That’s right! Sometimes, it might be better to just go and invite other people. But don’t get too selfish or pushy because you want to [VAR(284, 0, 0)]. 
Yes! It’s OK! Nothing is impossible. Think positively and keep your chin up! 
Everyone has at least one thing they aren’t good at. You should never try to make someone do what they don’t want to do. Incidentally, [VAR(284, 0, 0)] is something that I would like to do. 
Good luck! I hope you enjoy serious battles. You can’t experience ones like this in the Union Room! 
You want to chat? Well, you shouldn’t be wasting your time chatting with me. You need to be more active and talk to other players. After all, you can’t make friends if you don’t talk to people. 
Where are you? Um... Right before my eyes. Oh! Are you maybe an impostor? The real player is somewhere else? ...That’s ridiculous! Please, don’t be silly! My word! 
[VAR(284, 0, 0)] trade? That sounds fun! I would love to as well. But telling me that won’t help. I can’t trade with anyone. 
If you want to have a [VAR(284, 0, 0)] Battle, you need to be more assertive and talk to other players. If you can’t assert yourself, you may never get a chance at a [VAR(284, 0, 0)] Battle!

I have removed the boulder that was in the way, but it may still take some time to flatten the ground...
The roadwork is finally finished. Now I can go fishing again.
Sorry. This road is closed for construction. If you want to get to Cinnabar, you’d better go south from Pallet Town.
I’m all sweaty. Time for a swim!

You have to warm up before going into the water. That’s basic. 
        
                         
Hey, you’re young and fit! Don’t ride your Pokémon! Swim! 
      
                                 
Are you going to Cianwood? How about a quick battle first? 
        
                             
No inflatable tube for me. I’m hanging on to a sea Pokémon! 
             
                               
You can’t see it from here, but there is a big city called Cianwood across the sea.
I took the ship to go to Olivine for some sightseeing. I really liked the atmosphere. Being a port, it was nothing like the big cities.
Do you know what lies just past this gate? It’s the Battle Frontier! Every time I have a journey, I’ve raised mostly “useful” Pokémon. But now that I am here, I think I should have brought my “battle” Pokémon!
Hey! Great waves here! No one can resist such good waves! 
I see... You don’t have Surf yet... This is just between you and me... I got Surf from a man at Ecruteak, and I think he’s still there. Why don’t you try going there?

Pressing the pump hard will make it turn red, increasing its capacity. The circling WYNAUT can also help. Line a WYNAUT up with the pump to boost the air volume, but beware: lining up the pump with a skinny WYNAUT reduces the air volume.

Welcome to the Wi-Fi Plaza! This is the general-inquiries counter. 
What would you like to know about? 
                                                                                      
There is a giant globe located near the entrance of the Wi-Fi Plaza. The globe, named Visitor Profiles, shows the locations and the local times of visitors to the Wi-Fi Plaza. To see the visitors, check the panel that appears by pressing the A Button. You should also check the balloons that occasionally float by. 
Plaza News is an electronic display that shows occurrences in the Wi-Fi Plaza. If you’re unsure of what to do, please check the Plaza News. 
The Footprint Stamp is a panel where you can play with the footprints of the Pokémon in your party. There are two panels, black and white. Play with whichever one you want. 
                                                                          
We hope you’ll enjoy yourself in the Wi-Fi Plaza before your time is up. 
Tap Toys are toys that you can play with only in the Wi-Fi Plaza. Besides playing with them on your own, you can also share Tap Toys with friends. The Tap Toys can be powered up playing Plaza Games, too. We hope you’ll come up with your own ways of enjoying them! 
[VAR(768, 0, 0)] is one of the Plaza Games. Up to four players can take part. The rule is simple: just flick Berries into the mouth of a rotating SWALOT. The player with the highest score will be rewarded with a Tap Toy upgrade.

When your visiting time is almost up, the lighting is turned off. Then, fireworks displays are put on throughout the Wi-Fi Plaza. We hope you will enjoy the fireworks as your visit winds down. 
When your visiting time is up, Parade Floats appear from the right rear of the Wi-Fi Plaza. These Floats are vehicles modeled after Pokémon. You may get on a Float and return to the Pokémon Center yourself, or send off friends. Please be aware that once you get on a Float, you cannot get off till it exits the Wi-Fi Plaza, at which point you will be disconnected from Nintendo WFC. 
You may take part in a Plaza Survey using the machine next to the general-inquiries counter. For details, please ask the attendant by the monitor.

===============================
The seed on its back is filled with nutrients. The seed grows steadily larger as its body grows.
Exposure to sunlight adds to its strength. Sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger.
By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.
The flame on its tail shows the strength of its life force. If it is weak, the flame also burns weakly.
It is very hotheaded by nature, so it constantly seeks opponents. It calms down only when it wins.
If CHARIZARD becomes furious, the flame at the tip of its tail flares up in a light blue shade.
The shell is soft when it is born. It soon becomes so resilient, prodding fingers will bounce off it.
It is a well-established symbol of longevity. If its shell has algae on it, that WARTORTLE is very old.
It deliberately makes itself heavy so it can withstand the recoil of the water jets it fires.
For protection, it releases a horrible stench from the antennae on its head to drive away enemies.
Inside the shell, it is soft and weak as it prepares to evolve. It stays motionless in the shell.
It collects honey every day. It rubs honey onto the hairs on its legs to carry it back to its nest.
Its poison stinger is very powerful. Its bright-colored body is intended to warn off its enemies.
Although it is a cocoon, it can move a little. It can extend its poison barb if it is attacked.
It can take down any opponent with its powerful poison stingers. It sometimes attacks in swarms.
It usually hides in tall grass. Because it dislikes fighting, it protects itself by kicking up sand.
It has outstanding vision. However high it flies, it is able to distinguish the movements of its prey.
Its well-developed chest muscles make it strong enough to whip up a gusty windstorm with just a few flaps.
It eats anything. Wherever food is available, it will settle down and produce offspring continuously.
Gnaws on anything with its tough fangs. It can even topple concrete buildings by gnawing on them.
It flaps its short wings to flush out insects from tall grass. It then plucks them with its stubby beak.
It shoots itself suddenly high into the sky, then plummets down in one fell swoop to strike its prey.
It can freely detach its jaw to swallow large prey whole. It can become too heavy to move, however.
Transfixing prey with the face-like pattern on its belly, it binds and poisons the frightened victim.
This intelligent Pokémon roasts hard berries with electricity to make them tender enough to eat.
When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual.
If it fell from a great height, this Pokémon could save itself by rolling into a ball and bouncing.
In an attempt to hide itself, it will run around at top speed to kick up a blinding dust storm.
The poison hidden in its small horn is extremely potent. Even a tiny scratch can have fatal results.
When feeding its young, it first chews the food into a paste, then spits it out for the offspring.
Its body is covered with needle-like scales. It never shows signs of shrinking from any attack.
It is small, but its horn is filled with poison. It charges then stabs with the horn to inject poison.
It raises its big ears to check its surroundings. If it senses anything, it attacks immediately.
It swings its big tail around during battle. If its foe flinches, it will charge with its sturdy body.
The moonlight that it stores in the wings on its back apparently gives it the ability to float in midair.
With its acute hearing, it can pick up sounds from far away. It usually hides in quiet places.
As it develops, its single white tail gains color and splits into six. It is quite warm and cuddly.
Some legends claim that each of its nine tails has its own unique type of special mystical power.
If it inflates to sing a lullaby, it can perform longer and cause sure drowsiness in its audience.
Their fur feels so good that if two of them snuggle together, they won’t want to be separated.
While flying, it constantly emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings.
However hard its victim’s hide may be, it punctures with sharp fangs and gorges itself with blood.
Awakened by moonlight, it roams actively at night. In the day, it stays quietly underground.
What appears to be drool is actually sweet honey. It is very sticky and clings stubbornly if touched.
It has the world’s largest petals. With every step, the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen.
It is doused with mushroom spores when it is born. As its body grows, mushrooms sprout from its back.
It stays mostly in dark, damp places, the preference not of the bug, but of the big mushroom on its back.
Its eyes also function as radar units. It catches and eats small bugs that hide in darkness.
When it attacks, it flaps its large wings violently to scatter its poisonous powder all around.
Its skin is very thin. If it is exposed to light, its blood heats up, causing it to grow weak.
Its three heads bob separately up and down to loosen the soil nearby, making it easier for it to burrow.
It is fascinated by round objects. It can’t stop playing with them until it tires and falls asleep.
Many adore it for its sophisticated air. However, it will lash out and scratch for little reason.
It has mystical powers but doesn’t recall that it has used them. That is why it always looks puzzled.
When it swims at full speed using its long, webbed limbs, its forehead somehow begins to glow.
It is extremely ill-tempered. Groups of them will attack any handy target for no reason.
If approached while asleep, it may awaken and angrily give chase in a groggy state of semi-sleep.
It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It fearlessly stands up to bigger and stronger foes.
This legendary Chinese Pokémon is considered magnificent. Many people are enchanted by its grand mane.
Because it is inept at walking on its newly grown legs, it always  swims around in water.
The swirl on its belly subtly undulates. Staring at it may gradually cause drowsiness.
This strong and skilled swimmer is even capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean just by kicking.
It senses impending attacks and teleports away to safety before the actual attacks can strike.
It possesses strong spiritual power. The more danger it faces, the stronger its psychic power.
Closing both its eyes heightens all its other senses. This enables it to use its abilities to their extremes.
Always brimming with power, it passes time by lifting boulders. Doing so makes it even stronger.
It always goes at its full power, but this very tough and durable Pokémon never gets tired.
It quickly swings its four arms to rock its opponents with ceaseless punches and chops from all angles.
Even though its body is extremely skinny, it is blindingly fast when catching its prey.
Even though it is filled with acid, it does not melt because it also oozes a protective fluid.
Acid that has dissolved many prey becomes sweeter, making it even more effective at attracting prey.
When the tide goes out, dehydrated TENTACOOL remains can be found washed up on the shore.
Its 80 tentacles absorb water and stretch almost endlessly to constrict its prey and enemies.
Most people may not notice, but a closer look should reveal that there are many GEODUDE around.
With a free and uncaring nature, it doesn’t mind if pieces break off while it rolls down mountains.
It sheds its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens and crumbles away.
It is a weak runner immediately after birth. It gradually becomes faster by chasing after its parents.
At full gallop, its four hooves barely touch the ground because it moves so incredibly fast.
It lazes vacantly near water. If something bites its tail, it won’t even notice for a whole day.
If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off in a harsh battle, it reverts to being an ordinary SLOWPOKE.
It is attracted by electromagnetic waves. It may approach Trainers if they are using their Pokégear.
Three MAGNEMITE are linked by a strong magnetic force. Earaches will occur if you get too close.
If anyone tries to disturb where the essential plant stalks grow, it uses its own stalk to thwart them.
By alternately raising and lowering its two heads, it balances itself to be more stable while running.
It collects data and plans three times as wisely, but it may think too much and fall into a state of immobility.
Although it can’t walk well on land, it is a graceful swimmer. It especially loves being in frigid seas.
Its streamlined body has little drag in water. The colder the temperature, the friskier it gets.
As it moves, it loses bits of its body, from which new GRIMER emerge. This worsens the stench around it.
They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse.
It swims facing backward by opening and closing its two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast.
Once it slams its shell shut, it is impossible to open, even by those with superior strength.
With its gas-like body, it can sneak into any place it desires. However, it can be blown away by wind.
In total darkness, where nothing is visible, HAUNTER lurks, silently stalking its next victim.
It steals heat from its surroundings. If you feel a sudden chill, it is certain that a GENGAR appeared.
It twists and squirms through the ground. The thunderous roar of its tunneling echoes a long way.
If you think that you had a good dream but you can’t remember it, a DROWZEE has probably eaten it.
When it is very hungry, it puts humans it meets to sleep, then it feasts on their dreams.
If it senses danger approaching, it cloaks itself with bubbles from its mouth so it will look bigger.
It can hardly lift its massive, overgrown pincer. The pincer’s size makes it difficult to aim properly.
It rolls to move. If the ground is uneven, a sudden jolt from hitting a bump can cause it to explode.
It is dangerous. If it has too much electricity and has nothing to do, it amuses itself by exploding.
Their shells are very durable. Even if they crack, they can survive without spilling their contents.
Its three heads think independently. However, they are friendly and never appear to squabble.
If it is sad or lonely, the skull it wears shakes and emits a plaintive and mournful sound.
It has been seen pounding boulders with the bone it carries in order to tap out messages to others.
This amazing Pokémon has an awesome sense of balance. It can kick in succession from any position.
Its punches slice the air. However, it seems to need a short break after fighting for three minutes.
Its tongue has well-developed nerves that run to the very tip, so it can be deftly manipulated.
Its thin, filmy body is filled with gases that cause constant sniffles, coughs and teary eyes.
If one of the twin KOFFING inflates, the other one deflates. It constantly mixes its poisonous gases.
It is inept at turning because of its four short legs. It can only charge and run in one direction.
Its rugged hide protects it from even the heat of lava. However, the hide also makes it insensitive.
It walks carefully to prevent its egg from breaking. However, it is extremely fast at running away.
The vines that cloak its entire body are always jiggling. They effectively unnerve its foes.
If it is safe, the young gets out of the belly pouch to play. The adult keeps a close eye on the youngster.
If attacked by a larger enemy, it quickly swims to safety by adeptly controlling its well-developed dorsal fin.
An examination of its cells revealed the presence of a gene not found in HORSEA. It became a hot topic.
Its dorsal, pectoral and tail fins wave elegantly in water. That is why it is known as the water dancer.
During spawning season, SEAKING gather from all over, causing rivers to appear a brilliant red.
At night, the middle of its body slowly flickers with the same rhythm as a human heartbeat.
The middle section of its body is called the core. It glows in a different color each time it is seen.
A skilled mime from birth, it gains the ability to create invisible objects as it matures.
It slashes through grass with its sharp scythes, moving too fast for the human eye to track.
It rocks its body rhythmically. It appears to alter the rhythm depending on how it is feeling.
Electricity runs across the surface of its body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish-blue.
It dislikes cold places, so it blows scorching flames to make the environment suitable for itself.
With its pincer horns, it digs burrows to sleep in at night. In the morning, damp soil clings to its body.
They fight each other by locking horns. The herd’s protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.
