...Um... I think you’d feel a lot safer if you were to catch some more. 
                                                    
In Jubilife City, there’s the Trainers’ School, which... Well, you know. [VAR(259, 0)], you should visit it. You’ll get some tips on Pokémon. Oh yes, [VAR(259, 1)] went to the Trainers’ School earlier. OK, bye now! 
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 1)]! How many Pokémon have you caught? 
Whoa! You already have [VAR(306, 0)] Pokémon with you! 
Huh? I think you should catch some more. It might be more of a challenge raising a lot of Pokémon... But it’s worth it. The more Pokémon you have, the happier you’ll be. 
                                                         
In Jubilife City, there’s the Trainers’ School. Check it out, [VAR(259, 0)]. Oh yeah, [VAR(259, 1)] went to the Trainers’ School earlier. OK, see you around! Work hard on your Pokédex! 
Jubilife City’s built on land they carved out of a mountain. The people and Pokémon of Oreburgh City helped out with that undertaking.
Hello! Let me ask you, have you paid a visit to the TV station? If you’ve never been, you owe it to yourself to make the trip. And, if you’ve been there before, it never hurts to visit again. After all, you can be a star! Or at least dream of being one!
Jubilife City is the love of my life. Words can’t do it justice. 
By the way, have you visited the Trainers’ School? Not yet, right? You really must visit there! 
                                          
By the way, have you participated in the Pokétch campaign? Not yet, right? You really must try! 
Hello! Yes, you! You with that cool scarf! You should have seen the boy that came running by earlier. He ran past me so quickly, I couldn’t even manage a hello.
Jubilife City is a big place. Take your time sightseeing.

Oh, oh, oh? You call yourself a Pokémon Trainer? And yet you have no Pokétch? That is, Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch for short! Oh my, you are a rare case indeed! 
You see, I invented, and now manufacture, Pokétches. Not only that, I’m now conducting the Pokétch promotional campaign! All you have to do is find three clowns in Jubilife City. If you can find them... I will gift you with a Pokétch!
The three clowns will each ask you a skill-testing question. The questions will all have to do with Pokémon. After all, a Pokétch is a tool for Pokémon Trainers. Collect a Coupon from each clown, then come see me, OK?
OK, let me count your Coupons! I’ll use the Pokétch here... One, two, three! Bravo! I say, bravo! In return for these Coupons, I present you this Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch for short! 
[VAR(259, 0)] received a [VAR(65280, 1)]Pokétch[VAR(65280, 0)]![VAR(512, 1)]
You can add apps to your Pokétch to make it even more versatile! Touch the Pokétch screen and please do try it out! 
Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown! Let’s roll out my question! Does a Pokémon grow by defeating others and gaining Exp. Points?
Ding-ding! You’re absolutely correct! 
Bzzzzt! That’s the wrong answer...
Pokémon grow stronger by defeating other Pokémon in battle. Some Pokémon even grow into an entirely different form in a process known as evolution.

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown! Let’s roll out my question! Just like Pokémon types, the moves of Pokémon also have types?
Ding-ding! You’re absolutely correct! 
Bzzzzt! That’s the wrong answer...
If the Pokémon’s type matches its move’s type, that move is made much more powerful!

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown! Let’s roll out my question! Can a Pokémon hold an item?
Ding-ding! You’re absolutely correct! 
Bzzzzt! That’s the wrong answer...
A Pokémon may hold a single item. Some items become effective as soon as they are held by a Pokémon. Berries are eaten by Pokémon as necessary during battle. 
Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon! 
Hi, there. You should stick around. We’re doing a Pokétch campaign soon. Before it starts, I think you should brush up at the Trainers’ School.

Rowan: Ah, [VAR(259, 0)]. Impeccable timing as always. These miscreants are babbling utter nonsense that I just can’t stomach. Show them some manners, if you will. 
Mystery man: Oh, Professor Pokémon, must you be so difficult? We are approaching you strictly as businessmen. All you must do is provide us with all your research findings. In return, we’ll refrain from causing massive damage to your assistant. 
Dawn: [VAR(259, 1)]! Let’s battle together and teach these horrible men a lesson! 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1)]! Join me and battle these guys! 
Grunt: You leave us no option. We will retreat for now. Because Team Galactic is benevolent to all, we shall leave. 
Rowan: That lot... They called themselves Team Galactic. When Pokémon evolve, they seem to release some type of energy... However, I believe that it’s a mystic power far beyond our control. But Team Galactic seems to be trying to use that power for something... Anyway, [VAR(259, 0)], well done! You battle quite capably. The sight of you Trainers and Pokémon battling together... I made the right decision in entrusting you with a Pokédex! 
                                  
                         
                                                  
Dawn: [VAR(259, 1)], did you know? The professor studies the evolution of Pokémon, too. According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon are somehow tied to evolution! I guess that means some Pokémon must undergo startling evolutions. So, [VAR(259, 1)]... Let’s keep working on our Pokédex project for the professor! 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1)], did you know about this? The professor studies about the evolution of Pokémon, too. According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon are somehow tied to evolution!

Contained within that Fashion Case... You will find a whole spectrum of chic Accessories and tasteful Backdrops! Dress up your Pokémon and watch their appeal grow! And, right now the TV station is offering its facilities so visitors can dress up their Pokémon! There are also prize giveaways, too! Please do visit our TV station! 
The way you look... You’re obviously a Trainer! Can you tell me what type of Pokémon you like?
The Fire type? You must have a fiery personality.
A person that likes the Water type must be somewhat cool.
You chose the Grass type? No wonder you look so calm.
Did you see me on TV? I was in an interview!
When you walk with your Pokémon, they gradually grow friendlier.
OK, set six Poké Balls in my belt... Yeah, that’ll do it. At most, you can have six Pokémon with you.
                                                         
Hiya, where’d you come from? ... Twinleaf Town, huh... It’s a nice place. Quiet and all. Jubilife City is a big place, so it might be a bit of a shock to you.
Hello, Trainer! Do you know much about Pokémon?
Ah, I see! You are knowledgeable! I imagine you wouldn’t see the need to visit the Trainers’ School, then. But do visit if you have the time. You may discover something new!
Oh, you’re not knowledgeable... But not to worry! There’s the Trainers’ School. The school will teach you the basics of Pokémon.
Past here is the GTS, which stands for Global Trade Station. Oh, I’m sorry, you don’t have any Gym Badges. The GTS is off-limits if you don’t have a Gym Badge. Sorry!

In the Union Room upstairs, you can chat and trade with other people. And that’s not all you can do. Check it out!
You can still catch a Pokémon if you already have six traveling with you. It automatically gets sent to the PC network in Pokémon Centers. Knowing that, I can keep on catching more and more Pokémon! It’ll make it more fun to check the PC in any Pokémon Center!

You may trade Pokémon one of two ways at the GTS. You may offer a Pokémon for trade, or search among offered Pokémon. Should I describe things in greater detail?
You will be asked to put up the Pokémon you are offering to trade. At that time, you will be asked what Pokémon you would like in return. If another player offers your desired Pokémon in return for your offered Pokémon, the trade will go through. Should I explain anything else?
You may search among the Pokémon that are offered by other Trainers. They will all identify what Pokémon their Trainers want back in return. If you find one that you want, you must provide us with the kind of Pokémon wanted in return. Should I explain anything else?
Would you like to make a global Pokémon trade?
Please do visit again.
I hope you enjoy your visit to the GTS! 
Wow... Uh-oh! I’m sorry, but your team and all your PC Boxes are full. If you wish to use the GTS, you must have room on your team or in a PC Box.
...Uh-oh! You only have one Pokémon with you. If you wish to use the GTS, you must have at least two Pokémon with you. Please come back with more Pokémon on your team.
That’s a big globe, eh? Where do I live on it now? Let’s see if I can point it out...
They say if you communicate with someone, their location is recorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon here to trade. Who knows, it might be traded while I’m asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with Pokémon fans around the world. Isn’t that something?
You can register where you live on this giant globe. Once you do, your location will be displayed to anyone you communicate with.
Is Nintendo WFC something even I can use easily? If it is really that easy, I’d love to trade Pokémon, too!

[VAR(259, 1)]: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)]! Did you come to study, too? I went ahead and memorized everything that was up on the blackboard. After all, it’s the Trainer’s job to avoid having their precious Pokémon hurt in battle, right? So, [VAR(259, 0)], what brings you? Huh? You’ve got something for me? 
[VAR(259, 0)] delivered the Parcel.
[VAR(259, 1)]: So, what is this...? Score! It’s a Town Map! Huh?! Why are there two in here? I like it a lot, but I don’t need two. Here, [VAR(259, 0)], you take one! 
[VAR(259, 1)]: Hmm... Well, according to the Town Map, I guess Oreburgh City is where I should be going next. There’s a Gym, so it’d be perfect for raising the Pokémon I just caught. Well, I’m on the road to becoming the greatest Trainer of all time! See you around! 
You just became a Trainer, did you? You should look up topics that you’re not familiar with.
                             
We learned about Pokémon types today. Umm... Grass is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to Water, and Water is weak to Grass! I think that’s how it goes!
Pokémon are smart enough to use items they’re holding. But they won’t know what to do with man-made items like Potions and Antidotes.
I wrote an essay in my notebook on  what makes a true Pokémon Trainer.
Doing it is the best way to learn! Can we get a battle with you?
Go! My Pokémon, go! 
Aww! But battling is the best way to learn about Pokémon!
It’s hard to win if you don’t have some Pokémon to choose from.
Whew! You’re really good! We’ve been studying every day, but we were no match at all! You’d be able to use this Technical Machine properly. Here you go! 
A Technical Machine, or TM for short, contains a Pokémon move. Using a TM, you can instantly teach its move to a Pokémon. But remember--a TM is good for one use only. Don’t waste it!
I just became friends with my Pokémon. I’m not sure if we can do this properly, but may we battle?
I need to try the things I learned before I forget them! 
Boo! Where’s your sense of adventure? Don’t be shy about talking to people and getting into battles!
Do you think we would have done better if I used Potions?
We were actually confident that we would do pretty good. But I’m completely impressed by how tough you are. If you’d like, talk to my friend and get a Technical Machine from him.
The blackboard lists status changes that may affect Pokémon in battle. 
Which would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP. The effects of poison remain after a battle. A poisoned Pokémon’s HP will drop while it is traveling. Heal a poisoning using an Antidote. 
If a Pokémon becomes paralyzed, its Speed stat drops. In addition, it may not be able to move while it is in battle. Paralysis remains after battle. Cure it using a Parlyz Heal. 
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if a battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. Wake it up using an Awakening. 
A burn reduces the Attack stat and steadily reduces the victim’s HP. A burn lingers after battle. Cure a burn using a Burn Heal. 
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless. The Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if a battle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal. 
It’s a notebook filled with writing. Let’s see... Pokémon are to be caught using Poké Balls. Up to six Pokémon can accompany a Trainer. A Trainer is someone who catches Pokémon, raises them, and battles with them. A Trainer’s mission is to defeat the strong Trainers who await challengers in Pokémon Gyms.

[VAR(259, 0)]: Yeah, yeah, you’re just a bit better than me, as usual. But listen up! Let me tell you who’s going to take on the Pokémon League and become the Champion. You guessed right! It’s going to be me! Anyways, you should be able to take the Gym Leader here. Hurry up and go make the challenge! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: Hey! That’s the Mine Badge! Good going! You’re tough enough to consider becoming the Pokémon Champ. Of course, I’m tougher, so it’s not going to actually happen. Anyways, [VAR(259, 1)], come with me to the library. 
Rowan: ! ...That tremor... That wasn’t a natural occurrence.

Rowan: ! ...That [VAR(259, 0)]... Can’t sit still... [VAR(259, 1)], I’m worried about Lake Valor. But I have no idea what is taking place. You must find out! But before you go, let me stress: don’t get in over your head. We will try to join you as soon as we inspect Lake Verity. 
Dawn: ...[VAR(259, 0)], you’ll be OK, won’t you?
Lucas: Lake Valor... I wonder what happened?
Dawn: We’re going off to Lake Verity first... Don’t do anything rash if something does happen.
Lucas: We’re going to investigate Lake Verity before we join you. Don’t try to be a hero if anything crazy happens.
Rowan: Hmm... What is taking place at Lake Valor... You must find out! But before you go, let me stress: don’t get in over your head. We will try to join you as soon as we inspect Lake Verity.
What’s up? Your clothes look damp. Were you swimming at the beach right by Sandgem Town?
The tremor earlier... It didn’t feel like an earthquake. It felt more like an explosion. 
Welcome to Canalave City, the Canal City! In the old days, this port used to be a hub of cargo transportation.
What was that tremor? I thought Mt. Coronet erupted!
I’m going to study at the library. I love reading. I love how reading takes me to places far away in time and space.
An explosion at Lake Valor? But there isn’t anything there?
My PSYDUCK is very close to me. It can use the move Return!
E-even PS-PSYDUCK’s Future Sight couldn’t foretell that tremor!
PSYDUCK: Gua?
PSYDUCK: Gua! Gua! Gwa? Guaa! Guuagwa?!
The Gym Leader and Trainers of this Gym often go out to Iron Island. They not only train their Pokémon, but they work out as well.
I’m flabbergasted!
Do you wanna set sail?
Anchors aweigh! 
You just tell me whenever you need to set sail!
Ahoy! You just go on and tell me whenever you want to set sail again!
I’ve lost my love of sailing since my son fell into that horrid nightmare... I need the Lunar Wing from Fullmoon Island to awaken him! Would you go to Fullmoon Island for me? If not for me, then for my son?
We’re both counting on you! Only you can awaken my son from his awful nightmare... Please, I need the Lunar Wing from Fullmoon Island to awaken him! 
Do you need to get ready? I’ll be waiting here. We’re desperate for your help.
That Lunar Wing... Please! Take it to my son...

Ah! That’s Oreburgh’s Gym Badge! I see, I see! You’ve defeated my son. But that’s no surprise. He still has much to learn. In place of my son Roark, I, Byron, will take your challenge! 
You were strong enough to take down my prized team of Pokémon. In recognition of that power, I give you this: the Mine Badge! 
[VAR(259, 0)] received the Mine Badge from Byron!
Having the Mine Badge enables you to use the hidden move Strength anytime outside of battle. And you now have six Gym Badges. That means all Pokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you without question. Here! Take this, too! 
That [VAR(264, 0)] contains the move [VAR(262, 1)]. If it hits, it may also lower the target’s Special Defense.
Gwahahahaha! The Sinnoh region is vast! Tough Trainers like you and [VAR(259, 1)] crop up constantly to challenge the old guard! With more young Trainers like my son and you two taking charge, the future of Pokémon is bright! But I’m not stepping aside just yet! I merely need to rededicate myself to training on Iron Island.
Hey, there! Champ-to-be! The Gym Leader here uses Steel-type Pokémon. Steel-type Pokémon have high Defense, so you’d have to hit them hard!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve beaten the Gym Leader! Good going! That makes it six Gym Badges! I tell you what, you’re really turning into one fine Trainer. If you were to say you’re going to try to become the Pokémon Champ... No one’d laugh at you now! I’m in your corner, kiddo!

Rowan: ... ... ... ... ... ... 
[VAR(259, 0)]: ...OK... I get it... 
Rowan: Hm! Everyone’s here finally. [VAR(259, 0)], everyone, listen. You may have forgotten already, but I study the evolution of Pokémon. 
But the more I study, the more mysteries appear and multiply. Pokémon that evolve, and those that don’t... What makes them different from each other? Do those that are immature as living beings evolve to ones more mature? If so, what do we make of the legendary Pokémon that don’t evolve? Are we to assume that the legendary Pokémon are complete as creatures? 
This is where you three come in. In the three lakes of Sinnoh, there are said to be mirage Pokémon. If we can obtain data on them, it may shed some light on how the process of Pokémon evolution works. I need help from each one of you on this grand undertaking. Help me find these Pokémon that are considered to be mirages. 
[VAR(259, 0)]: What are you saying? I didn’t get no Pokédex! 
Rowan: ...And who was it that bolted from the lab before I had a chance to give you a Pokédex? But that’s water under the bridge! Seeing Pokémon with your own eyes is important for you in becoming a better Trainer, too. 
Dawn: You can count on me! It will help with my Pokédex, too. [VAR(259, 0)], you’ll go too, won’t you? 
Lucas: You bet, Professor! This will add to the Pokédex database and help advance your research. 
Rowan: Hm! I would have made all of you go regardless... Anyway. Now, there are three lakes. Fortuitously, there are three of you. You should therefore split up and investigate the lakes individually. 
Rowan: Dawn, you go to Lake Verity. 
Dawn: Will do! 
Rowan: Lucas, you go to Lake Verity. 
Lucas: Yes, sir! 
Rowan: [VAR(259, 0)], I want you to investigate Lake Acuity. That would take you almost to Snowpoint City. The road there is harsh. I need a tough Trainer to go. 
[VAR(259, 0)]: Uh... Yeah, of course! Gramps, you know how to call it! You can tell I’m the hotness! 
Rowan: And that leaves [VAR(259, 0)] with Lake Valor. The lake is between Veilstone and Pastoria, if memory serves... 
Rowan: ... ...Has it stopped? Are all of you unharmed? Let’s go outside, but be careful. I’m concerned about the city. 
Rowan: [VAR(259, 1)], hurry along. But beware of aftershocks.

“Sinnoh Region’s Mythology” Long ago, when Sinnoh had just been made, Pokémon and humans led separate lives. That is not to say they did not help each other. No, indeed they did. They supplied each other with goods, and supported each other. A Pokémon proposed to the others to always be ready to help humans. It asked that Pokémon be ready to appear before humans always. Thus, to this day, Pokémon appear to us if we venture into tall grass.

Those not taken as food, he discarded, with no afterthought. The following year, no Pokémon appeared. Larders grew bare. ...Would you like to keep reading?
The young man, seeking the missing Pokémon, journeyed afar. Long did he search. And far and wide, too, until one he did find. Asked he, “Why do you hide?” To which the Pokémon replied... “If you bear your sword to bring harm upon us, with claws and fangs, we will exact a toll. “From your kind we will take our toll, for it must be done. “Done it must be to guard ourselves and for it, I apologize.” ...Would you like to keep reading?
To the skies, the young man shouted his dismay. “In having found the sword, I have lost so much. “Gorged with power, I grew blind to Pokémon being alive. “I will never fall savage again. This sword I denounce and forsake. “I plead for forgiveness, for I was but a fool.” So saying, the young man hurled the sword to the ground, snapping it.

“Sinnoh Folk Story 2” There lived a Pokémon in a forest. In the forest, the Pokémon shed its hide to sleep as a human. Awakened, the human dons the Pokémon hide to roam villages.
“Sinnoh Folk Story 3” There once were Pokémon that became very close to humans. There once were humans and Pokémon that ate together at the same table. It was a time when there existed no differences to distinguish the two.
On this floor, you will find many books on the myths and legends of the Sinnoh region.

So, I’m going back to Jubilife City. Next stop, the Eterna Gym Badge! Ten seconds before I dash! Nine... Bah! Who’s got time to count?! 
Howdy, Trainer! If you don’t have a single Gym Badge, other Trainers will look down on you like you’re a total noob, right? So, I’ll show you where the town’s Pokémon Gym is. 
Huh? There’s someone there.
Is that guy in front of the Gym your friend? He’s sort of twitchy and impatient.
Oh, hi, you’re back! The Gym Leader’s waiting for you.

The Gym Leader went off to work in the mine.
The Gym Leader is young, but he’s the mine’s safety supervisor. He’s an expert in more than just one field!
Everyone’s proud of the mine. They’re digging for coal under the sea as we speak... It’s amazing how they do it!
Up ahead there’s a huge mountain that towers above everything. It divides Sinnoh into two distinct halves.
Have you seen the vents? They release steam from down below.
                              
These vents exchange the hot air down below with the fresh air outside. Looking down them gives me the urge to start yelling into ’em! Hello!
There’s no question. This is hard, hard work. But working alongside Pokémon... It gives me a boost somehow. Here, take one of these. 
Feeling hale and hearty puts a smile on my face. And that makes me happy.
This pile of dirty sand is called a slag heap. It’s the waste from sorting coal.
Chop, chop, MACHOP! Chop, chop away on rocks! ~♫
TMs are single use only, but HMs can be used over and over. It’s tricky trying to decide which Pokémon should learn what moves.

Welcome! This is the Oreburgh Pokémon Gym! I’m Roark, the Gym Leader! I’m but one Trainer who decided to walk proudly with Rock-type Pokémon! As the Gym Leader, I need to see your potential as a Trainer. And, I’ll need to see the toughness of the Pokémon that battle with you! 
This is embarrassing... I went and lost to a Trainer who didn’t have a single Gym Badge... But that’s tough. You were strong, and I was weak. That’s all there is. According to Pokémon League rules, I have to give you our Gym Badge since you’ve beaten me, the Leader. Here’s your official Pokémon League Coal Badge. 
[VAR(259, 0)] received the Coal Badge from Roark!
Having that Coal Badge means your Pokémon can now use the hidden move Rock Smash outside of battle. You should also take this, too. 
That [VAR(264, 0)] contains the move Stealth Rock. It’s a move that inflicts damage on foes that switch into battle. Incidentally, a TM will teach its move to a Pokémon instantly. But a TM will break when you use it, so make certain you want a Pokémon to learn that move.
In this region of Sinnoh, there are seven other Gym Leaders. I should warn you--they’re a lot tougher than I am!
Howdy! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? That’s what I said to a really impatient boy earlier, too. The Gym Leader is a user of Rock-type Pokémon. Well, listen. Rock-type Pokémon really hate water, all right? They’re also weak to Grass-type moves. Gee, they sure have weaknesses! But don’t think it will be easy. You don’t get to be a Gym Leader without covering for weaknesses. Going after a Rock-type Pokémon with a Fire-type Pokémon won’t be easy, either. That’s all the advice I can give. Thanks for listening!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve taken care of the Gym Leader! So, did my advice come in handy or what? If my advice was useful, it’d be great if you’d become my fan!

Yay! I got a Pal Pad at the Pokémon Wi-Fi Club downstairs!
Switch on the PC at any Pokémon Center and connect to the Pokémon Storage System. That’s all you need to do to store or bring out your Pokémon.
Hmmm... What is your favorite kind of Trainer? Can you tell me? 
Which kind of Trainer would you like to be?
[VAR(270, 0)] is the kind of Trainer you want to be?
I see! So [VAR(270, 0)] is the kind of Trainer you like. If that’s the case, others may come to see you in the same way. 
OK, then I’ll just talk to you later!
Hello! You’ve been mistaken for [VAR(270, 0)], haven’t you? But I think you can also pass for a different kind of Trainer. So, how about telling me what kind of Trainer that you like?

There are eight Gym Leaders in the Sinnoh region. The objective for Trainers is to get Gym Badges from them all.
A Gym Leader isn’t just like any Trainer you meet. I’d take as many Pokémon as possible if I were you.
                  
                      
Roark lets us train our Pokémon in the mine.

Giving nicknames to Pokémon is the way to go. It makes you feel as if they’re your very own.
But he named our PSYDUCK “Yellow” just because of its color... I don’t understand the logic behind that at all.
Are you catching Pokémon? Here, take this if you’d like. 
The Dusk Ball is a Poké Ball designed for use in darkness. It works better if you use it at night or in a cave.
Yellow: Duuuck?

===============================
Text File: 65
===============================
Do you make your Pokémon hold items? If you’d like, let one hold this [VAR(264, 0)]. 
That [VAR(264, 0)] intensifies the power of Rock-type moves. Unfortunately, none of my Pokémon can use Rock-type moves, so...
PSYDUCK: Duuuck?

Hahaha! I’m gonna swipe your Flag!

Listen, listen. Do you have a Pokémon called MACHOP? Would you be willing to trade your MACHOP for my ABRA?
Be nice to my ABRA! I’ll be sure to look after your MACHOP in return!
What I asked for was a MACHOP...
Oh, OK... Well, I can’t make you trade me. But if you change your mind, I’ll be right here waiting!
Thanks to Pokémon, I got to be friends with you!
A Pokémon obtained in a trade grows quickly. But if a Pokémon grows too much, it will often ignore the Trainer. Of course, it won’t matter if you have lots of Gym Badges.

All Pokémon have a special power called an ability.
How my Pokémon and I are alike... It’s not anything I can explain easily.
The view is good from up here, but it’s a pain going out. If you don’t mind, how about showing me a Pokémon called ZUBAT?
The view is good from up here, but it’s a pain going out. If you don’t mind, how about showing me a Pokémon called ZUBAT? Oh! That Pokémon! That’s a ZUBAT! Wow, that’s cool... It’s so cute... That does it! I’ll go out and catch Pokémon, too! Thank you, my friend! This is a token of my thanks! 
Yeah, there are so many kinds of Pokémon out in the world. I want to see them all now!

Hello! Welcome to the Oreburgh Mining Museum!
Hello, hello! How are you? I study Pokémon Fossils! Me! Right here and now! 
You have a Fossil for me, yes? Shall I turn it into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I turn back into a Pokémon? Choose! Now!
OK, I will do that! Turn that Fossil back into a Pokémon, surely I will!
You don’t wish that I extract any Pokémon from a Fossil. Fine, then!
I am in the process of extracting your Pokémon from a Fossil. You go outside, yes, please. Now! Time alone is what I now need. NOW!!!
You were gone too long! You kept us waiting! Unacceptable! This is your [VAR(256, 0)]! You be good to it, OK! 
[VAR(259, 0)] received the [VAR(256, 1)]! 
Give a nickname to the [VAR(256, 1)] you received?
But, no, I cannot do this! You have too many Pokémon with you! I must hold it for you, so come back, you, and take it away, please.
If it is a Fossil that you obtain, bring it to me if you must.
On the verge of a breakthrough, I am, to achieve extraction from Fossils. From Fossils I can extract Pokémon, but not yet, not yet.
Whoa! So this is coal? I never expected something this big!
Wow! The Pokémon that carried this must be terribly strong!
Well, how about that! The Oreburgh Mine extends under the seafloor!
How Coal Is Made   1 “In a time long before history, vegetative matter was swept along by rain and rivers. It came to be buried under the ground.”
How Coal Is Made   2 “The buried plant matter was forced ever deeper under the ground due to tremors and fissures caused by the shifting landmasses.”
How Coal Is Made   3 “Deep under the ground, the plant matter was subjected to heavy pressure and the heat of magma. It gradually turned into coal.”
Samples of coal from different regions are displayed.
The box contains categorized samples of coal.
Different kinds of lamps are displayed. They appear to have been worn on someone’s head while underground.
Badly scarred wooden tools are displayed. They apparently dug out coal using these tools in the olden days.
The everyday items and tools of past mine workers are displayed.

Have you ever seen or heard about differently colored Pokémon? For instance, a regular PIKACHU has a yellow body, correct? Well, the different-colored PIKACHU has a sort of orange body.
You know how Pokémon have different natures like we have personalities? I don’t think it’s surprising to see Pokémon in different colors.
PIKACHU: Pikaaah!

Hiya! Your Pokémon could use some toughening up. Why not try training in the Oreburgh Mine?
I always have a rotten time trying to decide which moves my Pokémon should learn.
You remind me so much of the time I got my first Pokémon.

===============================
The Oreburgh Mine is operated with the utmost care. We avoid causing any damage to the natural habitats of Pokémon.
Wow... Your Pokémon’s eyes are twinkling brightly! Seeing that makes me happy! Here, I want you to have this! 
You know how Pokémon stay inside their Poké Balls? I try to think about what would be the best Poké Balls for them.
                                                 
The whole system of taking the coal out of the mine is automated. There’s nothing backbreaking about it!

Oh, is that a Pokédex? You must be helping Professor Rowan? What’s your name? ... OK, hello, [VAR(259, 0)]. I’ll be sure to remember that name! My name is Cynthia. I’m a Trainer just like you. I’ve been studying Pokémon mythology lately, just out of curiosity. 
Here in Eterna City, there is a statue of an ancient Pokémon. According to myth, it was an extremely powerful Pokémon. Who knows? You may encounter something like it while you’re traveling with your Pokédex. Try using this. It should help you on your way. 
Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move Cut can be used in the field. It will let you go places that were previously inaccessible to you. That’s important for filling up your Pokédex, right? Then luck be with you, young Trainer! 
Hey! You there, kid! Stay away from that Pokémon statue! Team Galactic is conducting an official investigation here!
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer! Errr... It’s OK. Never mind. You look tough. I won’t take... Um, I’ll just let you keep your Pokémon. Carry on!
Have you seen our building? Team Galactic is so stinking rich that we can have one built instantly!
Since that Team Galactic building went up, the city’s atmosphere has gotten all creepy and tense. I don’t know what those people are doing up in that place...
With Team Galactic gone, what’s going to happen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his favorite Pokémon away. I don’t think he’s telling the truth. Team Galactic looks so cool. They don’t look like common thugs.
Do you use Bike stands? It looks so cool to hop off your Bike and then lean on it. It looks so smooth!
If you’re visiting Eterna, you need to get yourself a Bicycle and take a ride down the Cycling Road.
                                                                 
They say this is an old city. It doesn’t look it, though. Not with all these tall buildings.
Eterna City’s not anything like it was before, way back in the day.
They say this is a Pokémon that lived long, long ago.
Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have an Explorer Kit? You should have a word with the man next door to the Pokémon Center. 
Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have an Explorer Kit? You should have a word with the man next door to the Pokémon Center.

Gardenia: At my Gym, no one gets to battle with the Gym Leader--me--until they’ve beaten all the other Trainers. I’ll be waiting for you in the back. Good luck, challenger! 
Hey, there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? Actually, that’s what I said to some boy who zipped in here earlier, too! The Gym Leader, Gardenia, is a user of Grass-type Pokémon. It should be obvious, but Grass-type Pokémon really hate fire. Oh, wait a second. I should tell you about the Gym itself first. You can’t challenge the Gym Leader until you find and beat all the Gym’s Trainers who’ve hidden themselves. It’s a bit challenging, but just think of it as good training and go for it!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve beaten the Gym Leader! Your Pokémon look much tougher than when they went in, too! At least that’s how I see it!

You kept me waiting! I’m Eterna’s Gym Leader, Gardenia, the Grass-type master! When I first saw you, I was convinced you’d find your way to me. My hunch was right on the money. You have a winning aura about you. So, anyway, this will be fun. Let’s have our battle! 
I might’ve said it before, but you’re really tough! Wasn’t it hard for you to raise your Pokémon to be so good? I guess that’s a measure of how much you love your Pokémon. In recognition of that, I proudly grant you this! 
[VAR(259, 0)] received the Forest Badge from Gardenia!
With the Forest Badge, your Pokémon can use the hidden move Cut outside of battle. Now that you have two Gym Badges, all Pokémon you received in trades will obey you up to Lv. 30. I’ve also got something else. It’s a gift from me! 
That [VAR(264, 0)] contains the move [VAR(262, 1)]. It’s one of my favorite moves. The heavier the foe, the more damage this move will cause.
Yup! If there’s one thing I can tell about you, it’s this! You and your Pokémon are gonna get even tougher, and I mean seriously!
How did you know where to find me? Let’s have our battle! 
OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past the two boulders...I think.
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some serious special attacks... I won’t let you win...easily! 
Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer... In the middle of three trees. That’s it for my hint. Good luck.
Even when you try to conceal it, you can’t hide the aroma of flowers. 
Your next opponent is beside four flowers.
Giggle! You found me! Of course I’ll battle you! 
Giggle! There’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on, don’t be afraid!

A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share will be given some of the Exp. Points from battle. It will get Exp. Points even if it didn’t actually battle. I would say an Exp. Share is quite useful for raising weak Pokémon. Also, a Pokémon you get in a trade may disobey you if it is too high in level. Don’t worry, though. It will obey if you have enough Gym Badges.

I am! I am the first to have gone underground and dug some tunnels. You can call me the Underground Man. Everyone else does. I’ll make a gift of this to you. You hold up your end of the deal and put it to good use! 
My gift to you, the Explorer Kit, will instantly take you underground! You need only to use it, and you will be down in the tunnels! The Underground is a different world where you can do this, that, and the other thing, too! Let me mentor you into becoming a full-fledged spelunker! Will you take on that challenge?
Let me mentor you as you become a full-fledged spelunker! Will you take on that challenge?
I had hoped to teach a youngster like you about the many charms of the underground tunnels... But I can’t force you to accept my proposal if you’re not inclined. Sigh... I get so lonely sometimes...
Hm! Well said, my young friend! I will teach you by assigning missions. First, go underground! Going underground is quite easy. Simply use your Explorer Kit. If you accomplish that, I will give you your next test.
You’ve not gone underground yet? To get down to the underground tunnels, you need only to use your Explorer Kit. But you need to be outside. It can’t be used indoors or in a cave. Now, off you go!
Hm! I see that you’ve gone down to the underground tunnels! Well done! Take these as rewards! 
Those are called Traps. They’re triggered when stepped on. The Underground is a place where you can go with your friends. You might try setting those Traps when you’re down there with others. Now, what should I assign you next...
How was it in the underground tunnels? Big and empty, I would think. But that’s only because you are a novice spelunker! There are many hidden things down there that are not visible to the eye. For my next test, I want you to dig up some Treasure or Spheres for me. While underground, check the Radar for yellow spots. Go to such a location and search for Treasure using the Touch Screen.
You’ve not located any Treasure  or Spheres yet? Listen. Check the Radar and go to any yellow spot that’s shown. Next, use the Touch Screen to identify places to dig. Try to get right on top of a yellow spot on the Radar, OK? Once you are right in front of it, press the A Button! Now, off you go on your search!
Ah! You dug up what I was looking for! Good job on finding it! Well done, indeed! Take these as your reward! 
Dig in the walls of the underground tunnels to unearth hidden stuff. Fossils and Stones can be dug up and brought out from down under. Spheres, which are gems, cannot be brought out, but they can be exchanged for goods down there. Now, what should I assign you next...?
My tests aren’t over yet! Next, let’s use some Spheres! The Spheres one can find underground are very peculiar. When buried in the ground, they grow daily, a little bit at a time. I want you to go bury these strange Spheres in the underground tunnels. That is my latest test!
You’ve not buried the Spheres yet? You’re afraid of losing them? Have no fear! Spheres are easily buried and just as easily dug up. Don’t be afraid. Go bury those Spheres like I’ve said. Just don’t forget where you’ve buried them--the Underground is huge!
Good, good! You’ve buried your Spheres! The next time you go underground, they should have grown bigger! Just don’t forget where you’ve buried your Spheres! Anyway, well done! This is your reward! 
You may have seen them already, but there are Sphere collectors. They wander about in the underground tunnels seeking Spheres. They’ll happily trade you items for big Spheres. Now, what shall I assign you next...?
Have you grown weary of repeatedly going back to the Underground? Well, it’s not over yet! Next up is your Secret Base! That’s right, I will teach you how to make your own Secret Base! All you need is the Digger Drill I gave you earlier. Simply go underground and use the Digger Drill wherever you like. That will instantly make you your very own Secret Base! So, your next assignment is: go make your own Secret Base!
Hm? You don’t know how to use the Digger Drill? OK, I’ll admit this test may have been a little tricky for you. All you need to do is find the Digger Drill among your Traps. Then, face a wall and use the Digger Drill. That’s all it takes. Do that and you’ll have your Secret Base before you can say... [VAR(65281, 200)]Boo![VAR(65281, 100)] No, seriously though!
Ah, you’ve made your Secret Base! Excellent! I thought I might have been asking too much of you, but you did it! Well done! Take these as your reward! 
Incidentally, a Digger Drill can be used only once. If you wish to move your Secret Base, you will need to obtain another Digger Drill. You can trade a Sphere for one underground. What should I make you do next...
Hm! You’ve stuck it out to the end! This is my final test. You’ve made yourself a Secret Base, but it’s totally empty, is it not? Not to worry! You can decorate your own Secret Base as you see fit! So! For my final test, I want you to decorate your Secret Base. Use furniture and interior goods to give your Secret Base character!
Ah, have I finally managed to stump you? Perhaps you’ve left your Secret Base’s door open? You see, the underground tunnels are visited by many Trainers. It wouldn’t do to have someone barge in on you while you’re working on your Secret Base. Don’t forget to close the door while you’re redecorating!
Ah! You’ve even managed to decorate your Secret Base! I knew I recognized a spelunker in you! Don’t forget to close the door when you’re decorating! We don’t want any visitors getting hurt by walking in on you! Also, if you want to place goods you’ve received, store them in the PC first. Anyways, well done! This is your reward! 
There are ways of collecting more decoration goods. You can grow Spheres you’ve found and trade them for goods. It’s also possible to obtain goods from friends.
I’ve taught you all I know, but if you insist, there is one more thing I should tell you. The Secret Base you’ve made has Big Boulders that get in the way, yes? There is actually a way of moving those boulders aside... However, the task may be dangerous for you now. I suppose I could tell you how when you get better as a spelunker... 
...Hm! However, you are someone I’d recognized as a born spelunker... Fine! I will tell you, but only because you’re exceptional! You know that you may go underground with your friends, correct? That means your friends are certain to have Secret Bases of their own. Now, this is what you must do: First, find a friend’s Secret Base. Next, go to the PC and steal your friend’s Flag. Then, run back to your Secret Base and take the Flag to your PC! If you can do that, I will permit you to move boulders.
Ah! My spelunker! Are you spelunking with your friends? It’s a hundred times more fun to play with friends underground! If you manage to steal a Flag from a friend’s Secret Base, you be sure to come show me!
Wait! Don’t tell me! You’ve captured a Flag? Excellent! You should already be capable of moving Big Boulders inside your Secret Base! You can shunt aside a boulder by storing it like furniture. Anyways, well done! This is your reward! 
There really is nothing else that I can teach you. If you wish to put away more Big Boulders or put out more goods, keep capturing more Flags. Become the spelunking master for me!
So, my spelunker, are you going underground with your friends? The underground tunnels are vast. They can be a place where you meet many others like you.
Ah, you’ve captured three Flags! Well done! Take this as your reward! 
Ah, you’ve captured ten Flags! Well done! Take this as your reward! 
Oh! Oh! My goodness! You’ve captured fifty Flags! Fantastic! Take this as your reward! 
You have been outstanding! There really is nothing left to teach you. From now on, you are the spelunking master!
Oh? Your underground PC appears to be full. Discard a decorative item or two, then come see me again.
Hm! This belongs to you! 
The underground tunnels go everywhere! Grab your friends and let’s play together using DS Wireless Communications!
Let’s dig up some Treasure! I’m from Oreburgh. I work at the mining museum there. I got advice from the Underground Man on digging up Treasure and Spheres. Before I get digging, let me share his advice with you. While you’re digging, you may uncover dark rocks. They are very hard! If you keep hitting them, the wall will collapse. Don’t forget that, and you’ll be digging up Treasure in no time!
Oh, you’d like more advice on digging up Treasure and Spheres? Well, your Explorer Kit contains a sledgehammer and a pickax. Choose either of these tools and touch the lower screen to dig. You get to keep the stuff you fully uncover before the wall collapses. Don’t forget, the dark rocks are impossible to break. If you hit them too often, the wall will collapse. Don’t forget that, and you’ll be digging up Treasure in no time!
New and on sale! Underground Radar! The upper radar screen indicates possible Treasure locations. The lower Touch Radar indicates precise locations!
There is a book titled “Shortcut to the Underground.” 
Which page would you like to read?
Flags: A Flag can be found in every Secret Base. Capture a friend’s Flag and take it to your own Secret Base to make improvements to it! Find your friends’ Secret Bases and capture their Flags! 
Spheres: In the underground tunnels, you can dig up pretty stones that are called Spheres. There are people underground that treat Spheres like money. Trade them your Spheres in exchange for decoration goods and other items. These Spheres also have the strange property of growing if they are buried in the ground. 
Traps: There are Traps that can be put down in the underground tunnels. There are many kinds of Traps for unwary Trainers under the ground. Some Traps need to be blown away. Some need to be removed by touch. 
Goods: These are furniture and decorative items for Secret Bases. Collect goods by exchanging Spheres for them, or by getting gifts from friends! 
Treasure: These are rare items that appear while digging underground. They can be taken out of the Underground if placed in your Bag while in the tunnels. Dig around all over and find Treasure!

Oh, thank goodness that you happened to be there! If it weren’t for you, who knows how far away my BUNEARY could have run... 
Baby BUNEARY, back into the Poké Ball you go! 
I’m Keira! I’m a Pokémon Contest Judge. Please drop by the Contest Hall so I can thank you properly! 
Oh, I’m so sorry! Please excuse me. Are you entering a Contest? Tehehe... Enjoy yourself, please! Incidentally, Fantina, the Hearthome Gym Leader, also happens to be a Contest expert. And you may ask yourself, how do I know this? Well, I am Fantina! You may challenge me, but not yet! You must become much stronger. Then, you may challenge me! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: Ta-daah! Kept me waiting again, [VAR(259, 1)]! Let’s see how much tougher you and I have gotten, right here and now! Hey, you’re a Trainer now. You’re expected to be ready for a battle. No whining! No waiting! Let’s get the show started! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: Waaaagh! You KO’d my team again?! This messes up my dream of becoming the greatest Trainer ever... No! I just need to get tougher and keep winning. One day... That’s it! I’m going to challenge the Veilstone Gym next! See you around, [VAR(259, 1)]! You’ll be blown away by how much tougher I’ll be next time we meet! 
You’re kidding! They found an Egg at the Day Care in Solaceon Town?
I hear they found Eggs in the Johto region, too.
Cynthia: I’m so glad to see you! You’re not very easy to track down. My grandma told me about what took place in Celestic Town. Thanks for what you did in the ruins! 
But that Team Galactic... I thought they were just an eccentric bunch of freaks... You know, talking about how they’re going to make a new universe and all. And that weird way they dress, too. I thought they were harmless. It appears as if they’re a lot more trouble than I thought... I mean, stealing and hoarding Pokémon... That’s just plain wrong. 
By the way, did you find the ruins interesting at all? If you did, you may want to visit the library in Canalave City. They have some ancient books that you might find interesting. It may also be of help to the completion of your Pokédex. I think you ought to go there. OK, bye-bye for now! 
You’re a Trainer, are you? You’ve got two choices of challenges, either the Gym or a Contest, right?
I was given the HM Strength at the Lost Tower. The Lost Tower is on Route 209 on the way to Solaceon Town.
                                                     
There are just so many Accessories to dress up Pokémon with. I can’t decide what I should use.
I get to see Pokémon all day long, but there sure are many kinds. How many are there now?
I used a Water Stone on my Pokémon, and it evolved!
I’m visiting here all the way from the Hoenn region. I had been hoping to find the Contest Hall, but being new, I lost my way. Fortunately, the local people very kindly led me to my destination. I was impressed by their kindness and generosity to a complete stranger. Now, may I offer you the courtesy of showing you to the Contest Hall?
Ah. Please follow me. 
This is the Contest Hall. Please, do go inside.
It makes me happy knowing I’ve helped another person.
Oh, I do apologize. I should mind my own business.
When I take my baby out in his stroller, I see the town in a different way. I notice things like stairs and bumps in the sidewalk.
Apapapu!
I went for a stroll in Amity Square with my PACHIRISU today. We came across a Pokémon feather while we walked. Do you think it’d make my PACHIRISU look any cuter?
PACHIRISU: Kyukyuuh!
Hi, hi. Do you want a Pokémon Egg? They found this at the Day Care in Solaceon Town... Want to take it?
Here you go!
This is what I heard about Eggs. If you take that Egg and travel with energetic Pokémon, it’ll hatch. I remember someone announced that... Professor Elm of Johto maybe?
Hold up. You don’t seem to have enough room for the Egg.
All right, then. I’ll just keep waiting for someone to take care of this Egg. Oh? Wait a minute. If I wait around, will the Egg hatch for me?
They call me Mr. Goods. No one knows my real name. No, not even I do... I dedicate myself to seeking rarities. It’s what I live for. 
Hm! Hmhmhmhm?! 
                   
I was going to give you something, but I just gave a rare thing away. I’ll find something else for you, so just talk to me some other time.
            
                      
Oh? Your underground PC appears to be full. I’ll hold your gift until you make room for it. Tell me when, OK?
                                             
I’ll find something rare for you, so talk to me some other time.

Hey, there! How’s it going, Trainer? You being here tells me you’re going to challenge the Gym Leader. Well... I hate to break it to you, but that’s impossible. You’re questioning why, and the answer is: she’s not here. Come back another time, OK? I’ll be right here waiting.
So, where’s the Gym Leader, you ask. I can’t precisely say, but I have a hunch that she’ll return one day... But only after you visit other places, I think. Hey, I’m sorry I’m not useful to you. My advice giving needs work...
Hey, there! How’s it going, Champ-to-be? The Gym Leader here is a user of Ghost-type Pokémon. Beware, Normal-type moves have no effect at all on ghosts! It’s as if they weren’t there! But you’ll have to see for yourself. Go get ’em, challenger! I believe in you!

I say to myself, enfin, I will excel. That is why I dress this way. C’est une performance! Also, I study Pokémon very much. I have come to be Gym Leader. And, uh, so it shall be that you challenge me. But I shall win. That is what a Gym Leader does, non? 
I am dumbfounded! So very, very strong! You, your Pokémon, so strong! Your power is admirable! I shall honor it with this Gym Badge!

That Badge will let you use the hidden move Surf outside of battle. Also, you can make use of this Technical Machine. That is what I think.

If you feed your Pokémon Poffins routinely, you’ll be able to enter Contests whenever you like.
They’re saying that Gym Leader Fantina’s not around. Heh! She must’ve heard I’m around and chickened out!

Hello, hello! How, I say, do you do? I am the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman! Indeed, yes I am! When you wish to treat your Pokémon to a treat, what, I say, do you do? If I may say so, and I will, I feed Poffins to my Pokémon! And why, I say, would I do that? Because the giving of Poffins is a way of expressing your love! For example! If I were to give a Sweet Poffin, the Pokémon eating it would become more cute! For example! A Spicy Poffin will add to the coolness of a Pokémon! In such ways I say that Poffins have nothing but goodness for Pokémon! Therefore! I declare this Poffin Case to be a gift from me to you! 
I urge you to fill it with Poffins and be generous in dispensing them to your Pokémon!
Nationwide, there are other fan clubs, but we are number one! And why are we number one? Because I brag more than anyone! But now I can’t brag as much... People started complaining, so I’ve had to curtail my bragging...

Hi! Let’s get cooking! Here’s my advice on cooking tasty Poffins for your Pokémon crew! In the beginning, while it’s still a batter, swirl it gently and avoid spillage. When it starts to harden, churn it fast in big circles! At the end, make a wish for it to turn scrumptious and whirl it!
Have you got some Berries? To make delicious Poffins, the key ingredient is a rare Berry. And, the more cooks you have, the more delicious the Poffin!
Eating good food makes people and Pokémon more energetic and happy. In that sense, we’re exactly alike.

For the Visual judging, you want to dress up your Pokémon nicely with Accessories matched to the theme. That means you’ll be at an advantage if you have lots of Accessories.
For the Dance competition, your Pokémon needs to perfectly mimic the dance steps of the lead dancer.
For the performance aspect of Contests, Pokémon need the right kinds of moves. But what’s even more important is your choice of the Judge. If everyone performs for the same Judge, your Pokémon leaves less of an impression on that Judge.
At the Cool Contest you gotta pull off a cool move! Gets the Judges all excited! If the Judge’s excitement peaks, you score massive bonus points! So hot!

And there do I see my father. My son. My life. And there do I see nature. Pokémon. The world.
The art of crafting things fatigues one’s spirit. When the spirit is healed, the desire to make something returns. It is such a wondrous cycle.
When people and Pokémon join hands, everyone’s happy. It makes everyone come together. It could even make the world one!
That people are lonely is only natural. It gives me compassion for others. It’s what makes me look forward to a better tomorrow. But there are still moments of fondness for the past. Though, time can heal some sadness...
There are still words that not everyone can describe... The words are “love” and “joy.”
Pokémon... People... It’s only natural that we are all so very different. Make sure that you never judge a Pokémon on if it’s weak or strong. You must always look for the good inside of them. That’s what counts!

Grr... The package hasn’t arrived from the Veilstone warehouse yet... I have to wait here until then? I’m going batty from this wait... Oh, man, I wish I could do something that involved lots of explosives! Yup, this is going to be a smashing job for Team Galactic...
Grr... This is so annoying... What is it, you? Oh, some kid with only three Gym Badges. Little buggers like you should know to stay out of Team Galactic’s way! ...Now, this package from Veilstone... Where should I set it off...? Yup, this is going to be a smashing job for Team Galactic...
Hahah! The package finally came from the Veilstone warehouse! So, now it’s my job to deliver this to the lake! This is an important mission. No failure allowed! No making boo-boos like wandering off into the Great Marsh! 
You were eavesdropping! I was just talking loudly to myself! If I wasn’t in a hurry, I’d pulverize you with my Pokémon! But I have to get on my way to the lake ASAP! So, you’re lucky! I’m out! Oh, and listen up, you! Don’t you dare follow me! 
Gweh! Persistent pest! If our plan works, our boss’s dream comes closer to fruition! Our boss’s ideal world is going to be created! So, I’m not going to waste my time on a nobody like you! I’m telling you now, don’t you come chasing after me! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: Whoops! Hehehe! I’m not always going to plow into you every time we meet! So how’s it going, [VAR(259, 1)]? Buffing up your Pokémon, eh? I’ll test you and your Pokémon out to see how buff and tough you are! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: Heh, yeah, maybe you did get a bit tougher since last time. That even shocked me a bit, so yeah, I got beat ’cause I was careless. So, hey, what was that Team Galactic guy all freaking out about? I don’t know what he’s up to, but you should chase him down! If you’re not a Pokémon, and you run like that... You’re a bad guy. All right, [VAR(259, 1)]! Next time, I’m not holding back! 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
Here where I am standing, I’m smack-dab in the middle of town.
I study rare Pokémon that appear only in the Great Marsh.
Some Trainers deliberately prevent their Pokémon from evolving. They wait until the Pokémon levels up and learns certain moves.
I’m visiting the area because I wanted to see the Great Marsh. I’m staying at the lakeside hotel.
Pastoria’s Gym Leader is like... Breathtaking... In a weird way. It’s hard to explain. You’ll know what I mean, though.
Wasn’t the Pastoria Gym Leader kind of breathtaking in a weird way? But don’t judge him by the way he looks and acts. I hear he uses the prize money to help people and Pokémon in trouble.
The Great Marsh keeps the weather cool in the summertime. This is a good town for Water-type Pokémon.
CLEFAIRY: Fiiih?!
You’re just like a totally impatient boy I met earlier. Just like you, he was very close with his Pokémon. Hey, thanks for making me smile! This might put a smile on your face. Try dressing up a Pokémon with this [VAR(287, 0)]. 
Someone gave me a Berry, so I planted it and grew some more. Then, I took the Berries and cooked them into Poffins. All the work is worth it when I see how happy they make my Pokémon!
Someone in the Great Marsh offered me a Hidden Machine, but I declined. I don’t need it ’cause the Gym Leader will do Defog for us if we ever need it in this city.

You need that Fen Badge to use the hidden move Defog outside of battle. This is a special reward from me in recognition of your team’s power. 
That [VAR(264, 0)] contains the move [VAR(262, 1)]. It inflicts double the damage on targets with less than half their HP left. Use it to end battles decisively!
The styles of battling and winning are as widely varied as Trainers are. Do you want to know how I battle? I battle so I can say I had fun at the end, whether I win or lose!
The Gym Leader Wake... Uh, I mean Crasher Wake, is a master of Water-type Pokémon. I’d say you’ve got guts if you try to face down Water types with Fire- or Ground-type Pokémon! But that part I’ll leave up to you! Go and have some good battles!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve beaten the Gym Leader! So, how was it? Did you enjoy your battle against Wake... I mean Crasher Wake? Sure, winning is important, but don’t forget to have fun, too! I think Wake... I mean Crasher Wake, showed you what I mean by fun.

There are shuttle trains in the marsh called Quick Trams. You should take those if you’re going to a deeper area in the marsh.

Oh! That’s it! That’s an honest-to- goodness Heart Scale! Let me guess, you want me to teach one of your Pokémon a move? 
If any of your Pokémon needs to learn a move, come back with a Heart Scale.

Thank you very much! Here are your Coins!
Um... You don’t appear to have enough money...
Oh? Your Coin Case is full.
Oh... You don’t need Coins, then? Please come again!
Ten straight bonus rounds on the slots! That’s amazing! I would say you had an explosion of good luck! So, please take this Technical Machine as a memento!

Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look at it! It’s driving me bananas! Oh, if only you had a Coin Case! Then you’d know what fun this is!
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look! Yeahah! It’s a carnival! Let me share some of my joy with you! [VAR(259, 0)] received 50 Coins from the man. [VAR(259, 0)] put the Coins away in the Coin Case.
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! It’s adorable! Just seeing it gets my pulse racing! Oh, let me impart a piece of advice to you! If the moon turns red, you don’t want to get a replay because it makes CLEFAIRY tired!
I want Coins, of course, but setting records is hot, too!
When a Poké Ball appears, it’s a chance to line up slot marks. Replays and PIKACHU line up even if you don’t make an effort. But you need to aim for better marks, like Poké Balls and Moon Stones.
A friend in my group scored a ton of Coins here. I’m going to challenge him!
Sigh... Nothing’s going my way today... Are you a Trainer? Did you battle the Gym Leader? She happens to be my daughter. She’s some kind of tough!
Shoot for 10! Line up those bonus rounds! If you accomplish the feat of completing 10 uninterrupted bonus rounds, please go to the counter. You will be presented with a fabulous prize! The current record sits at [VAR(308, 0)] straight bonus rounds!

Yo! Fellow Trainer! Your Pokémon are secure inside their Poké Balls, but there’s no masking that aura of serious toughness! Oops, sorry, I should introduce myself. The name’s Flint! I’m one of the Pokémon League’s Elite Four! 
I just had this idea. Maybe you can pull it off. It’s about this town’s Gym Leader. He’s really lost his enthusiasm lately because there’ve been so few good challengers worth his time. He’s been so bored, he spends all his time renovating the Gym. And then the blackout happened... That sure didn’t help lift his mood. You know where I’m going with this, don’t you? I need you to give him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his passion for battling. I’m counting on you, hotshot! 
Flint: Yo! Hiya! He hasn’t come back yet. When he does, you know what you’ve gotta do. Give him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his passion for battling! I’m counting on you, hotshot!
Flint: Yo! Hiya! He’s finally come back! He seemed to be feeling upbeat, too. I have a hunch that he recognized your toughness right away. I bet he’s getting excited over the thought of battling you. Remember what you have to do, hotshot. Give him a battle that’s so hot, it will reignite his passion for battling! All right, hotshot! I’ll be waiting at the Pokémon League! 
...Er...um... M-my name is Jasmine, and I’m a Gym Leader. Oh, I’m sorry, not the Gym Leader of this town... I’m a Gym Leader in the Johto region... ...Er...um... It would be nice if you knew about the Johto region... 
Oh, if you don’t have the Gym Badge, you’ll be forced to turn back.
Oh, that’s this town’s Gym Badge. You must be very good. ...Er...um... P-please take this, too. 
...That Hidden Machine... It contains Waterfall. If you use it, you can get to the Pokémon League. ...Um... I... I don’t know how I should say this, but good luck.
Jasmine: ...This city makes me feel at home somehow. It’s next to the sea, and there’s a lighthouse... 
Jasmine: ...I came from very far away because I wanted to get stronger. On the way, I met all sorts of  people with their Pokémon... They all looked like they were having fun. I felt happy seeing it.
                                      
That giant rock... Isn’t it really a Pokémon?
                                           
The Gym Leader uses too much electricity! He needs to think about the city’s power needs, too!
The city uses a lot of electricity, especially the lighthouse and the Gym. They finally decided to turn all the roads inside the city into giant solar panels. Sunyshore is the Sunshine City, so the system works perfectly.

Listen carefully...one last time! The Gym Leader here is a master of Electric-type Pokémon! That’s all I have to say. The rest is up to you!
Oh! [VAR(259, 0)]! Did you beat the Gym Leader? Well, of course you did! But, you know what? You haven’t made it in my mind yet! Do you know why? Because you and your Pokémon are capable of achieving so much more! But, I am proud of you! Eight Sinnoh Badges! Way to go, kiddo!

...All right, challenger. It’s not often, but some Trainers manage to come and challenge me. But they’ve all been boring battles. I didn’t break a sweat beating them. ...Sigh... I’m Volkner, the Gym Leader. They say I’m the top Gym Leader in Sinnoh, but... Anyway, I guess we’d better get this done. I hope you’re the Trainer who’ll make me remember how fun it is to battle! 
...Hehehe. Hahahah! ...That was the most fun I’ve had in a battle since...I don’t know when! It’s also made me excited to know you and your team will keep battling to greater heights! This is your eighth Gym Badge. You’ve earned this! 
[VAR(259, 0)] received the Beacon Badge from Volkner.
That Beacon Badge lets you use the hidden move Waterfall even when you’re not in a battle. Waterfall happens to be key if you’re going to the Pokémon League. Also, because you’ve collected all eight Badges, any Pokémon at any level will now obey you without fail. I want you to take this, too. 
What’s inside that [VAR(264, 0)] is the move [VAR(262, 1)]. It may raise Special Attack if it lands. It’s pretty hot.

By any chance, do you have a Pokémon called MEDICHAM? If you do, would you like to trade your MEDICHAM for my HAUNTER?
Haha! Did my HAUNTER turn into something else? Just kidding! I made it hold something that prevents it from evolving. Please treat my HAUNTER nicely! I’ll be good to your MEDICHAM, too!
What I asked for was a MEDICHAM...?
It’s OK if you don’t want to. But if you change your mind, let’s trade Pokémon.
Thanks to Pokémon, we got to be friends, didn’t we?

Hello, hello. Would you like to hear a trendy saying?
Very well... The trendy thing to say for you would be... [VAR(284, 0)]! That’s a trendy sort of thing to say.
Oh, come on now. With an attitude like that, you’ll fall behind the times!
I hope you’ll use trendy sayings in a trendy way.

Victory Road... It lives up to that lofty name...
...It broke me once, but that only added to my resolve!

[VAR(259, 0)]: Hold it! Don’t go off without me! You’re challenging the Pokémon League, aren’t you? That’s why I’m here, too. Let’s see who’s more worthy of making the challenge with a battle! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: I guess I’m not ready for the Pokémon League if I’m losing to you! Darn it! You watch, though! I’ll get tougher and win my way through the Pokémon League! Because I’m going to become the Champion, the toughest Trainer! [VAR(259, 1)]! You’d better not lose to anyone before me! 
Let me confirm that you are qualified to challenge the Pokémon League. So! Let us examine the Gym Badges you gathered from Sinnoh. Oreburgh City’s Coal Badge! Eterna City’s Forest Badge! Veilstone City’s Cobble Badge! Pastoria City’s Fen Badge! Hearthome City’s Relic Badge! Canalave City’s Mine Badge! Snowpoint City’s Icicle Badge! And... Sunyshore City’s Beacon Badge! 
Very well! Trainer, you’ve indeed collected all the Gym Badges of Sinnoh! Demonstrate the power that brought you here and go for glory!
You will be facing the Elite Four of the Pokémon League. If you can’t beat all four of them in a row, you have to start from the first one again.
Your Pokémon are so calm even though they’re going up against the Elite Four. I like how they’re so loose and relaxed.

Hello! Welcome to the Pokémon League! I’m Aaron of the Elite Four. It’s good to meet you. Oh, I should explain, I’m a huge fan of bug Pokémon. Bug Pokémon are nasty-mean, and yet they’re beautiful, too... Would you like to know why I take on challengers here, in this room? It’s because I want to become perfect, just like my bug Pokémon! OK! Let me take you on! 
I lost with the most beautiful and toughest of the bug Pokémon... We lost because I wasn’t good enough... That’s it! Back to training camp! Let’s hear it for me! No... That was wrong... Anyway... Go on to the next room! Three Trainers are waiting for you. They’re all tougher than me.
Go on, go to the next room. I’m going to become a top-level Trainer who can’t be outclassed with my beautiful and tough bug Pokémon!

===============================

===============================
Well, well. You’re quite the adorable Trainer, but you’ve also got a spine. Ahaha! I’m Bertha. I have a preference for Ground-type Pokémon. Well, would you show this old lady how much you’ve learned? 
You’re quite something, youngster. I like how you and your Pokémon earned the win by working as one. That’s what makes you so strong. Ahahaha! I think that you can go as far as you want.
The Trainer in the next room is a much more formidable opponent. You really must have your wits about you. However, I think you can go as far as you desire. Ahahaha!

===============================

===============================
Yo, Trainer! You had me counting the days on my fingers waiting for you to come. I heard from Volkner what you  did in Sunyshore. You managed to light a fire in that guy’s heart again. How could you not expect me to look forward to seeing you in battle? 
You’re facing a Fire-type Pokémon user with me. Let Flint see how hot your spirit burns! 
... ... ... ... ... ... ...Whew... ...Burnt right down to cinders...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...Keep going...
I was waiting for you, challenger! Flint, the master of the Fire type, is up next! Battles are clashes of the burning spirit of Pokémon. Battles aren’t about appearances, or what’s weak or strong. It all comes down to whether the combatants can burn hot and bright or not. 
... ... ...Whew... ...Burnt right down to cinders...
... ... ...Keep going... I know your spirit burns hot and bright. Your whole team does.

Ah, you timed your arrival well. I’ve just finished reading a book, you see. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lucian. I am a user of the Psychic type. I must say, you’ve already proven yourself to be outstanding by coming this far. They say I am the toughest of the Elite Four. I’m afraid I will have to go all out against you to live up to that reputation. 
Congratulations. You’ve now beaten the Elite Four. However, that doesn’t mean you’re done with the Pokémon League. There remains the Champion. I should warn you--the Champion is far stronger than the Elite Four. Now, go on. Step through the doorway to your final battle.
I’ll be reading books until the next challenger arrives. That will calm my nerves, so that I may deal with all situations without panicking.

Cynthia: Have you been keeping well? Thank you for Mt. Coronet. I’m truly grateful. Together, you and your Pokémon overcame all the challenges you faced, however difficult. It means that you’ve triumphed over any personal weaknesses, too. The power you learned... I can feel it emanating from you. But that’s enough talk. Let’s get on with why you’re here. As the Pokémon League Champion, I accept your challenge! 
Cynthia: That was excellent. Truly, an outstanding battle. You gave the support your Pokémon needed to maximize their power. And you guided them with certainty to secure victory. You have both passion and calculating coolness. Together, you and your Pokémon  can overcome any challenge that may come your way. Those are the impressions I got from our battle. I’m glad I got to take part in the crowning of Sinnoh’s new Champion! 
Come with me. We’ll take the lift.

It means that you’ve triumphed over any personal weaknesses, too. The power you learned... I can feel it from you. That’s enough talking. Let’s get on with why you’re here. I, Cynthia, accept your challenge as the Pokémon League Champion! There won’t be any letup from me!

[VAR(259, 0)]: Oh, hey, [VAR(259, 1)]! What took you so long? I’m fining you $100 million! Listen up. I’m going to become the greatest Trainer ever. That’s why I’m here--to toughen up myself and my Pokémon! 
Hehehe! Sorry! I couldn’t help overhearing that. But the greatest Trainer ever?! That’s going to be really tough. Because you’re talking about me! To prove that, I’m going to the volcano right now. You look puzzled. You really don’t know anything, do you? All right, I’ll tell you. This is the Battle Zone, OK? At the far end, there’s a volcano. And deep inside the volcano, there’s supposed to be a treasure. 
[VAR(259, 0)]: So? What’s the big deal? If I find that treasure first, that’ll make me the greatest Trainer ever? That’s what I’ll do, [VAR(259, 1)]! And you too, stranger! I’m gonna get the treasure first! But before that, I’m going to the Battle Tower! See ya! 
That guy... He can’t stay still, can he? 
Anyways, howdy, I’m Buck. Sheesh, that punk can’t beat me. So, do you know that zippity-doodah of a Trainer? You should chase after that guy and tell him not to underestimate the volcano. Oh, but you know what? You’d better shape up at the Battle Tower first, too. I don’t like your chances of getting to the volcano, otherwise. Be seeing you! 
Howdy, Trainer! You have a Pokédex, do you? I bet the person who gave you that is waiting for you to fill that Pokédex completely.
Howdy, Trainer! You have a Pokédex, do you? Here’s my advice: go out and challenge other Trainers! They’ll often have different Pokémon, so your Pokédex should fill up fast!
The way the Battle Tower looms... It really is a wall that stands before every Trainer.
I’ve battled many Trainers over the years. I’ve gained some confidence in my skill levels, too. But the world is still a huge place. It’s not easy to win in life!
Because of the volcano, the land around here is craggy. The rough terrain and all the ups and downs make it hard to hike.
The Pokémon League’s Elite Four come here sometimes!
Your Pokémon are from Sinnoh, aren’t they? They’re not what we’re used to seeing around here.
There’s no end to becoming tough! I just made that up, but it sounds kind of cool, huh?
What’s up? Do you want to sail to Snowpoint City?
Aye, right! It’s anchors aweigh, then! 
Oh, right. You’d rather just fly everywhere in some big hurry.
Whenever I go to a new place, I get excited over what I might discover. But places I’ve visited before... Even those places thrill me with new discoveries!
Hmm! A Super Rod is really good! Wouldn’t you agree?
Hmm! We’re of identical minds! Hmm! Take this [VAR(264, 0)]! 
Wherever there’s water, try your luck at fishing.
Don’t you like to fish?
What’s that? Any advice for fishing? Well, I’ll tell you. It’s all about the rod and technique!

[VAR(259, 0)]: ...! It’s OK, though. [VAR(259, 1)], the tougher you get, the tougher we can get, too. There’s no end to Pokémon. That’s what I’m saying, [VAR(259, 1)].

What items should Pokémon hold? It’s an important question. Here’s something else to think about.

Welcome to the Battle Park! It’s your first time, isn’t it? Please step this way. 
Since this is your first visit, you need to be given a Point Card. Point Cards are used only in the Battle Park. Here you go. 
If you need information on the Point Card, please ask the receptionist next to me. I’m the one to ask if you need any information on the facilities here in the Battle Park. For information on the battle rules used at the Battle Park, please ask the receptionist across from me. 
Welcome to the Battle Park! If you need any information on the facilities, I’m the one to ask. 
What would you like me to explain?
The Battle Park is a place where Trainers may enjoy battles. There are two facilities in the Battle Park: the Exchange Service Corner and the Battle Tower. 
The Exchange Service Corner is the building that looks like a castle. There, you may exchange the BP (Battle Points) you’ve earned for items. Fabulous prizes are offered, so please do visit the Exchange Service Corner when you save up BP. 
The Battle Tower is the building at the back of the Battle Park. The tower has four sets of Battle Rooms for different kinds of battles. The Single Battle Rooms are for conducting one-on-one battles. The Double Battle Rooms are for two-on-two battles. The Multi Battle Rooms are for tag team battles with a partner. The Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are for battling other Trainers from around the world. 
Welcome to the Battle Park! I can explain how the Point Card and the BP (Battle Points) work. 
What would you like me to explain?
Every Trainer visiting the Battle Park is provided with a Point Card that confirms their challenger status. The Point Card stores BP (Battle Points) that you earn from battling in the Battle Tower. 
BP, short for Battle Points, are used only in the Battle Park. You will earn BP by hitting certain performance targets battling at the Battle Tower. The BP can be traded for prizes at the Exchange Service Corner. 
Welcome to the Battle Park! I can give you a rundown of the battle rules that are used at the Battle Tower. 
What would you like me to explain?
In the Battle Tower, you may enter Pokémon in battles that are capped at Lv. 50. Pokémon up to Lv. 50 may be entered with a few exceptions. Pokémon above Lv. 50 may also be entered, but their level will be cut to Lv. 50 in the Battle Tower. The reduced level will be restored when you leave the Battle Tower. Please keep in mind that your opponents will not use Pokémon below Lv. 50. 
Excluding Eggs and certain exotic Pokémon, virtually every species of Pokémon may enter the Battle Tower. Please be aware that the number of Pokémon you may enter will depend on the course you challenge. You are also permitted to take only one of each kind of Pokémon into the Battle Tower. 
Your Pokémon may not be holding the same kind of item in the Battle Tower. Please be sure the Pokémon entering the Battle Tower are all holding different items. 
Good luck!
Welcome to the Battle Park!

The Battle Zone used to attract only the hardiest of the Trainers. They were considered eccentric for gathering at a place like this. It’s hard to believe how much it’s changed since then. Places like the Fight Area and the Survival Area just seemed to spring up overnight.

Mom: [VAR(259, 0)]! Welcome home. It sounds like you had quite the experience out there. Maybe you should take a quick rest so you can relax. ... ...
Mom: Oh, good! You and your Pokémon are looking great. Oh, yes, I heard from Professor Rowan. He said that a Pokémon’s energy is measured in HP (Hit Points). If your Pokémon lose their HP, you can restore it at any Pokémon Center. If you’re going to travel far away, the smart Trainer stocks up on Potions at the Pokémon Mart. Make me proud, honey! Take care!
Mom: Oh, good! You and your Pokémon are looking great. Oh yes, [VAR(259, 0)], your Pokémon will faint if it runs out of HP. If your Pokémon loses its HP, come home before it faints. It will be healed to full health by taking a rest. Well, honey, make me proud! Take care!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Your Pokémon have been healed to perfect health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center when your Pokémon’s HP goes down. If you’re planning to travel any distance, you should stock up on Potions at a Pokémon Mart. Good luck, Trainer!

Welcome to the Contest Hall. I can help you with registering for a Super Contest. 
Would you like to enter a Pokémon in a Contest?
What would you like to know about?
    
Welcome to the Contest Hall! This is the reception counter for linked Super Contests. You may join a group of friends to enter your Pokémon in the same Super Contest over a link.

EXIT
We look forward to your participation another time!
Would you like to enter a link Contest?
Two to four players may compete over a link. First, choose the Contest you wish to enter. Next, make sure the other people in your group choose the same Contest. Then, the players each choose a Pokémon to enter the Contest, and that’s it for registration! After that, the Contest starts in the usual way. We hope you’ll try it out. 
A Pokémon Super Contest involves four Trainers. Each one enters a Pokémon to compete against the others. Judging is conducted in three categories: Visual, Dance, and Acting. The Pokémon scoring the highest in the three categories is the winner. If this is your first time, it is recommended you try some practice sessions before entering a Contest. The registration counter for practice sessions is at the far right. 
In the Visual Competition, Pokémon are rated on their appearance. Scoring is based on votes cast by the audience. For details, please inquire at the practice counter on the right. 
In the Dance Competition, the Pokémon will get to show off their footwork. Try to put on coordinated dance performances with everyone! For details, please inquire at the practice counter on the right. 
In the Acting Competition, the Pokémon will perform their moves in front of Judges. Try to get your Pokémon to put on performances that stand out from the rest of the pack! For details, please inquire at the practice counter on the right. 
There are five Contests in all: Cool, Beauty, Cute, Smart, and Tough. Be sure to choose the Contest that best suits the Pokémon you want to enter with. 
There are four different ranks to the Pokémon Super Contests. The four ranks are Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master. The Normal Rank is open for entry by any Pokémon. A Pokémon winning a Normal Rank Contest may move up to the Great Rank in the same category. Likewise, win a Great Contest and become eligible for the Ultra Rank. An Ultra Rank winner may move up to the Master Rank in the same way. A Master Rank winner may enter Master Rank Contests as often as the Trainer wishes. 
Which Pokémon would you like to enter? 
Please choose a Pokémon. 
OK! Your Pokémon has been accepted for entry! Your entry number is [VAR(306, 0)]! 
We look forward to your participation another time!

A Contest involves judging in three categories: Visual, Dance, and Acting. Here you may practice each of these categories before you actually enter a real Contest. There’s just one thing. Your Pokémon must know at least two moves. Otherwise, it will not qualify for our Super Contests.

Judging here is based on the visual appeal of Pokémon. Scoring is based on voting by the audience. The more popular the Pokémon, the higher its score! The Pokémon are scored in two categories: Condition Points and Dress-up Points. 
Condition Points are scored on the Pokémon’s condition in one of five categories. The five conditions are: Cool, Beauty, Cute, Smart, and Tough. These conditions can be enhanced by feeding Poffins to your Pokémon. If the audience likes what they see, [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks will appear. Obviously, the more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks there are, the more popular the Pokémon. 
Dress-up Points are awarded for fashionably dressing up your Pokémon with Accessories. Before you begin, you will be given a fashion theme. Your dressed-up Pokémon will be scored on how well it matches the assigned theme. The audience’s approval will appear as pink [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks. Be sure to position the Accessories properly and attach them firmly. They won’t stay on otherwise. There is a time limit of 60 seconds. Get your Pokémon dressed up within that time. 
    
We look forward to your next visit!
OVERALL FLOW
BACKUP DANCER
MAIN DANCER
PANEL
CANCEL
In a Dance Competition, the four contestants take on different parts. One becomes the main dancer, and the remaining three are backup dancers. The main dancer scores points by performing inspired dance steps that the others can’t copy. The backup dancers earn high scores by duplicating the dance steps laid down by the main dancer. 
Your Pokémon will first appear as a backup dancer. Make it dance using the same timing as the main dancer. Use the castanets to show your Pokémon which direction the main dancer turned. 
The main dancer rotates with a backup dancer so everyone gets a turn. When your Pokémon is the main dancer, show it how to dance! 
The melody will be shown playing on the red and blue panels. The panel colors show who should be dancing. The main dancer can dance while the melody is in the blue panels. Backup dancers must dance only during the red panels. The dancers must perform the required number of dance steps during their time slots. 
We look forward to your next visit!
OVERALL FLOW
CONTEST MOVES
JUDGES
VOLTAGE
CANCEL
In the Acting Competition, four Pokémon will perform their moves for our panel of Judges. The more a Pokémon stands out, the higher it scores. Each Pokémon will get the chance to perform four times. 
Every move has one or more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks that indicate the acting score. The more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks obtained, the higher the Pokémon scores. However, Pokémon are not permitted to perform the same move two turns in a row. 
There are three Judges in all. You get to choose which one you want to judge your Pokémon. Try not to have your Pokémon scored by the same Judge as other Pokémon so it can stand out more. If your Pokémon leaves a strong impression, it will be rated highly, earning it more [VAR(65280, 1)]♡[VAR(65280, 0)] marks. 
Voltage shows the excitement level of the Judges. In a Cool Contest, if a Pokémon uses a Cool move, Voltage goes up. However, if a Cute or Smart move is performed, the Voltage goes down. If the Voltage reaches 5 points, the Pokémon earns bonus points. If the Special Judge in the center was chosen, 8 bonus points are awarded when the Voltage peaks. For the other Judges, 5 bonus points are awarded.

OK, let me show you in. Right this way, please. 
Thanks for participating! Your Pokémon was quite popular! It’s ready for a real Contest! Or, would you like to practice again?
Thank you for participating! It’s too bad how things turned out... May I suggest feeding Poffins to your Pokémon to improve its condition? You should also use Accessories matched to the dress-up themes to boost your Pokémon’s appeal. Would you like to practice again?

Thanks for participating! Your Pokémon danced quite well! It’s ready for a real Contest! Or, would you like to practice dancing again?
Thank you for participating! It’s too bad how things turned out... The key is to remember which ways the main dancer turned, then make the same moves at the same time. Would you like to practice dancing again?

Thanks for participating! Your Pokémon attracted a good deal of attention! Remember, there are five kinds of Contests: Cool, Beauty, Cute, Smart, and Tough. You can enter your Pokémon in Contests that best suit them. Try getting your Pokémon to stand out in these Contests! Would you like to practice again?
Thank you for participating! It’s too bad how things turned out... A key point is choosing which Judge you want to check your Pokémon’s performance. If your Pokémon performs for a Judge who hasn’t been chosen by another Pokémon, it will score higher. Pick a Judge who will only look at your Pokémon... Aim for that!

OK, stand back and watch this. Using the hidden move Rock Smash, a boulder blocking your way... 
Fallen boulders need to be smashed so they’re out of the way. If you could get the Badge from the Gym in town, you’d be able to do this too. Of course, you’d have to beat the Gym Leader first. That’d be me!

Don’t you dare go into the Valley Windworks. I got ordered to keep everyone out if they’re not part of Team Galactic. You’re giving me a look that makes me think you’re gonna try to get in. OK, then. You’ll have to battle me for it! 
Isn’t that just great. Getting owned by some kid. But you can’t do a thing if I lock myself in with my Works Key! That’s right, the other Works Key’s not here! My cohorts in the flower patch have the only other one! Hahaha! In that sense, I’m no longer the loser! 
Ker-chunk! 
It’s locked from inside!
It’s locked from inside! Use the Works Key?

What?! No way! You have the key? Locking the door was meaningless! I am the loser in this after all! This is no time for self-pity! I’ve got to alert the Commander! 
My Pokémon can’t battle anymore. They’re gonna take away my Pokémon for messing this one up... Humph! Just you wait! Our Commander will smoosh you!
I’m one of Team Galactic’s three Commanders. We’ve been trying to create a new world that’s better than this one... But people have shown little understanding about what we do. You don’t understand either, do you? It’s a little saddening... So, let’s have a battle to decide what we should do next. If I win, you leave. If you win, we, Team Galactic, will leave! 
Oops! I messed that one up! That’s all right, though. I quite enjoyed our battle. I guess it’s time to say good-bye and leave for the time being! 
Team Galactic... They were saying they had to gather Pokémon and energy no matter what. It was for creating a new universe, or so they claimed. Nothing they said made any sort of sense to me. I can’t tell you how grateful I am for saving me. I can finally see my little daughter again! 
Little girl: Papa! Yuck! Papa, you’re stinky! Go shower now, stinky! 
Papa: Oh, sorry! Ahaha! They had me working nonstop! 
Little girl: Thank you, Trainer! You made those bad people go away! I think the balloon Pokémon will come visiting again!
Papa: Oh, yes, a balloon Pokémon appears in front of the windworks. It’s always a certain day of the week, but I’m not sure which day. Could its appearance have something to do with this windworks using wind-generated energy?
The Valley Windworks uses turbines to capture energy from winds driven from the mountains in this canyon. We produce energy from the power of nature itself. It’s quite wonderful.
If the balloon Pokémon came, the wind would blow it away!

I collect Berries and trade them for Accessories in Floaroma Town. I sometimes worry for days on end about what Accessories I should be putting on my Pokémon.

Hello, my name’s Cheryl. And you are...? OK, so your name is [VAR(259, 0)]. I’m sincerely glad to meet you. [VAR(259, 0)], may I ask a big favor of you? I want to get through this forest, but I’m afraid of doing it alone. I’ve heard that there is a sinister group of people called Team Galactic about. I think there’d be safety in numbers. Please, may I go through with you? 
[VAR(259, 0)] decided to go with Cheryl!
Cheryl: I’ll keep your Pokémon in perfect health.
Cheryl: Oh, hi, [VAR(259, 0)]! I’ve been waiting like I said. Let’s get through this forest together. 
Cheryl: Oh? Are you going back? I’ll wait here for you, then. 
Cheryl: Oh! There’s the exit! I’m so relieved... We finally got here. I would’ve never been able to get through this by myself. Thank you so much, [VAR(259, 0)]! 
I’m sure we’ll meet again somewhere! Bye for now! 
My Pokémon got poisoned, and now it can’t battle. I knew I should’ve loaded up on Antidotes at the Poké Mart!

Gardenia: Hiya! Were you intrigued by the rumors going around, too? 
You know, people’ve been talking about the ghost Pokémon of the Old Chateau. I’ve been hearing rumors about sinister shadows, too. 
I should check it out myself, but going in there is... ...Well, you know, being that I’m a Gym Leader, I’m always busy. So, since I’m so busy, I can’t go in. It’s not because I’m s-scared! S-so, good luck with your investigation!

...You are? OK, you’re [VAR(259, 0)]. I’m Riley. I’m a Trainer, and yes, it is a bit odd that I would be training here. If you’d like, we could team up. The wild Pokémon here are restless. 
[VAR(259, 0)] decided to go with Riley!
Riley: If your Pokémon get hurt, I’ll heal them up.
Riley: Hi, [VAR(259, 0)]. Let’s team up. The Pokémon seem to be restless. 
Riley: ...Are you going back? I’ll be hanging around here. It would be good if you came back. 
Riley: I get it now. You’re responsible for agitating the Pokémon. I don’t care what good reason you may have, but I don’t want you bringing any trouble into my mine. 
Grunt 1: We’re Team Galactic! We’ll take all the Pokémon we want! Isn’t that right, partner? 
Grunt 2: You said it, brother! So that’s what we’re gonna do! We’re abducting all the Pokémon from this rusted-out Iron Island! 
Riley: To share in all the joys and all the sorrows... That is how all the Trainers and Pokémon live in Sinnoh! I won’t allow anyone to defy that code of ethics! Come on, [VAR(259, 0)]! This is one battle we can’t lose! 
Grunt 1: Stop! I said stop! Your combination is so sick! The both of you, and your Pokémon... Let’s beat it, partner! 
Grunt 2: You said it, brother! We don’t even know what Team  Galactic’s big plan is anyway! 
Riley: Thanks. You really helped me out. Listen, I have a Pokémon Egg here. Would you take it with you?
Riley: Thanks! I’d like you to show the Pokémon that’s inside the Egg all sorts of new places. 
Riley: Thank you... But you don’t have room to take another Pokémon. All right, then. I’ll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you’ll accept it as a token of our friendship. 
Riley: Spending time with you was very enjoyable. I intend to test my skills in other places from now on. Let’s meet again! Take care on the way out.
                              
                                 
Riley: Haha, I’d have to agree. People training here would be those with too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly thriving ore mine once upon a time. I guess the steel ore’s played out. There’s only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron? The Leader of Canalave Gym? He’s asked me to become a Gym Leader, but there’s his son Roark to consider.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like for a Steel-type Pokémon user to battle a Steel type. Would that be like battling yourself, I wonder? I mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat one’s self than anyone else.
Riley: What’s going on here, though? The native Pokémon are restless... I don’t like this... Let’s hurry.

I’ve been left in charge of this HQ building and the remnants of the membership... The decision on what Team Galactic should do rests with me...

Boss: ...I see. You must be the Trainer I’ve been hearing about. The foolhardy one that’s trying to stand up to Team Galactic. Although I’d hardly expected to see that the Trainer is a mere child. I’d heard that our Commanders had a rough time with you... 
I know why you’re here, I can sense it in you. It’s about UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF, correct? You want to save them... I no longer have any need for them. I am finished with them. If your heart aches to save them, go right ahead, I could care less. It will save me the trouble of disposing of them. But, I must say... You are a remarkable specimen. Those Pokémon have nothing to do with you, do they not? But still you came to rescue them out of pity? Such pitifully useless emotions... It’s illogical and irrational. Pity and compassion are products of the weak and lacking human heart. You were compelled to come here by such vacuous sentimentality! I will make you regret paying heed to your heart! 
Boss: I see. You are indeed strong. And the basis of your power is your compassion toward Pokémon. ...How wasteful... Such emotions are but mere illusions. And, like all illusions, they fade over time until death banishes them forever. That is why I have abandoned all emotions as useless sentimentality. ...But that doesn’t matter. I doubt you will ever understand my position. That said, I recognize that you are strong and courageous to come alone. This is your reward. 
Boss: The Master Ball is the ultimate Poké Ball. It will unfailingly catch any Pokémon in the wild. But it is not anything that I require. Unlike you Trainers, I do not make Pokémon my friends or partners. Unlike other Team Galactic members, I don’t use Pokémon as tools. Instead, I make the power of Pokémon my own. 
If you wish to save the Pokémon from the lakes, take the warp panel ahead. I am off to Mt. Coronet. That’s correct. Mt. Coronet. Where you and I first met. I will ascend the mountain to its peak and put an end to everything... No. I will bring about a new beginning for everything...

Team Galactic Report 
Which report would you like to read?
Some say the universe originated from a massive explosion. Similarly, Sinnoh is thought to have been formed by an explosion in ancient times. Needless to say, the explosion came from the power of a Pokémon. The Pokémon must have been the mythical creature considered a deity by the ancients. Our aim is not to capture the mythical Pokémon, but to obtain its power... The PC entry ends there... 
The mythical Pokémon... According to myths, the Pokémon created Sinnoh with its power. However, capturing the Pokémon with a Poké Ball prevents it from using its full power... But with the Red Chain, the Pokémon can be shackled, and its power can be used without restraint... The PC entry ends there... 
The Red Chain... The Pokémon of the three lakes and Mt. Coronet are somehow connected. Capturing the Pokémon of the lakes will free the Pokémon of Mt. Coronet. From the Pokémon of the lakes, crystals can be extracted to create a Red Chain. Using that Red Chain, the mythical Pokémon can be summoned and shackled to do as we command... The PC entry ends there...

The Pokémon of the three lakes are connected somehow. Thanks to Saturn’s grandstanding at Lake Valor, a cavern appeared here. It was the cavern where the Pokémon MESPRIT slept.

What? You don’t have the Marking Map? ...You should occasionally pay visits to the Pokétch Company, you know. 
Go on, [VAR(259, 0)]. I’m sure that you will keep meeting countless Pokémon and people. Those encounters will keep thrilling you in their own special ways. I hope you’ll enjoy that experience! Take care, [VAR(259, 0)].

Even Team Galactic has no use for MAGIKARP! Worthless, all of them!
Hahaha! Next stop, Lake Verity! The closest civilization is that hick town called Twinleaf! We can roll in there completely unopposed!

[VAR(259, 0)]: What’d I say? I told you I’ll be OK by myself. If you haven’t gone yet, go challenge the Sunyshore Gym. I have a feeling things are going to keep getting tougher. It could be rough if you don’t collect up some Gym Badges.

Oh? Don’t I know you? We met in Eterna City. Listen. Team Galactic is going to do something huge for everyone’s sake. That’s why you should keep out of Team Galactic’s way. Don’t come whining about poor Pokémon and other trivial junk like that. Don’t waste your time coming to our HQ in Veilstone. Now, if you’ll excuse me.

What I most care about is the crushing power of my darling Pokémon. Are there any prizes that would help them get more power?
How’s it going? If things aren’t going well, why not grab some prizes here? It might toughen up your Pokémon just enough to do better.
Gramma, Gramma! I went and traded! You can have this, Gramma! 
Oh, what is it, dear? Oh, a Sludge Bomb... Why, thank you so much, dear. You’re such a cute, tough, and kind girl... I feel blessed to have a grandchild like you...

Welcome to the Battle Tower! I am your guide to the Multi Battle Rooms. 
Would you like to take the Multi Battle Room challenge?
                          
The Battle Tower’s Multi Battle Rooms are facilities for conducting Multi Battles. For Multi Battles, you must partner with a Trainer in the tower and enter with two Pokémon each. Inside the tower is a room named the Battle Salon where you can meet other Trainers. There, you must find a Trainer to act as your partner in the Multi Battles. Once you have partnered up, you will be shown to a Multi Battle Room. In the Multi Battle Room, seven tag teams await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven teams, you will earn Battle Points. If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. Also, if you are in a tag team with a friend, you may not interrupt your challenge. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                
Would you like to communicate with a friend and form a tag team?
One Trainer should select “BECOME LEADER.” The other Trainer must select “JOIN GROUP.”

Welcome to the Battle Tower! I am your guide to the Wi-Fi Battle Rooms. 
Would you like to take the Wi-Fi Battle Room challenge?
The Battle Tower’s Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are places to conduct battles over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (WFC). In Wi-Fi Battles, you will be battling Trainers from around the world over Nintendo WFC. Inside the Battle Tower, there are many Battle Rooms. In each of the Battle Rooms, seven Trainers await your challenge. If you manage to defeat all seven, you will earn Battle Points. Depending on how you do, you may even become the room’s leader! Also, the Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are operated on a ranking system. Trainers will go up in rank if they keep winning Wi-Fi Battles. Contrarily, their rankings could go down if they lose consistently. To raise your rank, keep winning, especially against tougher Trainers. If you want to interrupt your challenge, please save the game. If you don’t save, you will be disqualified from your challenge. 
We hope to see you again!

Hi, there! Can you tell me how you’d introduce yourself before a battle, and what you’d say if you won or lost?
OK! So, how would you introduce yourself before a battle?
OK! So, what would you say if  you lost a battle?
OK! So, what would you say if  you won a battle?
Thanks for telling me. You’d say “[VAR(284)]”...
Oh? You’re not going to tell me? That’s too bad...
There doesn’t appear to be any data yet... 
DS Wireless Communications will be launched.
We look forward to your next visit.

Congratulations on your winning streak, challenger! The Tower Tycoon has sent word that he is impressed with you. He recognizes your skill, and he’d like to challenge you to a battle! Are you ready to battle the Tower Tycoon?
Hi! My name’s Palmer. I remember you from when you were in Twinleaf, [VAR(259, 0)]. You were always playing with my son [VAR(259, 1)], right? You’ve grown up since then, and most impressively, too! So, I’d like you to show me. Show me the bond you’ve built with your Pokémon. Show me the skill you’ve acquired as a Trainer! 
Palmer: So, you’ve come this far! As the Tower Tycoon, I’ll have to give you my best effort. That’s how the best Trainers show respect to each other. By battling all out as dedicated students of Pokémon! 
Bravo! One day, I imagine my son will come challenge me just as you have. That’s something I look forward to a great deal. You will become even more skilled, the very same way your father did. Keep battling Trainers from around the world and keep growing greater in stature! 
Bravo! I feel inspired in my heart! It brings back a memory of that day long ago... I went out to the lake with your father that day... We were attacked by a wild Pokémon. We fended it off, but I don’t recall  how. It was that desperate. That was my first step as a Trainer. I wonder if the professor is doing well? ...That’s enough reminiscing. My young friend, the world and your future hold infinite promise. Go on, you can be all that you desire! There is no limit to where you can go!

Thank you so much for participating! Please wait while I save the game. Don’t turn off the power.

Would you like to save and quit the game?
Would you like to cancel your Battle Room challenge?

Awaiting response from a friend...

Please find a partner from the Trainers that are gathered here. 
[VAR(259, 0)], you have not found a partner for your tag team. Would you like to quit looking and return to the reception counter?
Thank you for choosing a partner. I will now show you to your Multi Battle Room. 
Riley: The partners I have now? Well, my [VAR(256, 0)]’s nasty with its [VAR(262, 1)]. And there’s my [VAR(256, 2)], which is a sure hand with [VAR(262, 3)]. Would you like to team up with me?
Riley: ...Oh, is that so? That’s too bad.
Riley: Ahaha, thanks. I’ll be waiting for you. 
Cheryl: I have [VAR(256, 0)] that is very good with [VAR(262, 1)], and [VAR(256, 2)] that likes to show off its [VAR(262, 3)]. Will you team up with me again?
Cheryl: Oh... Too bad...
Cheryl: I’ll go on ahead, then. 
Buck: Yo, are you looking to team up? Let me tell you what I’ve got. My [VAR(256, 0)]’s first-rate with [VAR(262, 1)]. And my [VAR(256, 2)] is the best when it comes to using [VAR(262, 3)]. You want to go with me, don’t you?
Buck: Huh? What? That’s pretty cold of you!
Buck: Hehehe! Good choice! There’s no problem when I’m around! 
Marley: ...My [VAR(256, 0)] uses [VAR(262, 1)] well... And my [VAR(256, 2)] likes to use [VAR(262, 3)]. ...What do you want? Am I supposed to go with you?
Marley: ...Whatever...
Marley: ...I’ll go ahead... 
Mira: Hi, hi! I’m with my [VAR(256, 0)]! It’s really good with [VAR(262, 1)]! The other one is my [VAR(256, 2)]. Its [VAR(262, 3)] is awesome! [VAR(259, 4)], do you want to go with me?
Mira: Oh, OK. Let’s go another time!
Mira: OK! I’ll wait for you! [VAR(259, 0)], don’t be long!

Hey! I’ve been waiting for you! Welcome to the Sinnoh region! This is a region of great natural beauty where Pokémon that have never been seen before can be found! Follow me! I’ll walk you through Jubilife City! 
You’ll find a cave if you walk straight down this road. You should go there and check it out! 
You’ll find a cave if you walk straight down this road. You should go there and check it out! 
A Pokémon Watch is for all Trainers! We call it a Pokétch for short! 
There are various Pokétch apps that you can add to it!

Wow! You’ve done a great job. I can sense that you could be a truly great Pokémon Trainer. You have the Thorn Pokémon ROSELIA. Some Pokémon that haven’t evolved in other regions might evolve here in the Sinnoh region. Hmm... Let’s see what happens with your ROSELIA...

Trainer Tip! All Pokémon that are involved in a battle earn Exp. Points! When those Exp. Points reach a certain amount, the Pokémon levels up and becomes stronger! 
Trainer Tip! A Pokémon’s health is called its Hit Points (HP). Be careful: if your Pokémon’s HP hits 0, it will no longer be able to battle! 
This is the end of the demo version.  We look forward to seeing you again soon!

Hi! How’s it going? You’re in the [VAR(317, 1)] group with [VAR(259, 0)] as leader, right? Would you like to leave that group and join another one?
Hi! How’s it going? You’re in the [VAR(317, 1)] group with [VAR(259, 0)] as leader, right? Would you like to leave that group and make a new one?
Hi, I know it’s a little sudden, but would you like to join a group? If you join a group, you can compete or cooperate with fellow members. It’s a lot of fun. Want to join? 
Which group would you like to join?
Oh. That’s too bad.
Oh, you want to make a new group? Sure thing! The group you made before will be disbanded, though. Is that OK?
Yay, cool! What do you want to name your group?
The [VAR(317, 0)] group, huh? That’s a great name! The leader is [VAR(259, 1)]. I hope the group gets more members.
The [VAR(317, 0)] group? [VAR(259, 1)] is the leader. Would you like to join this group?
OK! [VAR(259, 0)] is now a member of the [VAR(317, 1)] group.
When you form or join a new group, be sure to visit any Union Room. Mix your records with group members, and you’ll become integrated. When you’re in the same group, events can happen simultaneously. It makes things a lot more fun playing in a group! Anyone can make a group, and anyone can join. I hope you recruit lots of friends so everyone can have fun!

Welcome! This is the Global Trade Station, or GTS for short. We enable the trading of Pokémon with people worldwide over Nintendo WFC. Would you like to do a global Pokémon trade?
Hello! Welcome to the GTS! Would you like to do a global Pokémon trade over Nintendo WFC?
You may trade Pokémon one of two ways at the GTS. You may offer a Pokémon for trade, or search among offered Pokémon. Should I describe things in greater detail?
You will be asked to put up the Pokémon you are offering to trade. At that time, you will be asked what Pokémon you would like in return. If another player offers your desired Pokémon in return for your offered Pokémon, the trade will go through. Should I explain anything else?
You may search among the Pokémon that are offered by other Trainers. They will all identify what Pokémon their Trainers want back in return. If you find one that you want, you must provide us with the kind of Pokémon wanted in return. Should I explain anything else?
Would you like to make a global Pokémon trade?
Please do visit again.
I hope you enjoy your visit to the GTS!
That’s a big globe, eh? Where do I live on it now? Let’s see if I can point it out...
They say if you communicate with someone, their location is recorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon here to trade. Who knows, it might be traded while I’m asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with Pokémon fans from around the world. Isn’t that something?
You can register where you live on this giant globe. Once you do, your location will be displayed to anyone you communicate with.
Is Nintendo WFC something even I can use easily? If it is really that easy, I’d love to trade Pokémon, too!

Rowan: Ah, [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve come to show me the progress you’ve made on your Pokédex?
Hmm... You’ve spotted [VAR(308, 0)] Pokémon in Sinnoh... 
What’s wrong? You’re not suggesting you’ve seen so few that you’re afraid to show me?
Rowan: You’re working hard on your National Pokédex I see. I expect big things from you!
I see! You’ve met all the Pokémon there are in Sinnoh! [VAR(259, 0)], I need to see you at my lab. I’ll be waiting!
I see! You’ve met all the Pokémon there are in Sinnoh!
Look harder for wild Pokémon. Don’t be afraid of going into tall grass.
Your pace is picking up. Things can only get better!
Be persistent when you’re searching for Pokémon that appear only in certain places.
Pokémon aren’t hiding only in tall grass. You can find many others in caves and seas.
Your Pokédex is looking more and more respectable!
Are you fishing with rods? Pokémon that live underwater need to be caught by fishing.
The Trainers that challenge you to battle have Pokémon, obviously. They may have rare ones with them, and that can add to your Pokédex.
Your Pokédex is well on the way to being filled up. This Pokédex can be considered a journal of your adventure.
You’re not far from seeing every Pokémon there is to see in Sinnoh!
Oak: Ah, [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve come to show me how your Pokédex is coming along?
Oak: Ah, [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve come to show me how your Pokédex is coming along?
Hmhm... You’ve caught [VAR(308, 0)] so far... 
I see... Come see me if you’d like me to have a look at your Pokédex.
They say there are at least 400 species of Pokémon nationwide. If you’re planning to catch them all, you’d better be a committed Trainer.
Hm! Little by little, you’re filling the Pokédex with complete data on Pokémon you’ve gotten. Keep up the good work!
Here’s a tip on catching Pokémon in the wild. Minimize their HP before you throw out your Poké Ball to catch ’em.
Remember: If you can’t catch them, you can always trade for them. As soon as you trade, the Pokémon’s data is added to the Pokédex. That’s why you should seek out as many trades as possible.
Have you visited the Great Marsh? Some Pokémon only appear in places such as that.
As you know, there are Pokémon that eventually evolve. That’s an important thing to consider when you’re filling your Pokédex.
You’ve proven yourself capable. There’s nothing to worry about. Keep catching Pokémon the way you’ve been doing so far.
Are you aware that there is more than one style of evolution? There are some Pokémon that evolve by becoming friends with the Trainer.
Apparently, there are some Pokémon that appear in swarms on occasion. Don’t miss out on these massive outbreaks of Pokémon!
Amazing! You’ve already gotten over 300 Pokémon! That’s already a major achievement, but I know you’re capable of more!
Some wild Pokémon only appear during certain times of the day. You’ll need to look for Pokémon around the clock.
I’ve been getting reports of different Pokémon sightings. By different, I mean Pokémon that aren’t native to the Sinnoh region. You should perhaps go back to areas you’ve already scoured. You may end up seeing Pokémon that weren’t there before.
[VAR(259, 0)], have you visited the Pal Park recently? There still may be Pokémon that are rarely seen in Sinnoh.
[VAR(259, 0)], have you visited the Pal Park recently? There still may be Pokémon that are rarely seen in Sinnoh.
Hm! Your Pokédex is getting closer to completion. Have you ever considered a career as a Pokémon professor?
Hmm... You’ve caught quite the impressive collection of Pokémon. You’ve obviously had to employ many means to seek them all out. Keep an eye out for rustling tall grass and search it thoroughly.
I can only marvel at the diversity of Pokémon. I’m still very much in awe of them.
Good, good, you’re getting close to completing the Pokédex. I’m looking forward to seeing its completion. When that happens, your views about Pokémon will likely have changed!
Hmm... You are so very close to completing your Pokédex. Think about what’s missing. Recall what you’ve overlooked. You’re so close--please finish the Pokédex!
[VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve finally done it! You’ve finally completed the National Pokédex! This is better than meeting any exotic Pokémon for the first time! I feel blessed to have become friends with a Trainer like you! Sincerely, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!

Hello there! It’s so very nice to meet you! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! 
My name is Rowan. However, everyone just calls me the Pokémon Professor. Before I go any further, is this your first adventure? If you need advice, I’m certainly capable of giving it. 
Moves the main character. Also used to choose various headings and selections.  Used to confirm a choice, check things, chat, and scroll text.  Used to exit, cancel a choice, and cancel a mode.
Press to open the menu.  Press to use an item, such as a Bicycle, that has been registered in advance.
The lower screen is called the Touch Screen.  The Touch Screen will display a variety of touch buttons depending on the situation.

[VAR(512, 0)]
Do you understand everything so far?[VAR(512, 0)]
Please touch a button on the Touch Screen below.[VAR(512, 0)]
Would you like to know more about anything else? 
You are about to enter a world where you will embark on a grand adventure of your very own.
Speak to people and check things wherever you go, be it in towns, roads, or caves. Gather information and hints from every possible source.
New paths will open to you when you help people in need, overcome challenges, and solve mysteries.
At times, you will be challenged by others to a battle. At other times, wild creatures may stand in your way.  By overcoming such hurdles, you will gain great power.
However, your adventure is not solely about becoming powerful.
On your travels, we hope that you will meet countless people and, through them, achieve personal growth.  This is the most important objective of this adventure.
This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon. 
Here, I have a Poké Ball. Touch the button on the middle of the Poké Ball, if you’d please.[VAR(512, 0)]
No, no! Not that button! The button on the Poké Ball.[VAR(512, 0)]
We humans live alongside Pokémon as friends. At times we play together, and at other times we work together. Some people use their Pokémon to battle and develop closer bonds with them. What do I do? I conduct research so that we may learn more about Pokémon. 
Now, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
Are you a boy? Or are you a girl? 
All right, so you’re a boy? 
All right, so you’re a girl? 
Tell me, what is your name? 
Your name is [VAR(259, 0)]? 
Your name is [VAR(259, 0)]? 
OK... So, you’re [VAR(259, 0)]? A fine name that is! Now, this boy here... I believe he’s your friend. 
What might his name be? 
[VAR(259, 1)], is it? That’s your friend’s name? 
All right, [VAR(259, 0)], the time has come. Your very own tale of grand adventure is about to unfold. On your journey, you will meet countless Pokémon and people. I’m sure that along the way you will discover many things, perhaps even something about yourself. Now, go on, leap into the world of Pokémon!

...Pant...pant... ...Why am I running like this anyway?! That new universe that the boss was talking about... It’s giving me goose bumps thinking about it... So, we use this... 
Gweh! You were eavesdropping! I was only talking to myself! You’re persistent, too... I’m pooped out from all the running... But, I’m not... Going to battle you... 
Aww, no... You’re still on my tail...? The lake’s within sight... You leave me no choice... My Pokémon will KO you... 
I can’t battle anymore... I’m running on fumes... I’ll have to give this to the Commander... I wish... I got to use it at the lake... 
Cynthia: Oh, hello, long time no see! How is your Pokédex filling up? I came to research the folklore about the lake, but... Well, it doesn’t appear as if the lake is open to the public now. Have you heard the folklore about it? They say there is an island inside the lake. And inside that island is a mirage of a Pokémon. No one must enter the chamber of that Pokémon... Sorry to change the subject, but have you seen the group of PSYDUCK on Route 210?
Cynthia: Yes, that’s right. By the cafe on Route 210. You’ve seen that group of PSYDUCK huddled with their heads in their, uh, hands...? 
Cynthia: You haven’t seen them? By the cafe on Route 210. There’s a group of PSYDUCK huddled with their heads in their, uh, hands...? 
Anyway, what you should do is use this medicine on the PSYDUCK. You’re working on a Pokédex, so it would be worthwhile for you. 
Cynthia: I went on a big adventure with a Pokédex when I was younger. I hope you get to meet every kind of Pokémon there is to see. It may help you with the secret of the mirage Pokémon. See you later! 
We’ve been asked to keep everyone out of the lake area. Reason? I’m not too sure, but apparently to protect the lake.
To protect the lake... It’s nice to know there are still people worth admiring like that. I believe his name was Cyrus?
Stop, stop! Yes, you! Sunyshore City, which is down this road, had a major blackout! Crews are working on restoring power, but the road’s closed now. 
Stop, stop! Yes, you! Sunyshore City, which is down this road, had a major blackout! Crews are working on restoring power, but the road’s closed now.
What am I to do...? I’ve gone and dropped my Suite Key somewhere again... The hotel people won’t be happy with me... I’m sure I had it when I left the reception counter earlier...
What am I to do...? I’ve gone and dropped my Suite Key somewhere again... Oh! That’s my Suite Key! You found it for me? Oh, that’s sweet of you! Thank you! 
Seven Stars Restaurant More Flavor Than You Can Wish For

===============================
Text File: 355
===============================
At our restaurant, you can enjoy more than just exquisite dining. You may also partake in battles. Bon appetit!
I am so sorry. We are now closed. Please do visit while we are open. 
Before we make our toast, I’d hoped for a battle... However, you seem to be short a Pokémon for that.
If you want to have a battle with us, you’ll need to bring more Pokémon.
With someone as beautiful as you for my model, I am sure to paint a masterpiece! 
What is it? Do you wish for a battle? 
                                               
Though we lost our battle... A toast to your beauty, that no painting could ever hope to capture!
He said he’d treat me to a dinner here if I agreed to model for him. So, I came along, but I haven’t made up my mind yet. 
When I can’t decide, I battle to make the decision! 
                                                           
I’ve decided to model for him. That’s given me an appetite!
There is no price too high for the sake of my art... That said, my oh my, these meals look awfully pricey... 
What is it? Are you feeling hungry, too? Oh, I see, that’s not it! You wanted a battle! 
                                           
My hors d’oeuvres have gone cold...
I have to slow down on eating these delicious hors d’oeuvres. I don’t want to be all bloated by the time the main dish comes. 
I’d like a light battle to work up my appetite. Would you care to join us? 
                                                                  
The hors d’oeuvres haven’t grown cold... These are supposed to be served chilled!
The worth of a meal isn’t determined merely by its flavor. Presentation, that is, color and placement, is vital. In other words, a fine meal can be likened to the finest work of art... 
And in Pokémon battles, I also hope to see beauty. You do agree with me, yes? 
                                                                                                 
The meals prepared here are not merely tasty, they are also healthy. Diners need not worry about ruining their figures eating here.
Today’s main dish is scrumptiously delicious! If I can keep eating this food, I’ll model anytime I can! 
I feel guilty just eating all this delicious food like this. I’ll join in the battle, too! 
                                                              
The models of great paintings were often rather plump. That means I can keep eating without obsessing over my figure!
If you want to challenge us, bring some more Pokémon.
If you want to battle us, you have to have at least two Pokémon!
Actually, my father happens to be the chef here. 
What is it? A battle? Bahaha... You think you can beat me? 
                           
We’ve lost, but let’s make a toast to our future together anyway!
Oh, my! Your father is the chef here? How wonderful! 
I haven’t told him, but my father owns the hotel and restaurant... Oh, but that’s beside the point. Would you care for a battle? 
                                           
Let’s make a toast to the prosperity of the restaurant!
I have to hand it to my father-- these hors d’oeuvres are delicious! 
...Are you maybe asking me for a battle? Well, certainly! I never back down from a challenge! 
                            
Finally. Now we can go about enjoying our meal without disruption.
Yes! This meal is good enough to serve at the hotel. 
Please don’t tell my date that my father owns the restaurant. I’ll have a battle with you if you keep your mouth shut.
                            
My date did his best, but you were better than the both of us.
Fufufu, my date’s really enjoying my dad’s cooking. She has a dreamy expression after every bite! 
I’m feeling great! Sure, I’ll have a battle with you. That’s why you approached us, right? 
                                 
My prowess as a Trainer isn’t up to snuff... It’s not like my father’s scrumptious cooking...
This succulent flavor! It reminds me of a world trip I took. My father and I traveled everywhere dining at only the best restaurants. 
Eating this fabulous meal has really lifted my spirits. Join us for a battle? 
                                                        
Your father’s cooking has a very magical quality to it. It seems to perk people up with energy.
If your intention is to test your skill on us, I daresay you ought to bring at least another Pokémon.
Oh, you’re offering to do battle with us? How nice of you. Unfortunately, you simply cannot battle us both with just one Pokémon.
Let me propose a toast to many more happy years together. 
Since I took my retirement, I’ve been traveling with my wife. We both enjoy searching for delicious dining experiences. You seem to enjoy battling with Pokémon. Am I right? 
                               
Well, so much for that. Let’s try to enjoy the rest of our meal.
To our health, welfare, and to fine dining! Cheers! 
A toast before a meal helps stimulate the appetite, I find. But that’s neither here nor there. You wanted a battle, surely?
                        
Gourmet dining in restaurants and exhilarating Pokémon battles... There is so much contentment in my life!
Hmm! Now, this is special! It appears as if it were only grazed with fire, but in reality, much care has gone into its preparation! 
When you get to be an accomplished gourmet like myself, one can tell at a glance if a dish is delicious or not. You would battle against such a discerning gourmet? 
                                                    
Well, so much for that. We’ll keep a stiff upper lip and look forward to enjoying the main course.
These hors d’oeuvres are simply divine! They tell me that I can expect the main course to be fantastic! 
I thought the main course arrived already... You’re a Trainer seeking battle? 
                                                
The hors d’oeuvres were most excellent!
Hmm! The chef flambeed this to perfection! The rich aromas and flavors fill my mouth with joy! 
You’re throwing down a challenge in the middle of our meal? I would say you’re a very dedicated Trainer, especially for one so young! 
                                                      
Ah... I’m very satisfied with our meal and our battle.
...! This sauce! It’s a spicy sauce in Hoenn style made from grated Cheri Berries! 
Would you like to sample a bite? ... Oh, right. Pokémon? 
                                              
Battling is fine, of course. But for me, I would rather be out enjoying good meals.
If you want to battle us, you have to have two Pokémon.
Don’t you have two Pokémon? We’ll have to battle another time!
Alison, um, I, er... Thank you for coming today... Should we make a toast? 
She’s the girl from the Pokémon- goods shop I go to all the time. We’re incredibly happy together. Would you like to battle us? 
                                                   
Oh, no, I’m sorry we lost. Alison, you’re not upset?
Fufu... Eugene, you act so different from the way you do at the shop. You’re surprisingly shy. 
I work at a Pokémon-goods shop because I love Pokémon. The job lets me be with Pokémon all day long. It naturally made me pretty decent at battling. Want to try me? 
                                             
I don’t worry much about winning or losing. I keep my Pokémon with me because I love them!
If my Pokémon buddies hear I went on a date with you, Alison... They’re probably going to hate me for it... 
Are you Alison’s fan, too?
                                             
Alison, seeing your smiling face... I can’t tell if these appetizers are delicious or not!
Sorry? What? Date? Um... Eugene... You are a valued customer and all... 
...Even though I said that, I admit the invitation was flattering. So I accepted his invitation. I’ll let my Pokémon decide for my fickle heart. Let’s battle? 
                                            
You know, it is true what they say. There is no evil among Pokémon fans! That goes for you and Eugene!
Looks like our main course is here. Please, enjoy yourself. I’ve got the bill covered today! 
I’ll defeat you and collect the prize money! 
                                                         
My wallet’s empty after paying the prize money... Oh, no, it’s OK! No need to worry! I still have my secret stash of cash!
Eugene, I think you’re a little awkward, but you’re very earnest. 
If I team up with my date, it could be an interesting combination. I think we could battle in an intriguing manner. Do you? 
                                 
The meal was delicious, and our battle was so much fun. I really insist that we split the bill.
If you have two Pokémon, I’ll take you on with my mom.
I’m willing to have a battle with my son, my pride and joy. But you must bring more Pokémon than that.
What should I have today? Juice, ice cream, cake, and, and... 
Oh, hi, Trainer! Want to battle Pokémon with us before we have a yummy dinner? 
                                         
I don’t get it. Grown-ups always have a toast before eating. What’s that for? And I don’t see any bread?
My dear, Mommy is so proud of you for doing so well on your test. You may order anything you like. It’s your reward, dearest! 
Did you know? My boy is not only a genius at school, but he’s also a Pokémon prodigy! Would you like to challenge us and see? 
                                               
I wish to propose a toast. May my darling Esteban get another 100% on a test!
Wow, they bring out things one dish at a time! It’s not like how it is at home! 
I do my homework while eating. I can battle anytime! 
                                               
We’re going to eat this delicious stuff now. Bye-bye!
This restaurant is the talk of the town for the delicious food. 
I beg your pardon? You want a battle now? Well, that’s all right. It’s not as if I dislike it. 
                                 
Thank you for letting my dear son experience an invaluable lesson.
Do mothers and fathers go off to eat like this? I mean without taking their kids along. 
But that’s OK. It’s way more fun for me to battle than go eat fancy dinners! 
                                                  
Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
This is a special occasion, Esteban. This is to celebrate your great grades! 
Oh? A battle, you say? Well, certainly. Why not? 
                                               
Is the dessert coming soon?
My daughter and I always battle together, none of that one-on-one.
I can go against you with Papa. Please bring more Pokémon.
Here’s a toast for Mom. May she always be healthy! 
My wife’s in the hospital waiting for the baby to arrive. Since I can’t cook, I came here with my daughter. How would you like a battle with us before we eat? 
                         
The house will be a lot noisier when the baby comes home with Mommy.
I wonder what Mommy will bring home? A baby boy? A baby girl? 
A boy will be a brother, and a girl will be a sister. I’m going to be the older sister, so I should get better at Pokémon! 
                            
Little babies cry like Pokémon! Piyaaaah!
Wow... Look at these appetizers. This is just so extravagant. 
I’m no cook, I’ll admit that freely. But battling Pokémon... There’s something I’m comfortable with. 
                            
Let’s get over the sting of this loss by enjoying this delicious meal!
Wow! This food looks really fancy! 
Papa is a rotten cook, so we can go out and eat good food like this! Did you come to this restaurant to battle Pokémon? 
               
I’ve never eaten anything like this before.
Here’s the main dish! 
What is it? Did you want to battle with us? 
              
Jocelyn, I hope the new baby will be as kindhearted as you.
I wish Mommy were here to eat with us... 
Mommy gave me my Pokémon. Want to see how tough they are? 
                            
Next time, let’s come with everyone. The baby, too!
Yeah? What’s up? Did you want to be on TV, too? Oh, right, sorry! You wanted to battle! You’ll be battling the two of us. You need at least two Pokémon.
If you want an autograph, you’ll have to wait till we finish filming. Oh, and if you want to battle, bring two Pokémon, OK?
Let’s start with a shot of the drinks as a camera test. 
Hunh? You’re inviting us to battle at a time like this? 
                                          
Oh, man... Our drinks are lukewarm now.
Today’s featured drink is freshly squeezed juice made from ripened Pecha Berries picked this morning! 
Pardon? Pokémon? OK, a quick one before we do any filming for the show. 
                                             
Do you think we should rehearse this one more time? Today’s featured drink is freshly squeezed...
Hey, these appetizers sure do look delicious. Will someone bring me a mist spray so they look even fresher? 
Thanks, that was quick! ...Wait, where’s the mist spray? Oh, you want a battle? Whatever, then. I’m up for your challenge! 
                                                             
Photographing food isn’t easy. It’s actually very technical.
These look fabulous, too. We need the camera to zoom in more! 
Please don’t talk to me while we’re filming! Oh, actually, hold on. A Trainer barges in on our fine dining experience... I like that! It adds drama to our story! 
                               
Darling Darryl, are you ready? When I take a bite, I want a close-up of my lips, all right?
Whoa... So this is the main dish? Yowza! Let’s get this filming done quick so I can chow down, too! 
You’ve been sniffing around a lot... Are you messing with our filming? 
                                          
Oh, no... Everything’s gone cold while we were battling...
Chomp! Mmm... This is... Light, and yet rich flavored... It delectably melts away... A hint of an aftertaste, yet crisp... Neither too sweet nor too bitter... My words can’t do this justice! 
It’s not easy trying to describe food while you’re eating. But I can battle anytime during filming! 
                                                                                                   
Do you know what the most important thing is for gourmet reporting? It’s a...thesauruslike vocabulary!
I’ll only say this once, so listen closely. I’ll even say it slowly. To battle against two Trainers, you need two or more Pokémon. Now if you were to bring more Pokémon, I could consider a battle...
Oh, you’ll have to bring more Pokémon than that to battle us!
And another brilliant day on the markets! A toast to my Lady Luck! 
Since I’ve been with her, I’ve been riding a hot streak on the markets. I’m surfing on a wave of good luck! You’re sure you want to battle us? 
                            
This is just a minor setback. I can easily make up for this!
Ooh! All your stocks went up again? You haven’t guessed wrong yet! 
My boyfriend’s a stock market wizard! Did you know? Someone that lucky also happens to make a tough Trainer. Are you willing to try your luck against that? 
                          
It’s just one loss. We can make that back with a big win next time!
There’s no need for technique. You just have to read what’s in your opponent’s heart. 
When I say “heart,” I don’t mean what that person’s thinking. It’s about how they want to be perceived. Do you... Would you like me to think of you as a tough Trainer? 
                               
I had a bad feeling about this Trainer...
No, really? Ooeeeh! That is so neat! How can you tell these things? 
My boyfriend could tell that deep down, I’m actually a frightened and lonely child! I don’t think I could ever lose with him. Want to try? 
                            
It’s amazing that you predicted you would lose!
Let’s savor this extravagant meal and think of what it represents. We can use that as motivation to keep winning at life! 
Personally, I think there are two kinds of people. Those who face up to challenges and those who duck and cover. You’re the type who accepts challenges, am I right? 
                                        
If I had the power of premonition, I’d be a terror on the markets. But you know that’s not really possible.
How can you guess right about everything all the time? Do you really have the power of premonition? 
I’m convinced that he has some extrasensory power or something. I’m teaming up with a guy like that. Are you sure you want to do this? 
                                         
If it’s not premonition, did you... Maybe come from the future?
One Pokémon is insufficient if you want to battle against us.
If you’d bring two or more Pokémon, we could have a battle with you.
Hmm... This beverage’s coloration borders on the positively toxic... However, my analysis indicates that it is composed of natural ingredients. 
What is it? You are? ... ...Oh, yes, a Trainer. 
                                                               
The results of that battle are insignificant. Let’s drink up.
Oh, dear! I wish you wouldn’t! We’re at a fancy restaurant, and you want to analyze what’s served? 
Oh, you’re a Trainer? 
                                                        
Cheers, dear! Please don’t start analyzing what we just drank!
Interesting... These hors d’oeuvres are fascinating. Plant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%. Curious and curiouser... 
What is it now? Do you want me to analyze your skill level? 
                                                             
I feel compelled to analyze that which is unknown to me. By defining its composition, I feel reassured in my knowledge.
Oh, dear, must you go on that way? It takes the magic out of a meal. I wish you wouldn’t think about your research while we’re out eating! 
My husband never ceases to amaze me with his dedication to research. Would you care to have a battle with us? 
                                                      
If you were to ask me, I would rather not know about what I don’t understand. It’s simpler that way.
By my calculations, the main dish should have arrived by now. Perhaps the thermal setting is too low to prepare the food efficiently? 
You there! Let’s battle to consume time! 
                                                            
They brought the main course while we were battling... The calorie content appears to be alarmingly high.
There isn’t any point getting impatient over the food, dear. Isn’t this the sort of situation that you brought your Pokémon for? 
Oh, what good timing! Would you join us for a quick battle? 
                                                       
Oh, dear, if we take in too many calories, we can always work them off by battling!

Ciao! I’m the game director! You’re working on filling a Pokédex, aren’t you? It’s awesome that you’re going to meet lots of Pokémon. Come show me your Pokédex when you’ve filled it with tons of entries!
Ciao! I’m the game director! Your Pokédex is looking great! You’ve already met every Pokémon there is to meet in this region. I’m really impressed! Let me give you an award!
Ciao! I’m the game director! You’ve finally collected all the Pokémon in the world! Your Pokédex is completed! That’s outstanding work! The effort you went through getting this Pokédex together... It’s fantastic! Totally cool! Thank you very much! Please allow Game Freak to honor you with an award!
How did you meet all the Pokémon that filled your Pokédex? Did you work long and hard to catch and raise them? Did you receive them as gifts from friends? Maybe you got some in trades from around the world? Though everyone’s Pokédexes may look the same, the stories they contain are all unique.

We’re here to make sure Snowpoint’s Gym Leader doesn’t disturb us!
You’re here to see the lake Pokémon, too? You must be bored to fight your way through the snow to get here...
Standing guard is a very important assignment! I’ll make this a success and earn myself a CLEFAIRY!
The Pokémon of the three lakes appear to be connected somehow. When they blew up Lake Valor, a cavern appeared in the middle of this lake!
Lake Acuity ahead

Seal Master: Hmm... Remarkable... The [VAR(264, 1)] scattered on the Capsule... Though they may appear to have been randomly applied, you can’t fool me. The Seals are cleverly applied in a meticulously calculated manner... Hm! And what’s this?! The Pokémon inside...! It’s this [VAR(256, 2)]?! The Trainer crafted this Ball Capsule to best highlight the Pokémon’s emergence from the Ball! MC: There you have it! Even our Seal Master is impressed!

Wait... It can’t be... What is this?! The Pokémon inside...! It’s this [VAR(256, 2)]?! With this [VAR(256, 2)], this [VAR(264, 1)]’s placement actually enhances its beauty! Did [VAR(259, 0)] position this [VAR(264, 1)] intending to use the Capsule on the [VAR(256, 2)]? The cheekiness of it all! How dare that [VAR(259, 0)] pull such an insolent ruse! MC: There you have it! Even our Seal Master is upset! To see [VAR(259, 0)]’s Ball Capsules, challenge the Trainer to a battle! Let’s meet again, same channel, same time!

I said slot, not slop, Tanya! Nope, this is about [VAR(259, 0)]’s big day at the Game Corner. [VAR(259, 0)] started out with [VAR(311, 2)] Coins.

Serge: It’s time for Rack ’Em Up Records! Today, we’ll look at an amazing record set by a Berry master! Tanya: Berries? Is this a small record? Serge: No, no, Tanya! This isn’t about size!

Serge: No, no, Tanya! [VAR(257, 0)] isn’t eating the Berries! It’s about how many were picked!

Ace Trainer: Hey, how are y’all doing, Poké fans? Thanks for tuning in to the Matchup Channel! Hey, fans, you’ve all used [VAR(271, 0)]-type moves, right? They’re absolutely hopeless against [VAR(271, 1)]-type Pokémon! It’s a totally wasted effort, like the way other Trainers try to mess with me out of jealousy! That’s all for today, but don’t forget to send me fan mail! Give it to your bird Pokémon, then set them free into the skies! A chance encounter with greatness-- that’s me--is always possible!

Reporter: I’m bringing you this report from the second floor of Jubilife TV. I’m here to examine a recently added photo titled “[VAR(284, 1)]” which belongs to [VAR(259, 0)]. Oh, is this it here? Let’s see... The title “[VAR(284, 1)]” does sound fitting for this photo... But one can’t help but think perhaps a better title could have been found. All controversy aside, it’s certainly worth seeing. Please do visit!

You haven’t caught all your Pokémon yet, but... Would you like to retire from your Catching Show?
I see... I’m disappointed that you dropped out. Make up for it next time! 
That’s the spirit, [VAR(259, 0)]! I like how you don’t give up!
That’s the spirit, [VAR(259, 0)]! I like how you don’t give up!
                                    
Ding-dong! Congratulations! [VAR(259, 0)] has successfully caught the stocked Pokémon! 
                                    
                                      
Would you like to retire?
Let the countdown begin!
Three...
Two...
One...
Start!

[VAR(259, 0)]: Hey, if we run into a Pokémon, I’m gonna catch it somehow. Because I’m gonna be a Pokémon Trainer. You know what a Trainer does, right? Makes Pokémon battle and all that?
[VAR(259, 0)]: Pokémon all have different moves, huh? A Trainer makes his Pokémon battle by ordering them to use moves. That’s so awesomely cool.
[VAR(259, 0)]: I want Pokémon of my own, and not too soon, either. I’d be able to go everywhere with my Pokémon that way.
[VAR(259, 0)]: That lake has a mirage Pokémon living in it. Everyone says nothing lives there, but I know I’m right.
[VAR(259, 0)]: I’m gonna become a Pokémon Trainer for sure. Not just any Trainer either. I’m going to be the greatest ever. That’s my dream.
[VAR(259, 0)]: Hey, that’s enough talking already. I’m itching to get going to the lake. Come on, come on!
[VAR(259, 0)]: All right! Let’s move out! Hustle up!
[VAR(259, 0)]: We didn’t have any choice in using those people’s Pokémon, right? But these Pokémon belong to them... They’ll want them back, won’t they? But this is the first Pokémon I’ve ever battled with...
[VAR(259, 0)]: I wish I could grow tougher with this little guy...
[VAR(259, 0)]: I don’t feel like talking... Let’s go. ...Are we maybe walking slower than when we went to the lake?
Cheryl: Wait! Please wait, [VAR(259, 0)]! If you use an Escape Rope now, you know that you’ll leave me behind?
Cheryl: Wait! Please wait, [VAR(259, 0)]! If you use Teleport now, you know that you’ll leave me behind?
Cheryl: This place... They say it’s a haunted mansion... I’m sorry, but it’s too creepy. May we go, please?
Cheryl: It’s startling to see two wild Pokémon appearing at the same time.
Cheryl: My Pokémon is an excellent healer. But attacking isn’t its strong point.
Cheryl: [VAR(259, 0)], battling with you makes me feel elated. If I could predict what you’re about to do, we would make a fierce combo!
Cheryl: That’s some nice moss...
Mira: Are you going to use that? I will be left all alone...
Mira: Are you going to use that? I will be left all alone...
Mira: That isn’t the right way. I’ll be lost if we go down...
Mira: I like helpful Pokémon moves like Growl and Minimize. Those kinds of moves are my favorites.
Mira: This cave... It’s so easy to get confused here. Do you know where we are?
Mira: [VAR(259, 0)], did you get to be so good because you’re always with your Pokémon? Yes! That has to be it! I will try like you!
Riley: If you use that, I’ll have to wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: If you use that move, I’ll have to wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: Haha, I’d have to agree. People training here would be those with too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly thriving ore mine once upon a time. I guess the steel ore’s played out. There’s only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron? The Leader of Canalave Gym? He’s asked me to become a Gym Leader, but there’s his son Roark to consider as well.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like for a Steel-type Pokémon user to battle a Steel type. Would that be like battling yourself, I wonder? I mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat one’s self than anyone else.
Riley: What’s going on here, though? The native Pokémon are restless... I don’t like this... Let’s hurry.
Riley: Thanks. You really helped me out. Listen, I have a Pokémon here named Luca. Would you take it with you? 
Riley: Thanks! I want you to show Luca all sorts of worlds. 
Riley: Thank you... But you don’t have room to take another Pokémon. All right, then. I’ll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you’ll accept it as a token of our friendship.
Riley: Spending time with you was very enjoyable. I intend to test my skills in other places from now on. It would be great if we could meet again. 
Marley: ...Are you going to leave me here?
Marley: ...Are you going to leave me here?
Marley: ...Sorry, but I’m not going up.
Marley: ...It isn’t that way.
Marley: ...You’re very chatty...
Marley: ...The Pokémon among flowers...
Buck: Whoa, [VAR(259, 0)]! If you use that, me and my Pokémon will be left behind. Don’t do it!
Buck: Whoa, [VAR(259, 0)]! If you use that, me and my Pokémon will be left behind. Don’t do it!
Buck: Why do I like the volcano so much? I don’t really have a good reason for it, but I don’t really need one.
Buck: There’s no law that says I have to be tough or anything, but losing isn’t fair to my Pokémon. After all, they try so hard for me. I think it’s my responsibility as a Trainer to recognize their hard work.
Buck: My big brother’s one of the Elite Four. So, of course it’s only normal that I’d be better than ordinary folks. But that’s not what I want. I want to be tough on my own terms. It wouldn’t be fair to the Pokémon that chose to be with me.
Buck: It might be cool being a Gym Leader or one of the Elite Four... But, then again, it sounds like it’d be a lot of hard work!

Oh, hello! Right this way, please! 
Hello. I’m glad to meet you. My name is Teala, and I’m your guide to the Pokémon Wi-Fi Club. First, I need to give you this. 
That’s your Pal Pad. You may register your friends in it. Once registered, you may link with those friends over Nintendo WFC to trade Pokémon, battle, and so on. Would you like to know more?
You may meet people on the second floor of a Pokémon Center for trades or Colosseum battles. You may register such people as friends in your Pal Pad. You may also manually register friends by entering their Friend Codes into your Pal Pad. Would you like me to repeat that?
I hope you enjoy using Nintendo WFC!
Welcome to the Pokémon Center Wi-Fi Club! May I help you with anything?
Let me explain how the Pokémon Wi-Fi Club is set up. From the center counter, you may use Nintendo WFC. Over Nintendo WFC, you may conduct trades and battles with friends that you have registered in your Pal Pad.
Welcome to the Pokémon Wi-Fi Club! Would you like to use Nintendo WFC?
Please come again.
Would you like to launch Nintendo WFC?
Right this way, please. 
...Oh? I’m sorry, but you don’t have any friends registered in your Pal Pad. The Wi-Fi Club cannot be used if no friends are in your Pal Pad. Would you like to get your own Friend Code at least?
...Oh? I’m sorry, but you don’t have any friends registered in your Pal Pad. The Wi-Fi Club cannot be used if no friends are in your Pal Pad. Please register friends in your Pal Pad, and then come back.

It will forget the saying it now knows. Is that OK?
Press the A or B Button, then speak into the microphone. 
[VAR(257, 0)] learned a new saying!

Hello! Here you may cook Berries and turn them into Poffins. 
Would you like to cook alone or with other people?
DS Wireless Communications will be launched.
YES
NO
               
There isn’t a Berry to cook! 
The Poffin Case is full. 
Sorry, you must have a Poffin Case if you want to cook some Berries.
ALONE
IN A GROUP
INFO
EXIT
One person in the group needs to choose “BECOME LEADER.” Everyone else must choose “JOIN GROUP.”
        
       
   
                             
                          
  
   
                 
  
   
            
  
   
                       
                   
                
                                                       
                                      
Throw the Berry into the pot and get stirring! Watch for an arrow to show you which direction to stir. Be quick! If you stir too slowly, you’ll burn the batter. But not too quick! If you stir too fast, the batter will overflow. If you do well, you’ll cook up a delicious Poffin! You may cook alone or in a group of up to four people. With more cooks stirring, everyone will get more Poffins!
Please visit again whenever you get the urge to cook!

You win... [VAR(284, 0)]!
[VAR(284, 0)]  was the one thing I wanted to avoid...
Waaah! [VAR(284, 0)]!
I want to go home with [VAR(284, 0)]...
[VAR(284, 0)]! [VAR(284, 1)]!
Could it be...? [VAR(284, 0)]...?
[VAR(284, 0)]! How awful!
I was confident about [VAR(284, 0)], too.
You’re [VAR(284, 0)], aren’t you?
[VAR(284, 0)]! Can’t be anything else but.
I feel so helplessly angry... It’s [VAR(284, 0)]!
[VAR(284, 0)] makes me sad...
I feel sorry for [VAR(284, 0)]!
The way I feel now is [VAR(284, 0)]...

[VAR(259, 0)]: Hey, you saw that news report that was on TV, right? You know, “Search for the Red GYARADOS! The mysterious appearance of the furious Pokémon in a lake!” That show got me to thinking. I’ll bet our local lake has a Pokémon like that in it, too! So, that’s what we’re gonna do. We’ll go find a Pokémon like that!
[VAR(259, 0)]: Hey! Where are you wandering off to?! That mystery Pokémon on TV! It’s calling out to me! Forget about going back home! 
Remember what your mother said? Mom: “[VAR(259, 0)]! Don’t go into the tall grass! “Remember, wild Pokémon may attack you if you’re walking in tall grass. “It would be OK if you had your own Pokémon, but...”
[VAR(259, 0)]: Hey, it’s those people! Is that old guy staring at us? 
Professor: Hmm... I heard from [VAR(259, 0)] that you used our Pokémon? Let me see them, please. Hmm... [VAR(256, 1)] and [VAR(256, 2)]... ... Hmm... I see... That’s how it is... 
[VAR(259, 0)]! I’m going back to my lab! 
Dawn: Um... Yes! Professor, please wait for me! 
I think you should visit our lab later. OK, see you! 
Lucas: Uh... Yeah, of course! Professor, wait for me! 
You should visit us at our lab later, I think. We’ll be seeing you! 
[VAR(259, 0)]: What was all that craziness about? I mean, if he was angry, he could’ve just yelled at us, or whatever... And didn’t he want their Pokémon back...? [VAR(259, 1)]... We should go home, too... 
Wild Pokémon lurk in tall grass. They can come bursting out at any time. So, if you’re wanting to battle wild Pokémon, just walk in tall grass. If you want to avoid wild Pokémon, then stay out of the tall grass.
Hi! I work at a Pokémon Mart. Did you know that a Pokémon’s health is measured by Hit Points (HP)? If a Pokémon runs out of HP, it faints and can’t battle anymore. If a Pokémon’s HP gets low, you should heal it with a Potion. Here, let me give you a Potion as a free sample. First one’s free! It will automatically go in the Medicine Pocket of your Bag. 
You can find a Pokémon Mart in cities and most major towns.
That ledge is one way. Jump down for a shortcut to Twinleaf Town!
If your Pokémon’s health--that’s its HP--is getting low, you should go home and get some rest.
If your Pokémon’s health--that’s its HP--is getting low, you should go to a Pokémon Center!

Dawn: You should go tell your family that you’re helping the professor. The faster the better, too. 
Dawn: Oh, that’s right! [VAR(259, 1)], I haven’t shown you how to catch a Pokémon. I’ll demonstrate how to catch  one, so just watch me, OK? 
Dawn: Giggle... See? Isn’t it neat? Actually, it’s better to lower your target’s HP more than I did. It’s important to get the Pokémon’s HP down as low as possible. This is because a healthy Pokémon is very difficult to catch. Oh, Pokémon also get easier to catch if you make them sleep or something by using a Pokémon’s move. OK, [VAR(259, 0)], to get you started, I’ll give you five Poké Balls! 
If you have lots of Pokémon with you, it will be safer on long trips. Plus, it will be a lot more fun having your Pokémon friends along. OK, I need to get going. Bye, now! 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1)]?! Did you tell your family that you’re helping the professor? ...I bet you didn’t, did you? I know that you’re eager to see all kinds of Pokémon. But you shouldn’t make your mom worry that you’ve upped and left. 
Lucas: Why don’t you go tell your family that the professor asked for your help? You should do it right away. 
Lucas: [VAR(259, 1)], do you know how to catch a Pokémon? I’ll demonstrate how to catch one, so just watch, OK? 
Lucas: And that’s how it’s done. Actually, I should have lowered the target’s HP some more. Yup, the important thing is to lower the Pokémon’s HP as much as possible. See, a healthy Pokémon isn’t easy to catch. Oh, yeah. They also get easier to catch if you make one of your Pokémon put them to sleep or such. Here, [VAR(259, 0)], I’ll give you five Poké Balls to get you started. 
If you have lots of Pokémon with you, you’ll be able to travel farther. That way, you’ll have a better shot at meeting more Pokémon. See you around!

Are you raising different kinds of Pokémon? If you only have the same type of Pokémon, you’ll have a hard time against types it’s weak to.
Hi, are you the flirty type? I’m asking you this to make a point. I teach at the Trainers’ School, and I’d like to give you a lesson. But before I do, I’d like you to have this TM. 
You know how Pokémon have genders? Like, there are males and females? Well, the move Captivate only works against the opposite gender. For example, it only works when used by a male Pokémon on a female. The move sharply lowers the target’s Special Attack, or Sp. Atk for short. You also probably know this, but a TM is good for only one use. Choose the Pokémon wisely if you do decide to use it.

Lucas: The [VAR(280, 1)] is... Just try touching it. It’ll alert you if there is an unseeable item on the ground. It’s especially handy for finding things in dark caves. OK, keep working on your Pokédex. Professor Rowan is counting on us!

Everyone seems to call me the Berry Master. I hand out Berries daily because I want people to learn how wonderful they are. You’re deserving of one! 
Berries are gifts of nature. I encourage you to feed Berries to Pokémon. That will make Pokémon happy. Seeing that, people will be motivated to plant more Berries. And that will make Sinnoh a greener, more natural place.
Are you the forgetful type who forgets where Berries are planted?
Yes, yes, I thought so! I’m the same way! I feel a sort of kinship with you! You can have this Pokétch app! 
Oh, is that so. Then you’re OK even if I don’t give you this nice thing.
The [VAR(280, 0)] shows you where there are ripe Berries that are ready to be picked.

Try fishing wherever there is a body of water. Oh, incidentally, do you need me to explain how to use that fishing rod?
You don’t like to fish?
First, you face any body of water, then you use your fishing rod. Next, you must focus! If a Pokémon bites, “!” appears. That’s your cue to reel it in!
When you’re fishing for Pokémon, the first hurdle is getting a bite. When you start to reel that Pokémon in, you’ve got to battle it. So, fishing gives you twice the fun!
Do you jog every morning? Well, I do!
When I was jogging the other day, a wild Pokémon chased after me. I swear, I ran on top of the water! I was so freaked out!

Well, perhaps if you change your mind, do come back.

Fine, fine, now pick the Pokémon I should teach the move to.

Why bother traveling afar when Pokémon are attracted by my garden? They come to me in hopes of seeing the garden! Well, doesn’t that make you envious? You are envious, yes?

Dr. Footstep: Pokémon are quite easy for me to read. I need only to see their footprints, and their innermost thoughts are revealed to me! Oh? You are skeptical of my claim? Then, let your [VAR(256, 0)] walk in front of me, right here. From its footprints, I will determine how it feels about you. 
Dr. Footstep: Do you want to check the feelings of your Pokémon again? Then, let your [VAR(256, 0)] walk in front of me, right here. From its footprints, I will determine how it feels about you. 
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what your [VAR(256, 0)] thinks of you.

Aww... [VAR(259, 1)] only plays with other Pokémon... [VAR(257, 2)] feels neglected... Maybe [VAR(259, 1)] doesn’t like [VAR(257, 2)] very much? [VAR(257, 2)] will try harder for [VAR(259, 1)]. Please be nicer to me! 
Others say there are people who aren’t very nice to Pokémon. I wonder about [VAR(259, 1)]... Will [VAR(259, 1)] look after [VAR(257, 2)] nicely? Will I get to go all over with this Trainer? Can we be... Friends? 
This adventure with [VAR(259, 1)] is lots of fun. [VAR(257, 2)] gets to go places where I can’t go by myself. I get to battle Pokémon I’ve never ever seen before. I’m gonna get stronger and stronger for [VAR(259, 1)]! 
[VAR(257, 2)] and [VAR(259, 1)] make a perfectly matched combo! I’ve seen all sorts of people so far... But [VAR(259, 1)] understands [VAR(257, 2)]’s feelings most! I’m a little hungry... You can tell, right? 
If I said there can be friendship between Pokémon and people, will [VAR(256, 0)]’s friends understand? But if you see [VAR(259, 1)] and [VAR(257, 2)], you will understand. Because [VAR(259, 1)] and [VAR(257, 2)] are friends! 
[VAR(257, 2)] is bored... Play with me more, more... [VAR(257, 2)] and [VAR(259, 1)], let’s play nicer... 
Gonna go with [VAR(259, 1)] all over the place... Be nice to [VAR(257, 2)]... Warm and cuddly... 
[VAR(257, 2)] get strong, make [VAR(259, 1)] happy. Round ones, square ones, triangle ones, wobbly ones... [VAR(257, 2)] wants to see different kinds of Pokémon... 
[VAR(257, 2)] and [VAR(259, 1)] make a friendly combo. [VAR(259, 1)]’s feelings, [VAR(257, 2)] can understand. [VAR(257, 2)]’s feelings, [VAR(259, 1)] understands! 
[VAR(259, 1)] makes [VAR(257, 2)] very proud! [VAR(256, 0)] boasts to friends about [VAR(259, 1)]! [VAR(259, 1)] and [VAR(257, 2)] are best of friends! 
Why does [VAR(259, 1)] use only other Pokémon? Am I not needed much? Would I have been better off if I remained in the wild? No, I should give this Trainer a little more of a chance... 
Humans can’t understand the cries of Pokémon, nor our feelings. However, there are some among us that understand human speech... Hehehe, [VAR(259, 1)], you’re not bad for a human. 
If a Pokémon were to travel along, it would be limited as to where it could go. But traveling with a human, a Pokémon would be able to travel farther afield to more distant cities and lands. Traveling with [VAR(259, 1)] has been rewarding and reassuring. And very entertaining... 
Some wild Pokémon frown upon others for traveling with humans. They jeer that the caught Pokémon have “forgotten the wild.” But that view is mistaken. They have just never met a Trainer who could be a great partner. A great partner like [VAR(259, 1)], in other words... 
[VAR(259, 1)] is... A remarkable human and Trainer. That I can always perform the best any [VAR(256, 0)] possibly can... I attribute that entirely to my partner [VAR(259, 1)]. When we travel, I can see wild Pokémon eyeing us enviously... 
Does [VAR(259, 1)] intend to ignore me forever? Give me more opportunities for me to shine... 
If a Pokémon is treated as a friend, it will return the sentiments. We grow fonder of humans that treat us with kindness... Does [VAR(259, 1)] even like [VAR(257, 2)]? 
Did [VAR(257, 2)] get stronger? Who is responsible for making me so? Is it [VAR(259, 1)]’s doing? Is the Trainer owed my thanks? 
[VAR(259, 1)] and [VAR(257, 2)] are alike in some ways. In humanspeak, we match up well. Does [VAR(259, 1)] think so, too? 
[VAR(259, 1)] is very impressive, especially for a human. The Trainer lets [VAR(257, 2)] use every bit of power properly. It is a shame that [VAR(259, 1)] is only a human... 
That [VAR(259, 1)]... What is that Trainer thinking? Why make me join the team, then call upon me for nothing? Am I considered useless? Is the Trainer regretting having me? Does the Trainer dare disrespect this [VAR(256, 0)] so easily? 
I have little understanding of [VAR(259, 1)] as a human... [VAR(259, 1)] may not be too bad, considering that I, an oft-shunned [VAR(256, 0)], am one of the team... That said, I don’t intend to be all cheerful around [VAR(259, 1)]... 
Our kind prefers to lurk in dark and dank places... But being with [VAR(259, 1)], even bright and festive places seem less threatening... [VAR(259, 1)] has a strange charisma... 
Not for a moment did I think I would be traveling with a human... If my [VAR(256, 0)] friends were to see me now, they would be shocked. Or would they be envious of me...? 
That [VAR(259, 1)] is the most impressive of humans. It takes a lot to make me, [VAR(257, 2)], sunny and cheerful! As a show of affection, I should chomp down on the Trainer’s neck... Hahaha... Have no fear... I was merely joking... 
Wooooooh... [VAR(257, 2)] has nothing to do... Keep me too bored, and I’m liable to sneak up and bite... 
Is there any human that would grow to like us [VAR(256, 0)]? Well? Does [VAR(259, 1)] like [VAR(257, 2)]? [VAR(257, 2)] doesn’t like... Well, no, maybe not... 
[VAR(259, 1)] treats me, [VAR(257, 2)], nicely without being scared. But [VAR(257, 2)] will be even scarier from now on. That’s what we [VAR(256, 0)] do... 
[VAR(257, 2)] is starting to forget a little about being in the wild... But [VAR(257, 2)] isn’t feeling sad. It’s never boring with [VAR(259, 1)]... 
There are no Pokémon that dislike humans... Only humans that dislike Pokémon... We [VAR(256, 0)] are especially shunned... But [VAR(259, 1)] always treats me as a friend and partner... 
Hnurrrr... Hunh? This is... Where? [VAR(259, 1)]’s house, is this? It’s not? Hnurrr... If you don’t need me for anything, can I go back to my Ball? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm... I like to sleep most the time. Oh, I like to eat, too. That’s next. But what I really like is to think. I’m a very deep thinker. When I think about the future of the [VAR(256, 0)] species... ...Hnurrr...hunh? Oh, I forget where the time goes. Hnurrrr... 
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm... There are lots of kinds of moves. I like those Dark-type moves, oh, and Dragon-type moves, too... How would they be for this [VAR(256, 0)]? Will they be for me? Or a no, no, no sort of thing? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... I don’t know how to begin saying this... I liked living quietly before I met [VAR(259, 1)]. Sssh. But I’m getting to like traveling with [VAR(259, 1)]. I think I’m getting sort of funky. Do you think I’m sort of funky? No? No funk for me? Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm... Other Pokémon, they say to me... “You’re not thinking, are you?” How insulting they should say so. It isn’t true what they say. Think, think, think, I do that. All the time, I think hard how to help [VAR(259, 1)]. I concentrate! Hnurrr... 
Hnurrr... I did not know that? I really don’t? What is this? I don’t know what to say? Hnurrr...

A brief occasion of joy is imminent... But remember this: the good and the bad are on opposite sides of a coin...
An unseeable accident lurks... Whether you succumb to it or rise above, it all depends on you...
Destiny shall shift... Whether that bodes well or ill is beyond the spectrum of my sight...
Many are the eyes that I have gazed into over the years, be they human or Pokémon... But your eyes swirl with compassion, strength, joy, sorrow, and more... The ever-shifting colors in your eyes make you difficult to read...
Me, I’m just a simple soul. I let my guitar do all my talking. All I need is music and Pokémon. I can shine wherever I go if I have those things in my life.

Pokémon from around the country can be brought here. In other words, Pokémon from places like Kanto and Hoenn. This place also happens to be where you compete to see how quickly you can catch those Pokémon! 
It’s good to see you’ve come to join us for a visit. Let me make a gift of this Trainer Counter for your Pokétch. 
Oak: I plan to be in Eterna City for some time. Being here, I should make the best of my time studying the Pokémon of the Sinnoh region. 
Pal Park is so scintillating! Trainers and Pokémon are so full of intent here! 
I’ve never seen some Pokémon. Would you show me if you had one?

Welcome to Pal Park! This is where top-notch Trainers come to demonstrate their Pokémon-catching techniques to their peers. ...Oh? Are you maybe... Ah, you are [VAR(259, 0)]! We’ve all heard rumors about you! Word is, you’re a hotshot Trainer?! We’d be honored if you would participate in our Catching Shows.
Yes! You agreed to participate! It’s a happy day for me! Let’s not waste any time! Let me explain how Pal Park works. I wrote the Pal Park manual for situations just like this. What should I explain?
Pal Park is a place where you are timed on the catching of six Pokémon. You are provided with six special Poké Balls for the challenge. Participating Trainers are required to supply the six Pokémon that are to be caught. If you do not supply the stock of six Pokémon, you may not participate in the Catching Show. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
At the start of the Catching Show, you will be given six Park Balls. Use the Park Balls to catch the six Pokémon you provide. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
You may make Pokémon migrate from Kanto or Hoenn to stock your Catching Game. Insert a Game Boy Advance Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen in the Game Pak Slot. When your DS is turned on, currently caught Pokémon can migrate from the Game Pak to the DS Game Card. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
Pokémon caught in Sinnoh may also be used to stock your Catching Game. Please ask the guy next to me who’s in charge of stocking Pokémon. ...Do you want me to explain anything else?
Would you like to take part in a Catching Show now?
Aww, that’s too bad. Well, just give me a shout if you’d like to participate.
Hi there, [VAR(259, 0)]! Did you come to participate in a Catching Show?

Oh, hold on. You don’t have enough Pokémon for a Catching Show. You’ll need to stock us with six Pokémon to participate. You should make some Pokémon migrate from Kanto or Hoenn!
Very well, let me explain how things work around here. I’ll read to you from the Pal Park manual I wrote.
I’m sorry you had to retire. We hope you try harder next time. I’ll take what Park Balls you have left. Next time, please do stay to catch all six Pokémon.
Oh, your PC Boxes are filled. You have no room for six more Pokémon. You won’t be able to accept them, even if you do catch them. Make enough room in a PC Box and come back for your Catching Show.
Congratulations! That’s all six Pokémon caught! The audience sure enjoyed watching your Catching Show. All right, let’s see your all-important score from this show! ... ... Catching Points: [VAR(309, 0)]! Time Points: [VAR(309, 1)]! Type Points: [VAR(309, 2)]! The total is... ... ... [VAR(309, 3)] points! 
Wow! That’s an outstanding record! Kudos to you! 
Good! That’s a decent record. Props to you! 
Would you like to put all the Pokémon you’ve caught in PC Boxes?
Done! Your Pokémon have been boxed away. You’ll now have to save the game. 
Oh, then it might be fun for you to go for an even better score by trying to catch these six again. If you want to do another Catching Show, just come see us!
If you want to do another Catching Show, come see us again!
It’s time for your prize! Here you are! 
Would you like to do another Catching Show with the same Pokémon?

[VAR(259, 0)], my daughter is a big fan of yours. A day doesn’t go by without her demanding we come see Catching Shows.
People come here not only to see the Catching Show. We get to see rare and exotic Pokémon on top of the catches. The excitement gets me all jacked up!
The current record holder is [VAR(259, 1)] with [VAR(309, 2)] points. Can you top that?
Oh! You’ve topped 2,000 points! You’ve earned this, then! 
Keep working on getting a higher score!
Oh! You’ve topped 2,500 points! You’ve earned this, then! 
Oh! You’ve topped 3,000 points! You’ve earned this, then!

The only items you ever throw are Poké Balls! But is that true?! I want people to think about that. That’s why I give away the Technical Machine Fling. 
Using that move, the Pokémon hurls whatever item it’s holding at the foe. The move’s effect depends on what item is hurled. Remember, the move Fling fails if the Pokémon isn’t holding anything.
When I first started fishing, catching anything made me happy. But those days are long gone now... Now I get annoyed if I can’t beat my record by even an inch...
I can’t explain it. I get more easily agitated at night.

There are many old books here... “The Secrets of Psychics” “The Hidden Powers of Pokémon” “What is Psychic Energy?”...

Were you looking for me? Did you miss me? I wish I had a new nugget of wisdom to share with you, but alas, I don’t! So, I’ll have to make it up to you with this! 
That’s my Nugget! Try to spend it wisely! A Nugget of gold has to be worth more than a nugget of my wisdom!

I’m the Day-Care Man. We look after the precious Pokémon of other Trainers. If you’d like us to raise your Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it’s you! We were raising your Pokémon, and my goodness, were we surprised! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! We don’t know how it got there, but your Pokémon had it. You do want it, don’t you?
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you. Your [VAR(256, 0)]’s doing just fine.
Well then, I’ll hang on to it. Thanks!
You have no room for it right now... Come back when you’ve made room.
[VAR(259, 0)] received the Egg from the Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
By the way, I saw your [VAR(256, 0)] cavorting with [VAR(259, 1)]’s [VAR(256, 2)]. I may even have seen it receiving a piece of Mail.
If you want to pick up your Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you! Your [VAR(256, 0)] and [VAR(256, 1)] are doing just fine. 
I really will keep it. You do want this, yes?
The two seem to get along very well.
The two seem to get along.
The two don’t seem to like each other much.
The two prefer to play with other Pokémon more than with each other.
I’m the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. Would you like us to raise your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon should we raise for you? 
Fine, we’ll raise your [VAR(256, 0)] for a while. Come back for it later. 
We can raise two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise another?
Ah, there you are! My husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then. Come again.
You don’t have enough money...
Do you want to take back the other one, too?
Very good. Come again.
Ah, it’s you! Good to see you. Now, about your Pokémon... 
By level, your [VAR(256, 0)] has grown by about [VAR(307, 1)]. 
Your Pokémon team is full. Make room, then come see me.
Which Pokémon will you take back?
If you want your [VAR(256, 0)] back, it will cost $[VAR(309, 1)].
Excellent! Here’s your Pokémon. 
[VAR(259, 1)] took [VAR(256, 0)] back from the Day-Care Lady. 
Oh? But you only have one Pokémon with you. You can’t go off without a Pokémon. Come back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back?
If you leave me that Pokémon, what are you gonna battle with? Come back another time.
Huh? Now, now. If you leave that Pokémon with me, you’ll be left with just one. You will be better off if you catch some more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now. That is merely an Egg!
Fine, we’ll raise your [VAR(256, 0)] for a while. Come back for it later.
Huh?

Dawn: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)]? The professor told me something. He thinks [VAR(256, 1)] may have reappeared at the Spear Pillar...
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0)]! You’re friends with the elder of Celestic Town, aren’t you? She told me that she had something she wanted to show you.
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0)]! May I see your Pokédex? ... Oh, my gosh! You’ve seen every kind of Pokémon in Sinnoh! Have you shown your Pokédex to Prof. Rowan yet?
Dawn: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)], have you ever chatted with my kid sister?
Dawn: Oh, [VAR(259, 0)], are you acquainted with Bebe? She lives in Hearthome City. Every Trainer should make it a point to pay Bebe a visit.
Dawn: Hey! [VAR(259, 0)], you’ve got a Poké Radar? Watch for tall grass to rustle wildly when you use your Poké Radar. That could be a sign that a rare Pokémon is hiding in there.
Dawn: Hi, [VAR(259, 0)]! How’s your Poké Radar? When you use it, do you sometimes see more than one patch of tall grass rustling? The patch farther away gives you a better chance of seeing the same kind of Pokémon in a row. That’s the feeling I get, anyways.
Dawn: Sometimes a patch of grass sparkles when a Poké Radar is used. People say a different-colored Pokémon is hiding there! Could that be true?
Dawn: So, [VAR(259, 0)]. I’m also helping the professor put together the National Pokédex. Catching Pokémon can be really challenging, can’t it? But, it’s also so much fun!
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0)]! [VAR(259, 0)], [VAR(259, 0)], [VAR(259, 0)]! Congratulations for completing the National Pokédex!
Dawn: Is today maybe... Your birthday, [VAR(259, 0)]?
Dawn: Giggle... Congratulations, [VAR(259, 0)]! And many more happy returns!
Dawn: Oh, it isn’t? I wonder what made me think that today was your birthday?
Dawn: [VAR(259, 0)]! I heard from the professor! Congratulations, Champ!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)]! The prof told me something cool. He thinks [VAR(256, 1)] has reappeared at the Spear Pillar!
Lucas: Hi, [VAR(259, 0)]! You know the elder of Celestic Town, right? She told me she wanted to show you something.
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)]! Let me take a look at your Pokédex. ... Awesome! You’ve seen every kind of Pokémon in Sinnoh! Have you shown this Pokédex to Prof. Rowan yet?
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)], have you ever seen my kid sister?
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)], have you met Bebe? She lives out in Hearthome City. If you’re a Trainer, you owe it to yourself to visit her.
Lucas: Hey! [VAR(259, 0)], you’ve got yourself a Poké Radar, too? Watch for tall grass to rustle wildly when you use that Poké Radar. That’s a sign that rare Pokémon may be hiding there.
Lucas: Hi, [VAR(259, 0)]! How’s your Poké Radar working out? When you use it, do you sometimes see more than one patch of tall grass rustling? The patch farther away gives you a better chance of seeing the same kind of Pokémon right in a row. I think that’s how it goes.
Lucas: Sometimes a patch of grass sparkles when a Poké Radar is used. They say a different-colored Pokémon is hiding there! I wonder if that’s true?
Lucas: So, [VAR(259, 0)]. I’m also helping the professor out with the National Pokédex. Catching Pokémon can be really challenging, can’t it? But I also have a ton of fun doing it!
Lucas: [VAR(259, 0)]! Wow! I don’t know what to say! I mean, it’s so awesome and all... Sincerely, congratulations for completing the National Pokédex!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR(259, 0)]? Is it maybe your birthday today?
Lucas: I thought so! Congratulations, [VAR(259, 0)]! You know, I’m glad we’re friends!
Lucas: Huh? It isn’t? Now, what made me think it was your birthday? Freaky weird.
Lucas: [VAR(259, 0)]! The professor told me the news! Congratulations, Champ!

[VAR(259, 0)]? He went tearing off in a huge rush a while ago.
Everyone goes off on adventures, and then they gradually grow up...
It’s true that wild Pokémon do attack people sometimes... However, Pokémon also let you become friends with them.
Oh! A Pokémon! You look good together!
Oh, you’re helping put together a Pokédex? That means you’re going to travel all over the region with Pokémon! That sounds like a lot of fun! I’m a little envious, to be honest!

Mom: You know how impatient [VAR(259, 0)] is. He took off before I could even ask what it was about.
Mom: Bye-bye, [VAR(259, 0)]! You take care now!
Mom: But that [VAR(259, 0)]... He always invites you along.
Mom: Oh, yes! [VAR(259, 0)]! Don’t go into the tall grass. Wild Pokémon might attack you. It would be OK if you had your own Pokémon, but you don’t, so...
Mom: What is it, dear? Isn’t [VAR(259, 0)] waiting for you?
Mom: What’s up, dear? ... Wow. I can’t believe that happened to you. Am I ever glad that both you and [VAR(259, 0)] are unharmed. The professor you mentioned is most likely Professor Rowan of Sandgem Town. I’ve heard that he is well known for his studies on Pokémon. I hear he’s also quite intimidating... [VAR(259, 1)], I think you need to visit him in Sandgem Town. You need to properly explain why you had no choice but to use his Pokémon. Don’t worry! I’m sure he will understand. 
Oh, I know! [VAR(259, 0)], put these on. 
[VAR(259, 0)] received a pair of [VAR(65280, 1)]Running Shoes[VAR(65280, 0)]!
Going to Sandgem Town is like an adventure in itself, right? With those Running Shoes, you can get to faraway places much faster. OK... Let me read the instructions... “Press the B Button and dash about faster than ever before! “Put on the Running Shoes and blaze new trails of adventure!” Well, isn’t that just nifty!
Mom: I’ll read you the instructions for the Running Shoes... “Press the B Button and dash about faster than ever before! “Put on the Running Shoes and blaze new trails of adventure!” Well, isn’t that just nifty!
Mom: Welcome home, [VAR(259, 0)]. Are you and your Pokémon healthy? It’s still early in the morning. Take a quick rest, dear. 
Mom: Welcome home, [VAR(259, 0)]. Are you and your Pokémon healthy? Take a quick rest, dear. 
Mom: Welcome home, [VAR(259, 0)]. Are you and your Pokémon healthy? I just made dinner. Take a quick rest, dear. 
Mom: Welcome home, [VAR(259, 0)]. Are you and your Pokémon healthy? It’s so late right now... Take a quick rest, dear. 
Mom: What’s up, [VAR(259, 0)]? ... Wow. Professor Rowan asked you to do something that big. OK, dear, go for it! Your mom’s got your back! Oh, I know! [VAR(259, 0)], I’ve got something that you’ll find useful. 
That’s a Journal. It keeps a record of your daily events. Check it, and you’ll be able to remember what you did last. 
Gee, a journey full of adventure... I envy you, kiddo. Plus, you’re not alone. You have your Pokémon with you. I wish I could go instead! 
I’m just joking, dear! Yup, [VAR(259, 0)]! I’ll be all right by myself, so you go and enjoy your adventure! When you’re exposed to new things, and experience new sensations... It makes your mother happy too. ...But come back sometimes. I would like to see the kinds of Pokémon you’ve caught, dear. 
[VAR(259, 1)]’s mom: Excuse me. Is my little [VAR(259, 1)] here? 
Mom: Oh? No, he’s not... 
[VAR(259, 1)]’s mom: Oh... Then, he must have left already... What to do... That boy shouted about going on an adventure, then he bolted. He’s so headstrong and reckless... I at least wanted him to take this... 
Mom: Not to worry, [VAR(259, 0)] will deliver that to him. 
Won’t you, [VAR(259, 0)]? 
[VAR(259, 1)]’s mom: Oh, really? You’d do that for me? [VAR(259, 0)], please take this to [VAR(259, 1)] for me. 
[VAR(259, 1)]’s mom: Oh, really? You’d do that for me? [VAR(259, 0)], please take this to [VAR(259, 1)] for me.

... Hmm... I see... This Pokémon seems to be rather happy. 
Well well! You’ve made your Pokémon evolve already?! 
All righty then! I’ll give that [VAR(256, 0)] to you as a gift. 
Professor: Now that it’s yours, would you like to give it a nickname?
Professor: Hmm, OK, I see... And you’re happy with that nickname?
Professor: Your friend [VAR(259, 1)] told me what happened at the lake. I heard you battled very well, despite it being your first time. And, from what I can see, there is a growing bond between you and that Pokémon, though it is still young. That’s why I would like to entrust you with [VAR(256, 0)]. 
Dawn: I’m so glad that you’re kind toward Pokémon! If you weren’t, I’d have to... Oh, I just can’t say it... 
Lucas: Boy, am I glad you’re kind toward Pokémon. If you weren’t, well... I don’t even want to think about it. 
Professor: Er-hem! Let’s move on to the main topic. There is something I want you to do for me. 
My name is Rowan. I study Pokémon. First of all, I want to know exactly what kinds of Pokémon live in the Sinnoh region. To do so, it is necessary to collect data using the Pokédex. This is what I wish to ask of you. I want to entrust you with this Pokédex. Will you use it to record data on all the Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: ... ... ... ... I can stand here without speaking for hours. I’m a very patient man. Let me ask you again, [VAR(259, 0)]. I want to entrust you with this Pokédex. Will you use it to record data on all the Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: Hm! Good answer! 
[VAR(259, 0)] obtained the [VAR(65280, 1)]Pokédex[VAR(65280, 0)]!
Rowan: That Pokédex is a very high-tech device. It will automatically record data on every kind of Pokémon you encounter. [VAR(259, 0)], I ask that you go everywhere and meet every kind of Pokémon in this region! 
Dawn: I’ve got one, too! 
Lucas: I’ve got the same kind of Pokédex as you. 
Rowan: When you walked up Route 201 with your Pokémon, what did you feel? I’ve lived for 60 long years. Even now, I get a thrill when I’m with a Pokémon. Now, you should know that there are countless Pokémon in this world. That means there are just as many thrills waiting for you out there! Now go! [VAR(259, 0)], your grand adventure begins right now! 
Rowan: Go on! [VAR(259, 0)], your grand adventure awaits you!
Dawn: The Pokémon that I used for the first time was [VAR(256, 1)]! If you would have chosen [VAR(256, 1)] at the lake, we’d have the same Pokémon now! Not that it matters, but... Anyways, I’m Dawn. I also help the professor add pages to the Pokédex. So, in a sense, I’m just like you. I just got a little head start on you, that’s all. I’ll be happy to teach you things. Glad to meet you, [VAR(259, 0)]! 
Lucas: The professor asked me to help, so I’m going to go out and fill the Pokédex pages, too. That makes us comrades working toward the same goal. I’ll teach you stuff later, OK? 
I’m [VAR(259, 0)]’s father. I’ll be happy to assist you on your quest for the professor. Hahaha. Eh... I’m sure we can count on you!
Professor Rowan invented a new Pokédex while working alongside a professor from the Kanto region!

Hmm... So, you’ve seen [VAR(308, 0)] Pokémon. 
What’s wrong? You’re not going to tell me you’ve seen too few to bother showing me?
Bravo, [VAR(259, 0)]! You’ve recorded all the Pokémon of Sinnoh in your Pokédex! This will help immeasurably with my studies on Pokémon evolution... 
Rowan: Hm! [VAR(259, 0)], I’ve been waiting to see you! You’ve met every kind of Pokémon there is in the Sinnoh region! This will help immensely with my studies on Pokémon evolution... 
Oak: Greetings, Professor Rowan! It’s been a very long time! I’ll tell you, Sinnoh certainly is a long trip from Kanto. Of course, if it means meeting new Pokémon, there’s no distance too great for the likes of us to travel. 
Rowan: Oh! If it isn’t my old colleague, Professor Oak! I should have expected as much from the world’s authority on Pokémon! We always used to joke, “Where there are Pokémon, you’ll find Oak!” It’s good to see that hasn’t changed one bit! 
Professor Oak, let me introduce you to my young assistant. This youngster has filled every page of the Sinnoh Pokédex for me. 
Oak: Ah, well, very glad to meet you! As you’ve heard, my name is Oak. I’ve been hearing a great deal about you from Professor Rowan lately. He’s been exuberant in praise about a fantastic young Trainer. I see that you live up to--no--that you’ve surpassed his praise. You’ve also got an impeccable sense of timing. You see, I had an errand to run for Professor Rowan on my visit here. He’d asked me to bring the data for the National Pokédex, you see. So, since you’re here, let me upgrade your Pokédex with the National Mode. After all, there are many kinds of Pokémon in this world of ours! 
[VAR(259, 0)]’s Pokédex was upgraded with the National Mode! 
Oak: I’m afraid it won’t be easy to complete the National Pokédex. However, I’m sure you will make an honest attempt on our behalf! 
Rowan: Have no fear, [VAR(259, 0)] will get the job done. By the way, Professor Oak, what compelled you to visit this region? 
Oak: Ah, yes. I’ve heard that the Pal Park is now open. If I remember correctly, it’s at the end of Route 221. The Pal Park has a special system that attracts every imaginable kind of Pokémon from every region. I’ve come to make certain that system is operating properly. 
[VAR(259, 0)], you should make an effort to visit the Pal Park, too. Oops! I’ll be late for my meeting if I don’t get going! OK, it was a pleasure seeing the both of you! Bye, now! 
[VAR(259, 0)], you should make an effort to visit the Pal Park, too. Oops! I’ll be late for my meeting if I don’t get going! OK, it was a pleasure seeing the both of you! Bye, now! 
Rowan: Off he goes, as busy as ever... 
Now, [VAR(259, 0)]... I have a gift here as your reward for completing the Sinnoh Pokédex. 
Rowan: That’s the Pokémon Radar, or just Poké Radar for short. Use it, and it will indicate grass patches where Pokémon are lurking. I’d prepared that to help my field assistants put together the Sinnoh Pokédex, but you took care of that! I’m sure it will be useful for your goal of filling the National Pokédex.
Rowan: The world is immense. There are many more Pokémon. That means there are many more thrills for you to seek and enjoy!

The Sinnoh region’s newspaper is tiny, but it has many fans. That newspaper is printed right here!
“Weekly Poké Ball Roundup” is the featured top story. It’s a feature article on new types of Poké Balls. 
Which article would you like to read?
Dark caves and streets unlit at night are forbidding places to go. If you’re threatened by the dark, a supply of Dusk Balls is your biggest ally! Use them in the dark for the best Pokémon-catching performance! Keep the dark at bay on your travels with Dusk Balls!
Catching Pokémon is best accomplished by whittling the target’s HP down as low as possible, then tossing a Ball. But a Pokémon caught that way can’t be used in battle right away. That’s where the Heal Ball comes in handy. You can lower the target’s HP bar to red, put it to sleep, or paralyze it. The Heal Ball instantly heals whatever ails the Pokémon it catches! That’s the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball! Please, do give it a try!
When attempting to catch a Pokémon, you want to cut the target’s HP. But a fleet-footed Pokémon could bolt if you take too much time. The Quick Ball is the solution to that dilemma. It’s designed to work best when thrown right at the start of battle! The Quick Ball: the perfect gift for the impatient Trainer!

I wanted to give you some Seals, but you don’t have a Seal Case! You should talk to my mom!
The [VAR(266, 0)] were put away in the Seal Case.
You can customize Poké Balls by affixing Seals on them. Oh, you don’t have a Seal Case? Well, here you go! 
First, check the heading “Ball Capsules” in your PC menu. Next, choose a Capsule and apply Seals to it as you wish. When you’re done, put the Capsule on a Poké Ball.
My son goes out to the ruins whenever he gets the chance. He says that it’s good for making Seals for his Ball Capsules. If you don’t mind, can you show him the Pokémon you catch in the ruins?

There’s an odd spaceman in front of the ruins. There isn’t anything there, but that only seemed to make him get angry. He’s saying he will blow the town up with a bomb... The nerve of it all... If only I were younger, I’d punish that spaceman with my Pokémon...
This town is insignificant! There’s nothing of value here. It doesn’t need to exist, so I’ll blow it up with a Galactic Bomb! If you try to mess with me, I’ll shut you down with a Pokémon battle. So, what’s it going to be? Are you going to mess with me?
You dare to oppose Team Galactic? That means you’re taking on the world... No, the universe, even! 
That’s right! Very smart! You know what’s good for you! Team Galactic has come out to the boonies like this for everyone’s sake. Your cooperation is appreciated. Now, where is my partner...?
Too much to handle... I can’t do anything here... This place is nothing! I’ll be happily rid of this place! 
Oh, you were magnificent! Aren’t you quite the Trainer? As the elder of Celestic Town, I give you my thanks. Oh? That Old Charm... May I see that, dear? ... What’s that? You say Cynthia entrusted you with it to deliver to me? That Cynthia... She’s my granddaughter. 
[VAR(259, 0)] handed over the [VAR(264, 1)] to the elder.
This Old Charm is something made in Celestic Town long, long ago. It was made in honor of a mythical deity said to have created Sinnoh. These Old Charms are still discovered now and again. Since you’re in Celestic Town, why not look around inside the ruins?
You’ve gone to the trouble of visiting Celestic Town. Why not take a little more time to examine the ruins?
There appears to have been an insignificant struggle here. Everyone should step back and view things from a bigger perspective. Yes, a bigger perspective, one that is on a universal scale. 
My name is Cyrus. I seek the power to create a new world, a world without strife. However, that power seems to be unavailable here... We’ve met before, yes? It was at Mt. Coronet. If you discover any power derived from the legends of Sinnoh, inform me. For that power is what I need to create my new world. 
Howdy! Studying up on local history?
Hey, do you know what they say? They say a Pokémon created the Sinnoh region.
There’s no Pokémon Mart in this town... Instead, you can buy and sell items in this house here.
Celestic Town The Past Lives
A giant etching of a Pokémon-like creature covers the wall... There is some fading text etched in as well... The flow of time never stops... The past, future, and present...

What would bring you to a place so far off the beaten path? There is nothing to see but some ancient Pokémon etchings...
They say this town has been here since Sinnoh was made.
Oh, now, this is interesting. Let’s see your Pokémon. 
It clearly likes you very much. You can have this! 
It’s about trust between the Trainer and the Pokémon. Developing trust in each other is the key to victory.
It’s warming up to you in  a very nice way. It will grow even more friendly if you travel with it some more.
It’s not very used to you yet. You both need to develop trust for one another as Trainer and Pokémon.

Where are you from? ... Hm, Twinleaf Town, you say. Isn’t that close to Lake Verity? That lake is said to be home to MESPRIT, the being of emotion. It must be looking over you.
Hm? If you get the Gym Badge from Hearthome, you can use Surf anytime. Using Surf, you’ll be able to go to places that were once out of reach. You may be in for some surprises as to where you can go using Surf.
Celestic Town is the oldest town in all of Sinnoh. The town was founded to honor Pokémon from the distant past. Or at least that’s the legend...
Well, hello! You look good. I did some research of my own since that spot of trouble last time. Mt. Coronet acting up had me very concerned, too. Well, this is what I found in the shrine. It’s a book, and it’s quite old. See for yourself. 
“PALKIA, the Pokémon that binds the spatial dimensions,” it is written... 
“DIALGA, the guardian Pokémon of time,” it is written... 
It seems that there were two Pokémon in ancient Sinnoh. They respectively stood as symbols of time and spatial dimensions...
My big sister is studying the myths of Sinnoh. She wants to know how people and Pokémon interacted in the days of myths. Were things different back then? Or were they the same as now? She says that’s the focus of her research.
It’s hard to tell for sure, but it’s probably an invaluable scroll.
It’s an old book. [VAR(259, 0)] began reading it. “When that Pokémon was born, intelligence bloomed among us, enriching our lives. “When that Pokémon was born, emotions bloomed among us, giving us joy and sorrow. “When that Pokémon was born, willpower bloomed among us, spurring us into action...”

Putting on a pair of glasses changes how the world looks. Taking off a pair of glasses changes how the world looks, too. Deep, man. 
So, would you like to change how the world looks to your Pokémon? 
Morning is the start of a new day. Put on the Choice Specs and make the right choices. 
The sunlight is bright in the day. How about a pair of BlackGlasses? 
At night, reflect on what you’ve learned with the Wise Glasses. 
Choice Specs make the Pokémon use only one kind of move. But they also raise the Pokémon’s Special Attack stat.
BlackGlasses raise the power of Dark-type moves.
The Wise Glasses boost the power of special moves.

[VAR(259, 0)] examined the ancient cave painting. Mysterious designs cover a whole section of the wall. There are three strange things forming a triangle. In the middle of them, a shining sphere? What is this all about? 
The cave painting’s meaning seems to be this... There existed a being... A being so powerful, it was considered a deity at the time. Opposing this powerful being were three Pokémon. The three kept balance with the being, as if they formed a triangle. It’s an ancient legend of Sinnoh that is still told in Celestic Town. 
Oh, yes. I found something useful. You should take this. It belonged to my granddaughter, but she doesn’t use it anymore. 
If a Pokémon learns Surf, it can carry you across water and the sea. But my granddaughter said something about this hidden move... Oh, yes! To use Surf outside of battle, the Hearthome Gym Badge must first be obtained. On that matter, you will have to handle it yourself, I’m afraid.

Anyways, if we see each other on Stark Mountain, the race is on to see who gets the Magma Stone first! 
Hey, traveling Trainer. Is your Bag full of items? Or is it full of dreams?
Trainers who lose at the Battle Tower come here to train.
I’ve been exploring a long time, but I know when I’m beaten. It takes a better Trainer than me to explore the volcano thoroughly!
I’m a Cameraman, obviously. Have you seen that TV program, “Search for the Red GYARADOS!”? You know, “The mysterious appearance of a raging Pokémon in a lake”? Yeah, that outstanding documentary! I filmed that!
Oh man! Oh geez! Oh, this is bad! But I’m a Cameraman, obviously! I have to stand firm and get this on film for the world to see!
I’m a Cameraman, obviously. “The Eruption of Stark Mountain? The mystery of the fiery Pokémon asleep deep in the volcano!” I’ve had that documentary all mapped out in my head for a long time...

I wasn’t experienced enough for the Battle Tower... Training on Stark Mountain seems to be the only sensible choice ... For some reason, the best Trainers in Sinnoh seem to gather there.
In a Multi Battle, coordination with your partner is vital. By working together, one plus one could become not just two, but even three or four. But one times one is always one. Do you understand that?

Let me tell you about the volcano named Stark Mountain. That volcano dates to when Sinnoh was made by the melding of time and space. Fiery lava spilled out and pooled, and then it turned into a Pokémon. It’s said the Magma Stone was used to keep the Pokémon under control. Over time, the Pokémon turned into the volcano, according to legend.
You say the Magma Stone was found? The legend was true, then? If so, the volcano’s Pokémon may awaken and cause an eruption!
HEATRAN... So there was such a Pokémon? Did it come to be when Sinnoh was created?
Buck: Gotcha, gramps! I’ll put the Magma Stone back. That Magma Stone was keeping the volcano Pokémon under control. It’s all right, though. I can go put it back myself.

I’ll never stop wearing shorts. Not for anybody! 
I make it a policy to wear miniskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate! 
What’s your policy? 
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing! 
Miniskirts make legs look longer! Is that a good thing? 
I’m on the lookout for adorable accessories.

I want to test out something I learned at private school.
Yes! It worked perfectly!

Hmm. You’re no big deal. Hmm? 
Hmm. So, you are good. Hmm. 
Oh, yes. I shall attack now.
I’ve done it! 
Oh, how disappointing. 
Over it is, your adventure. Come hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was. 
Oh, how vexing this so is. Verily, I thank you. 
How boring...
So truly boring... 
That was a good way to waste some time. 
Hunh? Where is everyone?
Hey, guys! Where are you?! 
I came to camp, but I think I got separated from my friends... 
Oh! You have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my Pokétch, but I still won! 
I was fooling around with my Pokétch, and I lost... 
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It’s the power of the forests. 
I’m going back to the forest. 
I’ll battle you like I’m on a picnic!
Lalala! 
Pretending this is a picnic won’t let me win. 
Ooh-la-la! Here we come!
Ooh-la-la! So happy I won! 
Ooh-la-la! Even losing can’t dampen my spirits! 
I’ll teach you what’s fun about battling.
Battling me was fun, wasn’t it? 
Oh, my, that was inspiring! You’re the greatest! 
I... I can swim, really! I don’t need my inner tube!
It... It’s true! 
I... I’m not lying! 
I like rivers more than the sea. Which do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels just super. 
I don’t like the sea because the salty water burns my eyes! 
Go, go, go! Go, my Pokémon!
That’s the way! Way to go, my Pokémon! 
Good effort! Way to go, my Pokémon! 
The beach sand is so hot! It makes me go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea! 
Ouch, ouch, ouch! 
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash! Ker-splash! 
Flip, flop! 
I’m a girl in love with her inner tube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I’m a girl in love with her inner tube! 
Good-bye! I’m a girl in love with her inner tube! 
Oh, yeah! I’m feeling it! I’m tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah! 
Tch! Losing threw off my rhythm! 
Rock? Jazz? Techno? Anything’ll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal! 
So, yeah... You’ve got me in the mood for singing the blues... 
Let’s get this session on!
You’re obviously short on practice. 
My dream of a world tour... It seems so far away... 
Oh, hello... Well, isn’t that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf? 
Oh, you! You’re not just fashionable, you’re good with Pokémon! How unfair! 
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh? You’re not my fan? 
What a horrible way to treat an idol... 
La, lala, lah.
La lalala. Lalalah lah. 
Bye-bye, lalah! 
Let’s see who loves Pokémon more, you or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for Pokémon trumped yours! 
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is stronger than mine? 
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind of tough.
You don’t want to underestimate me. 
You’re some kind of mighty. 
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon. Don’t be shy now, come on.
I see... Cute, but on the weak side. 
I see! Cute, and yet tough. 
My Pokémon are cute, but they’re not very tough!
Oh? We won? Seriously? 
It’s OK. I like my Pokémon. That’s all that matters. 
I’ve been pampering my gang too much lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it! I knew I could count on my gang! 
Pampering Pokémon too much is no good... 
Won’t you join our Pokémon Fan Club?
There’s all sorts of fun things to do if you join! 
Join us! Become a Pokéfan like me! 
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice. One loss served fresh. 
Ah, an excellent choice. A win served fresh. 
What I really hoped to become was a cook.
I don’t mind this job now, mind you. 
I just find it hard talking to strangers. 
For battles and order taking, speed is essential!
Like, chop-chop! You got served. 
Food is like battling. Serve it while it’s hot! 
My job is about serving others. But don’t expect me to serve here.
Mufufu. 
Why couldn’t you serve me? You won’t make friends that way! 
Isn’t this cute? My uniform.
It’s my favorite! 
You messed up my uniform! 
You’re good, aren’t you?
Oops. I’m a little disappointed. 
I knew you were a tough Trainer. 
I catch and raise all sorts of Pokémon.
See? I’ve raised them pretty good. 
I need to raise my Pokémon some more! 
I’ll snag you with my net!
It’s in the bag! 
Hey! Don’t run away! 
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS. Like, king size! 
If only I had a giant HERACROSS... 
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine! 
I lie shattered... 
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah! You saw it! 
You didn’t fall for my fake ninja boasting! 
I shall become a real ninja when I grow up!
Excellent! Excellent! 
So, what’s a real ninja supposed to do? 
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay! 
No! No tormenting me! 
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn’t it cute? 
My mommy is really good at sewing. 
Let’s do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone! 
Waaaaah! 
Sure, we’re going to battle, but don’t be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax. It’s best to be natural, dig? 
You have to loosen up some more. 
Fish, fish, fish, that’s what I do! I’m gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah! I am at the top of my game! 
Oh, waah! I let that get away! 
Exploring relics isn’t all fun and games!
Your skill level says you probably won’t make a good Ruin Maniac. 
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins! 
These mates of mine traveled the world with me!
What do you say? Pretty tough, right? 
Maybe it’s time we hit the road again... 
Hey, there! Check this out! My rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either. My Pokémon are tough, too! 
Aiyah! Hey! Wait! No! Stop! Don’t touch! 
Now just be patient. I’ll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren’t they awesome? They’re the most super of the uber! 
Awawawah... My... My Pokémon... 
Look! This is my favorite parasol! Oh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren’t they both cute? 
I’m only showing you! You can’t have any! 
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond a rainbow? 
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good things are in store. 
If you were the weather, what would you be now?
Right now, I’m feeling sunny without a cloud in the sky! 
I’m feeling fogbound... 
I really don’t like weak Trainers!
You don’t inspire much trust... 
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough and bursting with life! 
Lately, I’ve had a lot to worry about...
Winning makes all my worries seem trivial! 
You just added to my worries... 
This may hurt a little bit, but we’ll be done quick. Hold still!
There! Done! 
Ooh, no! That hurts! 
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle... I think I have a cold... 
Sniff... Sniffle... My nose is clogging up... 
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be? 
Do you have some cologne on? You smell sort of nice! 
You’re going to lose, but you’ll get to enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That’s what you get for swooning to my aroma! 
Kiiiih! I am so angry! 
Let my guitar howl! Hear me scream!
Yeahey! 
Giyaaaah! 
You should channel your feelings into songs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now? It’s rock! 
The way I feel now is kind of folksy. 
Now hear me! The Bird Keeper’s credo number one!
Soar high on a win! 
Rest your wings on a loss! 
Let’s both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could! 
Good going! 
Fly, fly, fly! We’re going to rule this battle!
Zoom! 
We’re gonna crash! 
I’m the Sailor among Sailors! I was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep! The sea was my mother! 
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on land, I get no-motion sickness... 
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them... I hear the sound of waves... 
I want to become a big man. Big like the sea big. 
Yahoo!
Come on! You holler too! 
Gweff! Hack! Hack! Hollering choked me up! 
You should aspire to the Hiker’s way of life!
You see? You love my lifestyle, don’t you? 
Now, come on now! You should look up to the way I live! 
My Pokémon and I are idols!
Say what you will! We’re idols! 
We have you beat when it comes down to popularity... 
Watch me! All eyes on me!
Ooh... This is what I live for... 
I became an idol because I wanted everyone to see me! 
I’m too into battling... They might fire me as an idol...
Battling is too much fun! 
I can’t help myself. No one can keep me from battling. 
I run a marathon every morning! It’s great!
My buff physique makes for easy wins! 
So I lost! I can still run great marathons! 
I’ll run on the spot while battling for the good of my health.
Let’s hear it for good health! 
Gasp! My ankle! I rolled my ankle! 
Out of the way! I’ve got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you somewhere, too? 
All the delivering I do every day... I’ve got deep muscle pain! 
It was me who put up the buildings around these parts.
So, what do you think? Cool stuff, huh? 
My dream is to make a building taller than a mountain! 
Smell that? That’s the smell of hay clinging to my body.
Whoa! 
This smell I have is the sweet scent of hay that Pokémon surely love. 
All right, take a run at me! My barrel chest can take it!
What? That’s all you’ve got? You can take a harder run at me! 
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It’s like you broke my barrel chest... 
I’m not getting any younger. I can’t overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for in experience. 
Oh, you’re good and young. There’s a sparkle about you. 
Hey! You there, Trainer! You and me, we’re battling!
Owned! 
Unbelievable! 
These here are my Pokémon. I raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren’t they? 
Well, I’ll be! We lost that one! 
I’m going to do my level best. You’d better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best! 
Yup! We tried hard, y’all! 
OK, everyone! Big smiles!
Big smiles! Come on! 
That’s a great smile! Your victory pose is picture perfect, too! 
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus! 
Zoom out, fade... 
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff... My camera’s toughened me up. 
Oof... I’m feeling groggy... 
Hello there, Trainer! Please battle with me!
Thanks for your help! 
I appreciate the lesson! 
I’ll do anything for a good news story!
I’m relentless about battling, too! 
Stop! Please, stop! You’ll break my mic! 
So, the question is, what is your opinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that what you’re thinking? 
I’m doing a live report on the topic of myself! 
Come on! We’ll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal! 
Wait! Don’t leave me behind! 
Gear change! We’re attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom! 
Kaboom! 
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at a full run?
Too slow! 
I’m taking it to a zone beyond speed! 
I’d rather cycle casually than go full speed.
Let’s take it easy. 
You ought to take things more casually... 
I only know how to go at full power, even against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win! 
Please! Let me call you Master Trainer from now on! 
My spirit burns, my fists are steel, and my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph! 
I sweated more. That makes me the victor! 
En garde!
I’m still ready for more. 
Urgh... I won’t forget this! 
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight! 
You’re not bad, you. 
The ultimate of my technique! Experience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest! Gwahahaha! 
I’ve fallen in defeat? Gw-gwaaah! 
Hi! Little kid! A battle, please!
Little kid! Thank you very kindly! 
Little kid! I’m really upset over this! 
I, um... I’ve never actually learned how to do karate.
You’re kidding?! I’m naturally talented?! 
A Black Belt is cool, huh? So I just dress up like one. 
It’s been five years since I took to the mountains. My hair’s grown wild!
I bathe every day! How dare you? 
Another five years...? 
Did I catch you smirking at my eight-pack abs?
You don’t appreciate the beauty of pure muscles! 
Musculature is the ultimate beauty! 
In love and in battles, I’ve never tasted defeat!
See? We won again! 
So, I lost. I don’t care! I have a date soon, so I don’t care! 
This is it! Over the top! Everyone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen! Victory is ours! 
Retreat! Sound the retreat! 
My career as a Trainer dates back 75 years. You think you can win?
Here’s a toast to my history! 
My history of glory... 
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was. 
I tip my hat to you. 
Oh, my... Such an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed? How adorable... 
I see... You’re more than simply adorable. 
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn’t you say? I find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp... Oh, dear... I’m worn out. 
Being rich doesn’t shield me from having worries...
Of course, being well off is much preferable to poverty, but... 
Lavish parties day after day... It gets rather tiresome, I must say. 
Come to know defeat... Learn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more powerful... 
The defeated merely slink away... 
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell! 
My power of suggestion failed to charm you! 
...
...Did it. 
I focused my mind in silence... 
My powers! There’s no trickery about them!
This is psychic power! 
There really is no trickery... 
Take it all!
Ahaha! 
Gah! 
Close your eyes and count... Slow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my victory! 
Tch... I thought I could lull you to sleep. 
I live among Pokémon.
I’ve never been much of a battler, but... 
I’m just not much of a battler. 
...They’re Pokémon I’ve raised with my father...
...Dad, are you seeing this? I did it... 
Dad, I can’t... I need to raise them some more... 
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of honest effort!
Yahaha! I’ve had a hands-on time raising those Pokémon! 
Urgwah! Look what you’ve done to my Pokémon! 
Will you have a look at the Pokémon I’ve raised?
Well? Cute, aren’t they? 
Cut a girl some slack! 
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right? 
Oh, but they’re so cute! 
Nice to meet you! Underestimate me at your peril!
Told you! 
I guess I underestimated you... 
Hmhm... I must say I like the look in your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat. Like jewels they are! 
Your eyes shine brighter than any big gemstone I keep at home! 
When I was your age, I was quite the daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild youth. 
I daresay, you’re quite the daredevil yourself! 
If you want to run home to mommy, here’s you chance, punk!
Geheheh! 
Waah! I want my mommy! 
Battles achieve nothing! Take my hand! It’s about love!
I didn’t mean to battle--but take my hand! It’s about love! 
Battling is futile! Take my hand! It’s about love! 
I dropped my glasses. I can’t see straight.
I guess I won. I can’t see enough to tell. 
I guess I lost. I can’t see enough to tell. 
Steadily and surely. You build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won! 
But I did things steadily and surely... 
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha! 
Sob, sob, sob... 
Everybody gather around for my stupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn’t that amusing? 
Nrrgh... I am not amused. 
I shall train with you.
Show some spine! On your feet! 
Fine! That will do! 
Why get all intellectual about things? If it’s fun, why question it?
See, I can still win. I don’t see a problem! 
So I lost! If it’s fun, it’s cool! 
I expect you to be good... Don’t you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced... 
You’ve got good things. 
My papa and mama are high-skill Trainers, too.
It’s in my lineage! 
Papa, Mama! I’m so sorry! 
I go all out in battle, no matter what.
The inevitable conclusion! 
I concede! 
This is it! The biggest battle in my life! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah! 
This sets me back to being a Lass... 
My love of nature and Pokémon made a Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too! 
Ooh... I still love to battle, too. 
Hi! Have you ever considered a career as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your skill level. 
Yes, you’ve got the mettle. Being a Ranger is a lot of fun! 
Win or lose, a battle happens only once!
Do you have any regrets? 
I have no regrets! 
It’s my sworn duty to protect nature and the Pokémon in it.
It’s a challenging life, but there’s a lot to enjoy every day. 
It’s a rewarding career. How does it sound to you? 
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking on you!
Well? Satisfied? 
Well, aren’t you tough? I’m a little stunned! 
I didn’t sleep while trying to come up with this new strategy!
My strategy worked! 
Oh, but... I really needed to sleep tonight... 
The credo of the Dragon Tamer! Number one!
In victory, roar! Roar with your dragon! 
Even in defeat, roar! Roar with your dragon! 
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am! 
...Urf... I wanted to be strong... 
See it! Feel it! The ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the ultimate... Probably! 
The title of the ultimate probably! I confer it on you! 
Oh, wow! Rare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That’s what you get for letting down your guard. 
Tch. Couldn’t fool you. 
I can’t stand getting cold, but I’m quite good.
Ch-chatter... Wa-wahaha. I won, I won! 
Ch-chatter... Urr... I’m getting sleepy... 
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me! Not too shabby! 
I like the sense you show! 
Snow is wonderful! Everything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic! 
I’m whiting out... 
Don’t you think this coat is cute? It limits my movements, though.
It’s toasty warm. 
I feel snowed under... 
I’m the one! Number one out of all the kids in shorts!
See? That’s what being number one is about! 
Darn... I’m number one... 
I’m the one! The only one true one among shorts-wearing kids!
See? That’s what being the only one is about! 
Darn... I’m the only one... 
Um... I’m pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won? Um? S-sorry. 
Er, um... Th-thank you... 
Here goes!
Bravo! 
Yelp! 
You learn too!
The harsh realities of battling! 
The joy of victory! 
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn. 
I get it now. In that situation, I should have used that move. 
My teacher gave me advice on battling.
My teacher was right! That was just so easy! 
Aww, my teacher was wrong! None of it worked! 
Why are we battling? I don’t get it.
Why? I don’t understand. 
Why did you win? What happens now? 
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another brand. You know who’ll win, right?
I’m not interested in what was an inevitable result. 
But how... My... The Pokémon I’ve raised... 
There isn’t anything that I can’t buy. Money can buy battles!
There’s nothing that money can’t buy. 
I’ll give you my allowance if you’ll let me win. 
You know, I’m really not cut out for doing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah! 
You swine! Now I’m steamed! 
I’ll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done! 
Lickety-split is how I’ll excuse myself! 
Crunch-crunch... Crunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies... 
What am I standing on? Busted Poké Balls? 
The way of the Bug Catcher! Bear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher! 
All hail Bug Catchers! 
Feast your eyes on secret techniques of the ancients!
See? What did you think? Are you awestruck? 
That’s my cue to disappear in a puff of smoke. 
I see it!
Think not ill of me... 
Gyoeeeh! 
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah! 
Pi pika... 
A battle, you say? I’m never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee! I won, I won! 
Urk... We lost... 
It’s my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank! 
Ugagaah! You rotten thief! 
You can shake hands with me! It would be quite the honor for you!
If you’d won, I would have even given you my autograph! 
My management team will have something to say about this! 
Run! Don’t think! Run!
Faster! More! More! Faster! 
Run! Keep running for me! 
Hiya. Nice to meet ya.
All right. Nice seeing ya. 
All right. Thanks for coming by. 
My cohorts call me the emperor of fishing!
I landed another big one today! 
Why the emperor of fishing? It’s an ancient Chinese legend... 
When you get as good as me, you can win easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz... 
Sssnore... 
My mom and I travel around in search of lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and tend to crops every single day. 
You sure seem to be hectic. 
Win! That’s what I’ll do again today! I’ll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha! I’m not gonna lose my whole life! 
Nooooo! No way! I didn’t lose! 
Allow me to examine your prowess as a collector.
You’re still wanting. I urge you to keep at it. 
That’s quite the collection. I’m willing to relieve you of the lot. 
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir! 
Owowowoooh! 
I want you to hear it! A shout from the heart!
I love music! 
Let’s hear it for an encore! 
Battle? I’m up for that.
Wow. Good stuff. 
Thanks much. 
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap! 
I’m gonna pluck you for that! 
Sure, let’s duke it out!
Let’s battle again! 
You’re not half bad! 
Looking out over the sea’s breaking waves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar! Daddy! 
Wroaaaar! Mommy! 
Come on! Take a run at me! I can take it!
So, what’d you think? I was too burly for you to handle? 
Good job! Way to overcome my size! 
Waah! Wait! Wait a second! My mind’s not into this yet!
Hunh? It’s over already? What? I won, you say? 
Huh? Hah? It’s over already? What? I lost, you say? 
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk. Got some?
Wahaha! I get the win! Let’s celebrate over some milk! 
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk! Bring me some Moomoo Milk! 
You’re under arrest! You’re under arrest!
Takedown! 
Officer down! 
I’m not a real Policeman. I’m a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you. You should try to find one you like. 
I must say, battling is a wonderful thing. 
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the next. That’s how it goes. 
I might win tomorrow. That’s what I believe. 
I’m throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo! 
It’s over! 
The indefatigable Camper makes his stand!
You can become a devotee if you’d like. 
I wish I could become your devotee. 
I don’t think I have any chance of winning, but sure, I’ll battle.
Wow, I wasn’t expecting to win. 
I knew I’d lose. I’m so sorry for this. 
I think you’re awfully interested in me, aren’t you?
You lost because you were paying too much attention to me. 
Why did you win? I thought you liked me. 
Win or lose, let’s not bear any grudges.
Yay, yay, yay! We did it! 
Oh, you! Don’t ever forget this! 
Pokémon are for adults, too... Let me show you...
What do you think? Am I deep like an old blues man? 
Though it cuts me deep, it’s a man’s lot in life to endure the pain... 
What I have here isn’t really a guitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt... 
This here is a keyboard synth. 
For work, I sometimes get to be a Swimmer or a Beauty.
An idol can become anybody! 
But the real me... I’m still a Lass in a miniskirt! 
Let’s enjoy ourselves. I hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun! 
Yowch! Watch it! You play too rough! 
I’ll put an end to this! With my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is complete and perfectly strong... 
Why? Why?! Why did I lose?! 
Living with Pokémon... Every day is the greatest.
Ehehe... Pokémon are the best... 
It’s not a problem if I lose. I still have my Pokémon... 
I have my Pokémon. I don’t need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy every day. 
Isn’t that the same for you? Isn’t it? 
You won’t guess it now, but I was quite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know. 
I feel nostalgic for those days... 
Do your best! My beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done! Mama’s proud of you! 
My Pokémon are my beloved family. 
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which. Let’s do this!
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which, but sorry. 
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which, but you’re sure tough! 
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it’s over. 
Too much for me to handle! 
We’re going for the win! Hey-ho, let’s go!
Yay! Vavavoom! 
Aww, we lost... Sniffle... 
Let me introduce to you my cherished partners!
How did you find them? My cherished partners. 
Awawa... My partners... 
Winning and losing isn’t all there is to battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when I win. 
The effort you put in is what’s important. 
It’s no good to be too harsh... But pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep and complex challenge. 
Balance is key for raising good Pokémon. 
I’ll check how your Pokémon have grown for you.
Not good enough! Your training style’s not up to par. 
This is impressive! You’ve raised your Pokémon really thoroughly. 
I’ll win. No lie.
See? 
Huh! 
Fwaah! Fwaah! You think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah! I win! 
Fwaah! 
I’ve caught you now. Give up.
You weren’t bad. Let’s meet again. 
How could this be...? 
Yo, yo! Let’s have a fun time!
Thank you! Let’s play again! 
Thanks! Play with me again! 
You’re no good at all. I’d better teach you.
No, no, this won’t do at all. Up on your feet. Never give up! 
You’ve got good skills. You tried hard, too. Excellent! 
I’m jacking up the power to max! All the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I’m feeling electric! 
Eeyow! I got zapped! 
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak! Keep trying! 
Hoh! You are tough! Give me a rematch! 
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That’s it? 
OK... Quite remarkable... 
Ahaha! Too bad for you! I’m your opponent!
Ahaha! 
Aha... Ahaha... 
Are you nervous? Leave it to the dude!
That was a good battle. I hope we can meet again. 
Whew... The dude wasn’t expecting to lose. 
The power of nature! Let me show you!
This is the power of nature! 
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
See? I thought this would happen. 
Boo! Boo! This is not right! 
Fuhahaha! Your next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you could defeat me? 
Fuhahaha! Let us meet again! 
Off you go! Face my team of totally trained Pokémon!
Bravo! I knew my Pokémon would do it! 
Oh, no! That’s awful! What have you done to my Pokémon?! 
A battle is deadly earnest! Not a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard! 
I seemed to have let my mind wander... 
Hey!
Heeey! 
Hey... 
I’m tough, that’s all.
I won, that’s all. 
I lost, that’s all. 
Shaah!
Hwooh! 
Hawah! 
I’ve been here for years, but I never get tired of this.
You might not think so, but I’m still a kid. I’m in the same grade as you. 
I’d like to keep battling Pokémon even when my hair is gray. 
Let me make one thing clear... You aren’t capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible chance of you beating me. 
How could this be...? Only that girl with the inner tube has beaten me... 
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days... So careless. 
Children these days... Quite exuberant, methinks. 
I would like my children to become strong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn’t do if my children were only as good as you... 
It would be nice if they were as skilled as you... 
Behold you shall! Psychic-mystifying power!
You see? Psychic-mystifying power! 
No, but... Psychic-mystifying power... 
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family! That’ll be enough already! 
My beloved family... 
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy? 
Ooorgh... My head’s spinning... 
My big brother told me! Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it! My big brother’s plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower the foe’s accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough. This is gonna be fun!
I thought so! You are tough! 
Yup, you sure are tough. Keep it up! 
Ah, welcome! I’m your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill? 
Thank you so much! 
Hello. Whatcha having?
Thanks a million! 
Be seeing ya! 
I love cute customers like you! I’ll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way I served you? 
Oh, but... I’m not done serving you. 
Stare...
You’ve got something on your nose. 
You’re cool, all right. I had to stare. 
I’ve waited a long time for a Trainer like you to come along.
Yup, you’re as tough as I thought. You even had me in trouble! 
I knew it! You are a tough Trainer! 
Now how should I conduct this offensive?
Oh, now I need a better effort out of you than that. 
Oh, you’re finished and content? OK, another time, then. 
My Pokémon have a different taste from the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference? My party has rich depth. 
Did you notice the difference? My party is refreshingly dry. 
Hiya! Tough-looking Trainer, aren’t you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling up in me! 
Ooch... You’re too much to handle. 
Varrroooom! Watch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom! I’m not close to redlining! 
Vrrr... Vrruuu... I’m flat out of gas... 
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech! 
Thud! 
It’s my dream to cycle with my boyfriend.
No riding double, though! 
I wish I had a boyfriend! 
What’s your motive? What brought you here?
You lose. Now what will you do? 
Play it again. 
We’ll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique. 
I remain humbled... 
You’re serious? A battle? And that’s against me?
Cackle! You shouldn’t have tried! 
Double wow! 
I’ll dance and sing and rivet your attention!
Ooh, baby! 
So much for riveting your attention. You nailed my Pokémon! 
Ready, start!
First across the finish line! 
Waah! Wait for me! 
Can you explain why I’m here?
I mean, who are you? 
Why am I battling here? 
My fishing-rod-handling technique is the best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it? Surprised, I bet! 
How I handle my fishing rod has nothing to do with battling... 
The two loves of my life are fishing and battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big fish or win a big battle. 
I was born to fish and battle! 
I come here on a ship. Big ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like. Very nice place. 
You want go to sea? My ship, we will see wonderful things. 
Huh? You’re my opponent? This is kind of unnerving...
I’m surprised... I didn’t think I’d win. 
See, I told you... I thought you were tough. 
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming! 
Thanks for your time! 
Let’s be good sports about this! Big smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha! Come on, you laugh too! 
I’m cheerful even in defeat! Ahaha! Ahaha! 
Buck up.
Not bad. 
You’re good. 
The sweetest thing about battling? The finishing blow!
Take that! That’s my finishing move! 
Oof... I feel your final shots... 
Hey, you’re looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right? 
Hey, you’re kind of tough. 
Listen! This is my chorus group. Me and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop! 
Oh, wait! We’re not done singing! 
I got tips from my online friends on how to best raise my gang.
I must thank my online friends. I don’t know who they are, though. 
Well, this blows! My online buddies let me down! 
Can I have a moment? I’m trying to write some e-mail.
I need to get home quick and check on my e-mail. 
What do you think you’re doing? I want to go already. 
Father... Mother... Please watch over me...
Father... Mother... Were you watching...? 
Father... Mother... Please forgive me... 
Can’t rightly say I much like battling, I tell you.
I won, but... I’m still shaking... 
Grr... I’m so angry I could cry... 
It’s the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed? That’s the power of science! 
It’s inconceivable... How could the power of science be defeated? 
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the fruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory! I’ll get my professorship now! 
What kind of experiments? That’s classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for this battle.
Googoo gagga. 
Gagga... 
Fwahahaha! You’ve come a long way!
Fwahahahaha! 
Fwahahaha! You’re blessed to have your friends! 
I’ll scrap you.
I’ll recycle you. 
Think ecology. Think green. 
Why, sure! Sounds great! We have to do this!
Bam! All done! 
A battle while working... It’s a good way to take a break. 
I’ll try to do my best! Please give me this chance!
I’ve done it! I’ve achieved my goal! 
I tried the best I could! Thank you for your encouragement! 
A battle is... It is a love letter written in sand.
Did you understand what I’m trying to say? I guess you wouldn’t. 
Did you understand what I’m trying to say? I guess you wouldn’t. 
Hello, you there! Yes, you! Hold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn’t be out now. Go home, and be quick about it. 
You shouldn’t mess with a police officer like that. 
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble... Wait for me... Sssnork... 
Mutter... Ehehe... Ssssnore... 
Let’s keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes! 
You’re quite the Trainer yourself! 
A battle isn’t something you can calculate.
What’d I tell you? You win when you win. 
What’d I say, huh? You lose when you lose. 
There’s lots in life that doesn’t go the way you want.
Yippee! Things went my way! 
See...? 
There’s nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion! 
Farewell! 
I wait for tough Trainers here, come rain or shine.
Because of that, I’ve grown so very strong... 
Won’t a tough... No, forget that. I need a cool Trainer to come... 
This is for keeping the sun off.
I’m strong at battling, but I can’t take sunlight... 
I don’t want to roast my skin. 
Well... Those are rare Pokémon...
I’ve never caught those... Your Pokémon are different, all right. 
Oh, you’re a Trainer? You’re not a Pokémon? 
Ready?
Cool. 
Bye. 
Beat me? Try again in another ten years!
No spine! 
You’re tough! You inspire me! 
Smelling sweet scents makes me so drowsy...
...Yawn... Oh? Are we finished so soon? 
...Yawn... Oh, really? I lost? 
You’re sure you can handle me? I’m an ultrastellar talent.
Don’t feel bad! I’m an ultrastellar talent! 
You’re in the miracle-star class! 
I live only for battles. Only victories give me hope.
...Naturally. 
Who are you...? 
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what you’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again! 
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you... I can live with that. 
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what you’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again! 
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you... I can live with that.

Forget it! This isn’t over yet! 
My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a bit tight. 
What’s going on here? What, I lost?! 
Think you can take down the  next Pokémon like you did earlier? 
No way! Not yet! Not giving up! 
W-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon! 
You avoided the long way around? Let’s see why you’d do that! 
Now I understand why you decided to battle with me. 
You should go whichever way you want, shortcut or the long way! 
Only those who want to win can challenge a Pokémon Gym! 
Gggh... This is humiliating! 
One day, I’m going to become a tough Trainer like you. 
You’re a Pokémon Trainer! I happen to be a Pokémon Trainer! Our eyes met, so battle we must! 
Too strong! Too strong!
Don’t be shy about talking to Trainers you’d like to battle. Pokémon grow stronger and stronger from battling.
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here, just look! 
Let’s have a Pokémon battle! Humph! But I’m gonna win! 
You’re, like, wow!
It’s fun to battle others! I’m gonna battle all sorts of people!
Let’s have another Pokémon battle! This time, I’m gonna win! 
I spy, with my little eye... A Trainer! A battle, please! 
Oh, boo! I can’t win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out! I need to go to a Poké Center!
Oh, hi! I remember you, Trainer! A battle, please! 
I’m full of energy because I get power from my Pokémon! 
Oh! My poor BIDOOF and ZUBAT!
Avoid tall grass... Or avoid Trainers... Do you have trouble deciding? 
You look familiar, Trainer. Can I have another match? 
We’re always together. I’ll show you how we’ve bonded! 
It’s got me down... 
I don’t bear grudges over losing. But I promise I’ll get tougher! 
I’m always with my Pokémon. Actually, you’re always with your Pokémon too, aren’t you? 
Gimme a battle so I can see if I’m ready for the Pokémon Gym challenge! 
I guess it means I’m not ready for the Gym challenge yet... 
I guess if you don’t have a single Gym Badge, you’re a total nobody... 
I’m about to take the Pokémon Gym challenge. But before I go, I wanna spar with you. 
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City! 
Oh, I lost! Lalala! 
I’m going to collect lots of Gym Badges! I’ll work with my Pokémon! 
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City! ...Did I show you already? 
I found a Trainer while looking for some Pokémon! 
Hunh? You’re finished so soon? 
I walk through tall grass until I find the Pokémon I want. 
I found a familiar-looking Trainer! 
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer... Do you want to have a go? 
Aww... I should have said no. 
I didn’t know you’re so tough... I’m going to train harder too! 
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer! Will you give me a rematch? 
My dad gave me some Pokémon! They’re gonna win for me! 
But they’re Pokémon I got from my dad... 
Who gave you your first Pokémon? Your first Pokémon is the one with the most fond memories, I think. 
I’m gonna win this time with the Pokémon I got from my dad! 
May I please trouble you for a battle? 
Oh... You’re so strong... 
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon was holding a Berry... 
Oh, thank you for the last time. May I please trouble you for another battle? 
Say, listen. What’s your opinion on bug Pokémon? 
I’m not going to be able to explain the charms of bug Pokémon this way! 
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do stuff like poison and paralyze, and they’re cute and yet cool. You gotta believe me. They’re good! 
So, listen. Tell me you’ve grown to like bug Pokémon since we last met? 
Let’s have a battle while smelling the aroma of flowers! 
Even though I lost, I’m not angry because it smells so nice. 
Maybe I’ll put some Accessories on my Pokémon at the TV station in Jubilife City. 
You came back to me because you couldn’t forget the smell of flowers! 
Liv: We can one-shot this Trainer, can’t we, Liz? 
Liv: Oh, oh, oh? 
Liv: Awww! That is so bad! 
Liv: You only have one Pokémon? That’s so boring!
Liv: Oh! You’re that Trainer! Let’s get payback, Liz! 
Liz: We’re the strongest in our class! 
Liz: Oh, but, wait! 
Liz: I wish I could be strong like you when I get bigger. 
Liz: Um, will you battle with us? Me and Liv? 
Liz: We’re the best in our class. We can’t be losers all the time! 
How about a quick battle before I leave for Eterna Forest? 
That really dampened my spirits. 
They say there are rough Pokémon in Eterna Forest. I’d better be more prepared than this. 
You’ve been to Eterna Forest already, right? How was it? 
It’s a long way between Floaroma and Eterna City. So, let’s battle! 
Wawawaah! I’m out of Pokémon that can go! 
With my Pokémon by my side, I’m sure any camping will be a blast! 
While I was enjoying camping, my Pokémon got all buffed up! 
What kinds of Pokémon live around here, I wonder? 
I’m shocked! How did I lose? 
What can I tell you about Pokémon? Well, there are males and females. And some that you can’t tell!
Oh, hi! We meet again! Have you seen any rare Pokémon? 
Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little? 
Oh, boo! How insulting! 
Listen very closely... Can you hear the cries of Pokémon? 
Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little again? 
There’s no mountain here, but I’m dressed to hike! Gahaha! Here goes! 
Oh, yeah! A refreshing battle that was! 
You can find the same kinds of Pokémon in all sorts of places. There’s no law saying a Hiker can’t go searching off in the mountains! 
If you meet someone in the mountains, they’re no longer strangers. Meet them twice, and they’re your friend! 
Of all places possible, I’ve lost my way here... 
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost the battle too... 
From being lost in the mountains so long, I became a Hiker... 
I’ve lost my way again... I’m betrayed by my sense of direction. 
Osu! I’m not trained to hold back! 
I... I concede! You’re in a different class... 
You taught me how I measure up! Thank you! 
Osu! This time, I’m fully committed! 
I love Pokémon that smell sweet. Like this one--get a whiff of this! 
Did you understand what I meant? Didn’t my Pokémon smell nice? 
If you plant lots of Berries, you can be surrounded by sweet scents. 
Sniff... Oh? Your Pokémon smells nice! 
Nothing’s biting... I could use a break, I suppose. 
Oh, well. I should’ve been a little more serious about this. 
! Yank your fishing rod when that appears. That’s how you fish. 
All right! I caught some tough Pokémon. I’m ready for battle! 
I landed myself a feisty Trainer! Let’s go! 
I let a big win slip away... 
Do you have a fishing rod? Catch some big ones! 
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught a big one! Let’s battle again! 
I fished up some tough Pokémon! Let’s have ourselves a battle! 
Losing has my emotions all knotted up! 
My feet are tangled, too! Ouch! Ouch! 
I’m going to win this time! I said I’ll win, and I mean it! 
Yo! Having a good time cycling? 
Hey, not bad, you! 
Cycling Road’s teeming with Pokémon Trainers, too! 
I’m sure I’ve seen your face before. Did we maybe battle? 
Hey! Watch where you’re going! Or did you want to challenge me? 
My efforts were meaningless... 
I might try racing through Cycling Road in one long shot. 
There you are! I’ve been riding in this spot so I’d get a rematch with you! 
Your Bike is the type that can shift gears, huh? Let me see if you know how to ride it properly. 
Crash! Tinkle... 
Huh? I was supposed to be checking if you know how to shift gears. Why am I checking out your Pokémon? 
Let me see if you’ve learned how to ride your Bike properly. I’ll check you out again! 
A Bicycle can only take you as far as your energy will allow. 
Gasp... Gasp... Gasp... 
My Pokémon are out of gas. So am I. I’m going to head home soon... 
I got plenty of rest at home. I’m not losing this time! 
I worked up a good sweat riding! I’m feeling great! Let’s battle! 
Whew! You worked us over. 
Do you find yourself pedaling backward going downhill? 
I worked up a good sweat riding! I feel ready for a rematch! 
You and I, we’re both riding Bikes. And you’ve got Pokémon. I don’t want to lose to you! 
Oh, geez... I seem to have fallen off my Bike.
Instead of a battle, I should’ve challenged you to a Bike race! 
I hate knowing you’ve beaten me. This time, I’m going to win! 
I love my Bike! But I’m not very good at fixing flat tires... 
Kerrrash!
I admire people who understand gadgets. I’m clueless about how my Pokétch works. 
I want to practice repairing flat tires... But I’ve been practicing with my Pokémon to get our revenge! 
Some people compete over speed, and some compete over technique. Which kind are you? 
You’re a speedy technician! 
I enjoy the scenery. Don’t you think the area below Cycling Road looks nice? 
I polished up both my speed and techniques. Can you beat me now? 
Whoa! You startled me! Well, we may as well battle! 
Your power startles me! 
We Hikers are bighearted guys! Losing doesn’t bother us! 
Whoa! You startled me! We may as well have a rematch! 
I wear shorts the whole year! I’ve got energy to burn! 
Having lots of energy isn’t good enough... 
My Pokémon don’t wear anything. I worry that they’ll be cold. 
I wear shorts! I have lots of energy! I’m not losing to you! 
Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do my best, too! 
Oh... We lost... 
Did you know? You can dig up Fossils in the Underground! Those Fossils can be turned back into Pokémon at the mining museum! 
Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do more than my best this time! 
Go do it, my Pokémon! I’ll work hard, too! 
Oh... We lost...
I think we’ll go visit the TV station in Jubilife City next. 
Ummm... You’re the Trainer who beat us before, aren’t you? We’re feeling good today, so let’s have another battle! 
Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune! 
Wahahaha! There’s nothing that I can do but laugh! 
Wahaha! ...Go ahead and laugh at me. 
Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune! Forgetting your gloves brings a cold! 
I just got through Mt. Coronet, but we’ve still got fuel in the tank! 
Whoops! Didn’t take much to beat us! 
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City before heading to Mt. Coronet again. 
I just got through Mt. Coronet, and who do I see? A Trainer who we’ve battled before! 
OK, OK! Let’s be quick about this! 
No way! Give us another battle! ...Oh, right. I’m out of Pokémon. 
Yup! I like the way you battle. 
What took you so long? We’ve waited here a long time for a rematch with you! 
Gahahaha! You’re just a little kid! How’re you supposed to beat a big man like me? 
I’m a grown-up, but I got served by some little kid! 
Wow, you’re sure impressive! I guess it makes no difference if you’re young or old in battles. 
Hey, you, tough little kid! Throw us a rematch, will you? 
They call me The Echo Man! Battle with me! Yahoo! 
Ohh... Yo... Yodelay... 
Let The Echo Man give you a good word of advice! If you don’t know where you should be going, check the Town Map. 
Oh, hi there! Remember us? I’m The Echo Man! Let’s have another battle! Yahoo! 
If I beat you, will you share some food with me? 
We were starved for food, and now we’re starved for a win... 
Sigh... I feel even hungrier... Maybe I’ll chow down some Berries... But that’s kind of gross. What am I, a Pokémon? 
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch before we started climbing. If I beat you this time, share some food with me! 
This karate man will pulverize you! 
I still lack power... 
I need to work out more. My Pokémon do, too! 
This karate man hasn’t forgotten being pulverized by you! 
Muhihi... I’ll haul you up and out! 
My favorite word is restraint. Especially in battle. 
You need a Good Rod if you want to catch good Pokémon. 
Muhihi... There won’t be any restraint this time, OK? 
Oh, you want to have a battle? I was meaning to enter a Contest, but beating you won’t take long... 
Oh, you have us beaten. 
You and your Pokémon have so much energy. I think you would do well in Contests, too. 
Oh, didn’t we meet before? I was meaning to enter a Contest, but let’s have a quick battle first. 
You and I! Let us create a scene! A fantastic tableau of battle! 
Magnificent! I am aglow with inspiration! 
That battle will surely become a stupendous masterpiece painting! I shall title it... “My Pokémon Is Fight”! 
The key to becoming a good painter is to be observant. That is the same for battling. One must be observant! 
Let me see how much you’ve raised your Pokémon. 
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in impeccable condition. 
It’s obvious you raise your Pokémon with a lot of love. 
I’ve raised my Pokémon since we met. How much have you raised yours? 
Listen, if you don’t mind, I’d like to have a battle with your Pokémon. 
Giggle... They’re raised with a lot of care! 
If you treat your Pokémon with care, they’ll reward you with friendship and loyalty.
I don’t want to ever battle with people who don’t treat Pokémon nice! But I know you treat yours kindly. I’ll battle you anytime! 
Hi, there! Where’re you from? What kinds of Pokémon have you got? 
Fancy folks like you have fancy Pokémon too, it looks like. 
I hope my pa didn’t spy me slacking off from work here. 
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again? What kinds of Pokémon’d you bring? 
I jog every morning to keep my Pokémon fit. 
Oops! You threw off my running rhythm. 
Being healthy is number one! Why don’t you come running with me? 
Do you jog every morning, too? 
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots of people. I have trouble remembering faces, but we did meet before, right? 
                      
                            
                           
                   
                         
                                      
               
              
                        
Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon! 
I’m so angry... 
I want to be a Pokémon when I grow up! 
Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon! ...I think you already know, but we’re going to battle again! 
                       
           
                        
Ty: You’re not supposed to intrude on my time with Sue! 
Ty: I only have eyes for Sue. Maybe that’s why we lost? 
Ty: Sue, even in defeat, you’re so beautiful...! 
Ty: I don’t want to do anything without Sue... Bring two Pokémon at least, OK? 
Ty: Did you come back to intrude on my time with Sue? 
Sue: Huh? You want to battle with me? I will if I can team with Ty! 
Sue: I’m sorry, Ty! 
Sue: We lost... Ty, I need a hug to make it all better! 
Sue: I only want to do things with Ty! Don’t you have two Pokémon? 
Sue: Oh, it’s you again! I’ll battle if I can team with Ty! 
                      
                   
                                 
                                               
                                
                       
                                               
                                                      
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about rhythm, too! 
In a sense, I suppose that was a finish line of sorts. 
When your rhythm gets thrown off, everything seems out of whack. 
When I was jogging the other day, a wild Pokémon came after me. I ran so fast, I was on top of the waves, I swear!
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about rhythm, too. Our rematch is also about rhythm! 
Emma: We battle together! That’s why we’re tough! 
Emma: Waaah! 
Emma: You’re awesome! Are you maybe a Pokémon genius? 
Emma: We won’t play with you if you don’t have two Pokémon! 
Emma: When I battle with Lil, we shouldn’t lose! 
Lil: We’re gonna crunch and munch you all up! 
Lil: Hwaaah! 
Lil: We’re going to be tough Trainers, too! We decided! 
Lil: Only one Pokémon is too lonesome! 
Lil: You munched us all up last time, but it’s our turn now! 
Hey, check this out! Look at the luster of my Pokémon’s fur! 
Hey, hey, did you take a good look? 
Every day, I brush my Pokémon a hundred strokes. Then, I do me. 
I brushed my party a lot. So we’d be ready for a rematch! 
I’m a rookie breeder, but I’ll do my very best! 
It’s all right! I’m still a rookie! 
How to raise Pokémon? Umm... It’s all about love, right? 
I can’t be a rookie forever. I’ve learned a lot since we last met. 
                             
           
                                             
                      
                
                         
                                               
                           
                                
                               
                              
                          
                            
                           
          
                               
                           
        
                                
                                
                
                              
Teri: Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of Pokémon! 
Teri: Even with both of us, we lost. 
Teri: Our mommy is a twin, too. 
Teri: We want to battle with lots of Pokémon. 
Teri: Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of Pokémon again! 
Tia: Yay! We’re gonna have a battle with three Trainers! 
Tia: We two couldn’t win. 
Tia: When Mommy and Aunty and me and Teri get together, it’s really confusing and fun! 
Tia: We want to have a battle with three Trainers.
Tia: Yay! We’re gonna have another battle with three Trainers! 
My Pokémon toughened up from working on the ranch. I’m right proud of them! 
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be counted on! 
When I cuddle with my Pokémon, I can feel not just their bodies’ warmth, but their compassion. 
Howdy! You’re that tough little Trainer! I remember you! Check out my farm-toughened Pokémon! They’re my pride and joy! 
I’m warmed up and limber. I’m OK to battle! 
Um... I wasn’t emotionally ready. 
Actually, I wanted to make a run for it... That’s a joke. 
I’m going to keep running. Just as long as there’s a road... 
I’ve been training so I can have a rematch with you. I’m OK to battle! 
Matt: Uhohoho! I’ll show y’all how tightly I’ve bonded with my daughter! 
Matt: Parent-and-child power couldn’t get the job done. 
Matt: I reckon the bonds between you and your Pokémon are like the bonds parents share with their kids. 
Matt: Oh, there’s no way you could beat us both with one Pokémon. 
Matt: Ayuh? You’re here to check the bond I have with my daughter again? 
Ava: I can get away with slacking off if I have my Pokémon out! 
Ava: Oh, sheesh! 
Ava: Papa, I’m sorry! I promise I’ll work harder starting tomorrow! 
Ava: You’re battling me and my pa. One Pokémon won’t cut it, dear! 
Ava: Oh, hi! It’s good y’all came calling on us again! I can take a break from work if I’m battling Pokémon. Lucky for me! 
I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I concede defeat... 
My cover is blown, so what should I do? Maybe I’ll go catch some Contests in Hearthome City. Maybe I’ll do that. 
Do you remember me? I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I concede defeat... 
While I hid in the tall grass, I sensed Pokémon all around me! Furtive sounds of movement... Stifled cries... I heard them! 
You don’t remember me? I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! 
I am one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle! But how did you discover me? Don’t tell me you’re a ninja, too! 
I concede defeat... 
A Pokémon Trainer’s good at finding stuff, I guess. 
You should join us so we can form the Ninja Quartet! Anyways, let’s battle! 
You seem to have a lot of confidence. Let’s see if it’s justified! 
Haha! A total loss for me! 
You seem to have an abundance of talent. It’s pretty amazing. 
When I lost to you last time, I was just unlucky. 
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take battles in stride. I need to stay cool and calm whether I win or lose. 
Aiyeeeeh! We lost! 
How dare you beat us! Go away! Go! 
Last time, I got a little emotional over losing... I’ll stay cool and calm today! 
Me lose to someone so young? I daresay not! 
The power of youth... It’s startling. 
Somehow, it makes me happy seeing a young, yet sure-footed, Trainer such as yourself. 
The power of youth and the technique of the Veteran... Let us battle again to see which shall prevail! 
This buff physique isn’t just for show! 
Ugwaaaah! 
Why? Is it because my training isn’t enough?! 
My buff physique! Feast your eyes on it again! 
I just startled you! While you’re still struggling to recover, I’ll already be the winner! 
Oh, what’s that? You’re supposed to be fumbling more. 
I need a better reaction out of you. I feel silly hiding for so long! 
You just saw me, and I bet you thought, “Long time no see.” While you’re still thinking that, I’ll already be the winner! 
We ninjas appear where you least expect us! 
I didn’t expect to lose... 
When I hide out like this, I think about what it must be like for Pokémon inside their Poké Balls. 
Wah! Another chance encounter with a foe who defeated me before! 
A ninja can use all sorts of cool techniques! 
Hmm... My ninja techniques failed to work... 
There’s a ninja Gym Leader somewhere far away. I should become a devotee of theirs. 
What’s with you? You’re not a ninja yet? 
Don’t be shocked when you see my Pokémon! 
Oh... My... Gosh... 
A dragon Pokémon’s real power is nothing like mine! 
You again? You must really like that dragon Pokémon I use. 
I’ll teach you about the charms of bird Pokémon! 
Wow. I’ll admit to being surprised by that outcome. 
The sight of you battling... It was simply a wonder to watch! 
Are you finally noticing the great qualities of bird Pokémon? 
Zac: Jen, watch this! I’m going to use everything you’ve taught me! 
Zac: Wow. Someone that’s even better than Jen... 
Zac: I don’t care if I get to meet the greatest Trainer in the region... I’d still rather learn from Jen. 
Zac: Wouldn’t you rather battle with the two of us? 
Zac: This time, I’m not gonna let you down, Jen! I promise! 
Jen: Here comes a Trainer. Zac, you ready? Let’s do this! 
Jen: I just got embarrassed in front of my little buddy here... 
Jen: Zac, I’m so sorry. I’m a failure as your instructor. 
Jen: Would you like to have a two-on-two Pokémon battle with us? 
Jen: Here comes our Trainer! Are you ready this time? 
Look at these beautiful wings! 
Oh, you! I’m going to peck you for that! 
People say there’s a bird Pokémon that can learn human speech. Do you know anything about it? 
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous wings. It must have been some sort of a mistake that we lost last time! 
                 
                  
              
ZUBAT! Doesn’t that sound like a ninja bursting from cover? 
Oh! My ZUBAT tristars... 
Sowing confusion among the foe is one way a ninja battles. A Pokémon can’t overcome its confusion unless it switches out. 
The shinobi live by speed! I’ll get in my attacks before you do! 
See how Mt. Coronet towers above us. I want to be big like that one day! 
A powerful presence towers before me... It is you! 
Mt. Coronet has long been known as an ancient and mysterious mountain. 
Hmm?! You tower before me again? It’s as if you’re Mt. Coronet! 
Hah! Hah! I’m psyched for this! Here goes! 
I don’t get why we can’t win. 
I guess I ought to study winning techniques for a change... 
Hah! Hah! This time, I’m psyched up! 
Speed is a ninja’s best weapon! Can you keep up? 
I did a lot to conceal myself, too... 
I’ll wait here for a weaker-looking Trainer and then ambush them! 
I became even faster! How can you hope to keep up? 
I go everywhere with my NOCTOWL. We’re gonna show you owl best! Ha! 
We did our best. That’s what matters. Right? 
Even on cold days, just being with my NOCTOWL keeps me warm! 
I curled up inside my NOCTOWL’s wings and waited for you to return! 
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted a Trainer! I must investigate! 
My investigation has revealed the Trainer to be tough! Ouch... 
Celestic Town is an old town. I’m sure to find something cool. 
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted you again! I will now investigate! 
I’ll have you know my Pokémon sleeps on a fancy imported bed. 
H-humph! There’s an unseemly sense of desperation about you. Ugh! 
Oh, my poor little battler is all tuckered out... I’ll let it sleep it off in that bed I had sent from overseas. 
I do this only because I love my Pokémon. Winning isn’t that important. 
I’d like to begin now. Are you quite prepared? 
Oh, how very impressive of you. 
Would you care to inform me of who the amazing tutor you’ve hired for your Pokémon is? 
Oh, I’m delighted to see you again. Are you prepared? 
If it pleases you, would you care for a Pokémon battle with me? 
Your handling of Pokémon is quite impeccable, I must say. 
Bahaha! I was invited by the master of the Pokémon Mansion. 
If it pleases you, would you care for a rematch with me? 
I’ve never battled a young Trainer like you before. I’m quite nervous! 
Oh, dear... That wasn’t anything like battling with my friends. 
Usually, I’ll have matches with members of my social club. 
Oh, it’s you again, dear? It makes me a little nervous to ask, but may I have a rematch? 
                          
                 
                                                      
Hold it right there, citizen! Walking around at night is unsafe! 
You’ve got tough partners with you. Carry on, citizen. Carry on. 
Out so late? Does your mother know you’re out so late? 
Well, hello there! That’s very civil minded of you to say hello to your local Policeman! 
Didn’t I already give you a warning? It’s unsafe to walk around at night! 
Are there any shady-looking characters around here? 
Now, just hold on. I didn’t say that you were shady looking! 
Don’t go hanging out with any shady-looking characters! You hear? 
Patrolling night and day sure is exhausting... Yawn... 
Any shady-looking characters around? I’m always on the lookout for punks. Expecting some shady dude to actually pop up... Does that make me weird? 
Let’s enjoy a fierce battle in the chilly night winds! Brrrr! Refreshing! 
It was too dark for me to see very well... Yeah... Too dark. 
Oops, I’d better get back to my beat before the boss radios me... 
Yo! Hanging tough, Trainer? Word! I’m trying to make my lingo more hip! 
Still training this late? That makes you either a bad kid or a good Trainer. Which one is it? 
I’m on patrol seeing whether or not there’s any trouble afoot! 
Big trouble! Officer in need of assistance! 
Your toughness is too much! I’m in serious trouble! 
I don’t know how to say this, but maybe we patrol too much. 
Let me ask you a question! Are you tough enough to take me? 
Can’t you see I’m fishing? Don’t talk! You’ll spook the fish! 
Sheesh... I let a Pokémon, and that battle, get away from me. 
Fishing and battling are delicate things--as am I. Is that wrong? 
You can see I’m fishing, can’t you? Then don’t talk to me! Geez! 
I wish some fishing-loving lady’d come along. But no, it’s all just Trainers. 
Sure, so I lost. But I’ll keep on fishing. 
If you know of any ladies that like fishing, help me sink the hook in ’em! 
Umm... Yeah. Weren’t you that person who preferred Pokémon over fishing? 
Water Pokémon sure get happy when it rains. So do I! 
Oof. Just got trampled right under your feet that time! 
Yup, a kid like you should be running around outside, rain or shine. 
I’ve been fishing here ever since I lost to you. 
Can you keep up with us? 
You’ve got energy to burn! 
However hard you battle, make sure you never harm the environment. Try not to break any branches or trample any plants, OK?
Hey! You’re that high-energy Trainer! I bet you can’t keep up with us now! 
Are you doing your part to protect the environment? I am! 
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted Trainer. 
People, Pokémon... All of us! We’re all a part of nature. 
Heya, long time! Are you enjoying your nature-filled adventure with Pokémon? 
Our job is to protect the natural environment of this region. 
We’ve got to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here. I wish I could live out here. 
What do you think? The environment is unharmed in this area. 
                   
               
                                          
                               
                             
       
                                                           
                                          
I find it reassuring to be on this damp soil... 
Ufufufufu... You had to beat me... 
It feels good to mope here after a loss... Ufufufufu... 
Is Damp my favorite Pokémon ability? Fufufu... Anything will do... 
                             
                
                                   
                            
       
                                 
                  
                        
                             
                           
I’m proud of my Pokémon! Here, I’ll show you why! 
Youch! You sure showed me how tough you were. 
Oh, what have we here? That’s a Pokédex! It records Pokémon data upon sight? I’ve never seen one before! I heard you can move the sun or moon icon to check the Pokémon habitat map by time of day! 
I take down details in my notebook about Pokémon I’ve battled. I’ll write more data down about your Pokémon! 
Oh? Here comes a nice-looking Trainer. This is worth evaluation. 
Our research has arrived at this one conclusion: you’re a tough one! 
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the Great Marsh. You see, countless years ago, this whole area was under the sea. 
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate how much tougher you’ve become since our last encounter? 
There are Pokémon that become more powerful when it rains. 
Like rain, my tears flow from losing... They call me the Rain Woman... 
I want to show off my pretty parasol, but it will get dirty in the rain. Oh, such a big dilemma! 
On rainy days, I get more energetic! 
When it rains, I get more tense! 
It’s not very easy trying to battle while holding an umbrella. 
If it rained every day, I could have my umbrella open all the time. 
It’s not because it’s raining. I just love umbrellas! 
I’ve spotted a sneaky Trainer! 
Defeated by sneakiness... 
I’m sorry, it wasn’t “sneaky”! It should have been “tough”! 
We’re constantly on patrol. That way, it’s safe even at night. 
Whoa! Hold it right there! I’ve spotted a sneaky Trainer! 
I swim the whole year round. I’m not losing a battle at sea! 
I lost in the sea... But I swim the whole year round! 
When you’re out at sea, Water-type Pokémon look more lively. 
I love the sea. It was only by fluke that I lost last time. 
Brr... I’m starting to get chilly. I could use a win to get warmed up. 
The chill of the sea, and the coldness of defeat... It’s a double whammy. 
Look at my lips... They’re the color of prunes! 
Brr... I’m starting to feel chilly. How about a hot Pokémon battle? 
Hi, wave-riding Trainer! How about a battle on the sea? 
You sure schooled me there. 
Maybe I should switch to surfing, too... 
Oh, hi again! You’re that wave-riding Trainer! 
Hello, there! Aren’t you going to swim? 
What’s saltier? My tears or the sea... 
There aren’t many sea routes that you can swim in Sinnoh. It makes me want to take a vacation in the Hoenn region. 
When I see people surfing, I don’t feel jealous or anything. I just simply love to swim! 
Isn’t this nice? I love my inner tube! 
I couldn’t move very well because my inner tube got in the way! 
My mom blew up my inner tube for me. I ran out of breath just opening it! 
You can come back all you like, but you can’t have my inner tube! 
Ehehe... I can battle, too! 
I lost, and now I feel hungry. 
That cloud looks like ice cream! I wish I could eat some! Mmm... 
I’ve been dawdling here all this time! 
                
         
                               
Traveling alone, are you? That’s impressive! How about we battle? 
You’re good, pip-squeak! 
Maybe I’ll go work out down at the restaurant again. That place gets different people in every day, and they all like battles. 
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let’s break the monotony with another battle! 
Awwww! I almost had that fish reeled in! 
You need to have more respect for a grown-up... 
You need to settle down some. 
Awwww! I was just reeling that fish in! ...Oh, no. Not you again! 
                             
                       
                                    
                       
                             
                              
                          
                                  
Let me demonstrate my technique. It’s how this grown-up battles. 
That’s how you attack? Pshaw! 
You’re so much more of a Trainer than you look! 
Give this grown-up another chance to demonstrate her technique. 
It seems to be very mystifying. That’s the sense I get. To show you what I mean, I’ll battle with the Pokémon I found. 
I can’t win with Pokémon that I’m not familiar with... 
It seems to be very mystifying. That’s the sense I get.
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer! I challenge you to battle with the Pokémon I’ve found! 
I’ve been traveling around the world chasing stories on mysteries. It’s made me pretty tough! 
Sigh... That’s a downer. 
There are mysteries waiting for me to investigate around the world. This is no time to be feeling sorry for myself. 
There’s an endless supply of mysteries around the world. Running into you here just happens to be one such mystery! 
                                                       
                
                           
                 
                
                            
                          
                
                        
                     
                        
                               
I’d sensed the presence of a Trainer for a while. It was you! 
Defeating you will be no easy matter. 
Is it possible to become more powerful by understanding Pokémon? 
I was certain that you’d return. I sensed your presence, you see. 
Look out! Behind you! What is it? 
My plan to spook you didn’t go over well at all. 
You might be tough, but let down your guard at your own risk! 
Wah! That thing curled around your neck! ...Nice scarf, kid! 
Win or lose... Who knows how this’ll go? We’re playing for keeps! 
I guess wrong far too often. 
I can’t get into the groove... That’s enough for today. 
I wasn’t feeling lucky the other day. Things will be different today. 
For the sake of my collection, I take on people I know I can’t beat. That’s what a Collector does. 
You should boast more about that last attack. 
I’m proud of having a Pokémon that others don’t have. Oh, and I’m also proud of winning the second prize on Jubilife TV’s daily drawings. 
For the sake of my collection, I keep battling people I can’t beat. That’s what a Collector does. 
Whaaat? You do! You do have a Pokédex! 
I’m so envious of your Pokédex... 
Trainers have all sorts of Pokémon with them, right? So, the more Trainers you battle, the more your Pokédex will fill up! 
I don’t have a Pokédex, but that’s all right. You come here and show me! 
To find my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west, or any which way! 
But they’re my favorite Pokémon! 
If you’re trying to find the Pokémon you want, you need to go everywhere! Not just east and west, either. South and north are important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west, or any which way! ...Saying that, I’ve been wandering around here all this time. 
Oh? You want to teach me something about Pokémon? 
Wow, is that right? 
There are so many kinds of Pokémon. I can’t decide which one to pamper. 
Yoohoo, little kid! Can you teach me some more about Pokémon? 
                          
                 
                         
                        
               
                               
                         
                   
                    
                               
                       
                      
                               
                 
                     
                                                      
I was snoozing, you claim? I merely feigned sleep! Hiyah! 
Gurgle... 
I feigned a loss! Hiyah! 
Am I lost, you ask? I merely feigned it! Hiyah! 
Check the sharpness of my fighting Pokémon’s moves. 
You’ve dulled its sharpness... 
Back to training for us! 
I sharpened my Pokémon’s moves more for when I saw you again! 
Every drop of sweat I shed makes me that much stronger! 
I don’t want to believe this happened, but a loss is a loss. 
Time to shed some more sweat! 
We’re going to win this time! Don’t believe me? Then you test it out! 
Hufff-huff, huff-huff. Want-huff a battle-huff? 
Huff-huff, we-huff lose-huff. 
Bye-huff now-huff. Huff-huff, huff-huff. 
Running-huff is-huff good-huff. Over-huff doing-huff it isn’t-huff! Huff-huff, huff-huff. 
Huff-huff, huff-huff. We-huff meet-huff again-huff? 
I’ll battle anyone. That’s how I’ll get better! 
You won and I lost, but the both of us gained something from this. 
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn’t matter how old or young you are. Your gender doesn’t matter, either. Nothing like that means anything! 
I’ll battle against people who’ve beaten me again and again. By doing that, we both grow a little as Trainers. 
I’m taking the Veilstone Gym challenge. But first... 
You made me lose my confidence... 
I think about Pokémon all day long. I was confident, you know. 
Oh, it’s you again! I’ve regained my confidence. Let’s have another battle! 
I’m a treasure hunter. Today, the loot is a victory from you! 
I can’t win. You’re too much to take! 
If one’s after treasures, maybe the Underground is the better choice. 
I’m a treasure hunter. This time, I will have my trophy: a victory from you! 
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace? 
My pace is completely off... 
Sticking to one’s own goal is more important than it seems. If you match your goal with someone else, you’ll lose your identity. 
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk. I even stop on occasion. I am human, after all. 
Up till now, I’d maintained my pace. But seeing you threw me off! 
                        
                              
                       
I’m an ace. I can see that you’re an ace, too! 
Just as I thought...
You can pretend to be ordinary, but your eyes tell me another story. 
A real ace doesn’t get hung up on getting wins. A real ace sets sights consistently higher to improve themselves. 
I always battle for keeps. This is no drill! 
Good job! That was an excellent battle. 
If you don’t play for keeps, you’ll lose battles you should be dominating. 
When I lost to you last time, I was battling for keeps. But this time, I really mean it. This is seriously for keeps! 
I’m fully kitted up and equipped! Anytime will be fine! 
Hunh?! 
Perhaps I should maybe change into a more comfy outfit... 
I’m fully equipped again today! Anytime you’re ready will be fine! 
To be ready to answer any call! To be ready to accept any challenge! That is the way of a Trainer! 
How disappointing... 
You can make all the preparations in the world, but if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. 
I got everything ready so we could have a rematch whenever you come. 
I’m skiing right now, but OK. As we Skiers say, “Spur thing!” 
...I’ve hit an ice patch! 
I quite enjoyed that battle! Let us meet again. Slalom! 
We might get snowbound, but why not? It’s on the “spur” of the moment! 
Are you a novice? Or are you capable? 
I never expected you to be an expert... 
You know how to play your Pokémon with an edge! 
Knowing you to be an expert, I challenge you to a rematch! 
What’s fun about winter? Number one, skiing! Number two, Pokémon! 
Snivel...
If it was skiing, I wouldn’t lose. I should go ski with my Pokémon... 
You’re a better Trainer than a skier. But I’ll challenge you again anyway! 
How do you expect to battle in this heavy snow? 
The winds of victory shifted... 
It’s so cold here, but here you are, dressed all lightly. I guess you kids are made tougher than people my age. 
Why would you wander around here? You must really like this area. 
I can withstand this cold. That means I can take any kind of attack! 
Huh? It’s over, you say? 
Oh, gosh, this is bad! I think I’m losing feeling all over my body! 
Oh? I’ve seen your face before. What say we battle? 
This cold is but nothing compared to the fire that burns in my heart! 
Your heart burns as hot as mine! 
The weather clears up sometimes. The view is breathtaking then. 
We’ll come at you with our hearts ablaze! 
Wh-what is it? P-Pokémon battle?! 
Whew... You are alive, aren’t you? 
Around these parts, perhaps because of all the snow, there are many folktales of hauntings... 
This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve trained since then! 
I’ll show you the techniques I had drummed into me at ski school! 
I don’t believe it... My techniques were rebuffed... 
I should have enrolled in a Pokémon Trainers’ school... 
Since I lost to you last time, I redid my training at ski school! 
We Skiers feel Mother Nature through the soles of our feet! 
I got a good taste of your power! 
Trainers get an appreciation of life through Pokémon. At least I think so. 
I knew you were headed here. I felt it with the soles of my feet! 
I’ve been skiing with Pokémon since I was just five years old. 
Oh, um, wait... What?! 
The scenery doesn’t change very much around here. Don’t go getting lost! 
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again? You should pay more attention! 
Rainy days make me feel blue... But the instant it starts to snow, I’m as happy as can be! 
The conditions weren’t very good. 
Can any of your Pokémon use that hidden move to climb cliffs? 
You really must like snow. After all, if you didn’t, I doubt that you’d come here so often! 
Poof! You’ve got a good eye spotting me! 
You also saw through my weak spots... 
I’ll play with my Pokémon--even in a blizzard! 
Poof! You saw through my camouflage again! 
There are several kinds of ninjas. Are you an Iga or a Kouga ninja? 
I’m not much of a ninja either way... 
I wonder why everyone stops being a ninja when they grow up? 
I forged my willpower in the snow! Witness my snowy might! 
To make sure I’m more agile, I always dress light! 
Achoo! 
I might have to go home and dress warmer than this... 
I’m sticking it out and staying lightly dressed! 
                              
       
                    
                                
         
                 
                                           
         
                          
                                    
            
                       
Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting! 
...
When nothing’s biting, the smart thing to do is just call it a day. 
Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting today either. 
                                   
     
                  
                                             
                                 
     
              
                
Outdoor fishing for the win! Shouting doesn’t help my fishing any, but shout I must! 
Gwaaah! This is hurting! 
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring away the Pokémon. 
Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn’t help! 
Let it rock! It’s the rhythm of battle! 
Can you hear it? That’s my guitar weeping... 
I’m too torn up to sing anymore... I am so cool that way... 
Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again! Our rhythm of battle! 
A man of the sea is also a man of Pokémon! 
Anchors away! 
You’ve got what it takes to be a Trainer among Trainers! 
Rudder hard to starboard! Hold on! Nobody go overboard! 
                 
                          
                               
                                         
              
                               
                      
       
                          
I love my inner tube. So I admire jellyfish Pokémon! 
I’m drifting away... 
I wish Professor Rowan would give me a Pokédex. But that old guy looks kind of scary. 
I love my inner tube. So I admire jellyfish Pokémon. Won’t you hang out with us and just bob around on the waves? 
I can’t swim without my floaty. But my Pokémon sure can! 
They weren’t tough, my Pokémon... 
My mommy said that Professor Rowan is really kindhearted.
Oh! You’re the Trainer who played with us before! Can you see if my Pokémon have grown stronger? 
I only live to swim. Teach me what’s so fun about Pokémon! 
Wow, that was fun! 
I’ll try swimming with Pokémon next. 
Yo! You’re that Trainer who taught me how fun Pokémon can be. Let’s have another battle, you and me! 
On your marks, get set... 
Owowowow! My leg cramped up! 
I forgot to do my stretching exercises... 
Hi, I was waiting for you! Ready? On your marks, get set... 
OK! Get your breathing in order! OK! You’re ready to go! 
I let my momentum falter... 
Listen, I have something important to say to you. Don’t drown in your own talent. 
OK! You’re ready to go! This time, I’m going for the win! 
Swimming is a full-body exercise. You should swim, too! 
Sunk like a stone! 
Well, Pokémon’s one thing, but you should take up swimming, too! 
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer! You should be swimming like me! 
The human body floats more easily in the sea, so it’s easy to swim! 
The water’s too salty! 
I’ve got that sinking feeling... 
Pokémon can stay afloat even while carrying someone. That’s so cool! 
I may not look it now, but I’m a star. I’m always with my Pokémon. 
I lost, but at least I had fun. 
If it were an underwater Pokémon show, I would have shined. 
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our Pokémon show again? 
I bought a new bikini! It’s this year’s newest model! 
Psssssh! 
I made a mistake buying this bikini... It’s a little too tight... 
Did I show you already? My bikini, new for this year! 
                              
                  
                             
                               
                     
              
                
                 
Well? Does it look like I’m swimming gracefully? 
I’m finally feeling fatigued... 
I may look like I’m swimming gracefully, but beneath the surface I’m kicking furiously. 
You were attracted by my graceful swimming again, weren’t you? 
Water-type Pokémon come in a great variety of shapes and sizes. I’ll show you the water Pokémon that I’ve picked for myself! 
I can’t boast when I lose... I’m so disappointed... 
Sure I lost, but watch me! I’ll get tougher with water Pokémon. 
This time, my water Pokémon will show you why I’m so proud of them! 
Hey. I like fishing. But my true love is battling! 
Sploosh! 
If you don’t know how to fish, you’re missing half of life’s enjoyment. If you don’t know Pokémon... You’re missing out on all of it! 
Come on, battle me again! You know I love to fish and battle! 
                                
        
                                   
People consider me an Ace Trainer. Let me demonstrate the skills that earned me that title! 
I’m burning with jealousy over your raw talent! 
I think keeping up the effort to better yourself is a talent in itself. 
Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to show you my skill. This time, I’ll show you why they consider me an ace! 
Oh? You intend to beat me? I am an ace, you know. 
I see... I have to concede defeat. 
To not be depressed by a loss... That’s one trait of an ace. 
Ace Trainers always work to improve their natural-born talents. 
You’re going to the Pal Park? It’s not right that you get to go before a Collector like me! 
You’re one enthusiastic Trainer. 
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of Pokémon you can see there? 
Listen, did you go to the Pal Park? What was it like? What was it like? 
I’m in the middle of fishing, but OK. I’ll be happy to sink you. 
Whooah!
The one that got away was a big one... 
Once I hook it, no fish gets away from me! A Trainer walking by also can’t get free of my clutches! 
Hi, traveler! How would you like to battle? 
You sure showed me up. 
I like to fish. You’re a traveler. Farewell, until we meet again! 
Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve battled before, haven’t we? 
I’m getting bored of fishing. Let’s have a quick battle! 
I’ve been done in... 
Thanks, Trainer. That was a good change of pace. 
Yo! I remember how our battle was a good change of pace before. Let’s have another quick battle! 
If I stare at the water’s surface for too long, I begin to forget what I was doing in the first place. 
I don’t know how, but I lost! 
Oh, right... I was fishing, wasn’t I? 
When I looked up from staring at the water’s surface, I saw your face. I’m not sure about what I was just doing, but do you want to battle? 
                    
    
                
                
      
                 
                                                                      
                       
                                                        
                                 
     
                               
It takes both brains and brawn when you’re out at sea. Aye, it’s not an easy job, the Sailor’s life! 
Glub, glub, glub!
If you were to become a Sailor, I’m sure you’d make a good one! 
I’ll beat you this time and convince you to become a Sailor! 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. Sing it! 
Your Pokémon... They’re looking good! 
You ought to think about becoming a Sailor yourself. It’s been great to be able to visit different places around the world. 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. You sing, too! 
Who’s there?! What do you think you’re doing?! 
I happen to be rather jumpy, so everyone looks suspicious to me. 
I’m easy to scare, and yet here I am on patrol. Funny how things go. 
At night, I get tense and nervous. I don’t know why. 
I’ll repeat myself! Who’s there?! What do you think you’re doing?! 
I’m quite bored. Care to break the monotony? 
The monotony was broken, but... 
I’ll go rest at the hotel. I’ve had quite enough of this. 
Ah, it’s you. I’m bored again. Care to break the monotony? 
                                 
            
                                  
                                
                       
                               
After enjoying a meal at the hotel restaurant, one has a battle. That’s the social etiquette. 
Enchanting. 
Personally, I would rather just play with Pokémon than battle with them. 
I only seem to run into you after I go to the restaurant. Etiquette calls for a battle after a meal. Shall we? 
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon! It’s really cool! 
Wowee! I had to hold on tight to my inner tube! 
Pools are OK, but I like the sea because Pokémon live there. 
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon again, right? Look, look! 
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what kind of Pokémon you have? 
You’re so tough. I’m stunned... 
I want to hang on to a BUIZEL and just bob around. 
Listen, listen! Did you find any new kinds of Pokémon? 
                          
           
                               
                            
                
                   
                                 
                 
                 
                  
                           
I came out here because I wanted to see the Pokémon League for myself. 
I’m shocked... No, really, I am. 
The way I battle now, well, I can only look at the Pokémon League! You, go on! You go to the Pokémon League for me, too! 
I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the Pokémon League. 
I’ve decided! If I can beat you, I’m going to the Pokémon League! 
Blblblblugh... 
It’s OK. Just let me float away like driftwood... 
I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m challenging the Pokémon League! 
It might not look like it, but I’m traveling now. 
You’ve got the upper hand on me. 
But you can be sure that there will be bigger challenges in front of you. Go! Go as far as you can! You alone can broaden your horizons. 
I’m still on my journey... Let’s have a battle! 
The sea around here is harsh. It’s made me just as harsh! 
The world is so harsh... 
What? You’ve got that many Gym Badges? No wonder you’re so tough... 
It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have toughened me up more! 
My dream is to swim in the sea in every region under the sun! 
Boo! I’m not done with my dream! 
I wonder what the seas are like in Kanto and Hoenn...? 
My new dream is to challenge all the Pokémon Leagues in every region! 
Yes, I know I can surf, but I’d rather swim instead. It does seem weird, I agree. 
Kaploosh! 
If you don’t know how, I’m willing to show you how to swim. 
If you rely on your Pokémon all the time, you’ll never learn how to swim! 
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too. Don’t think you’re going to win easily! 
Master Wake... I’m so sorry to have failed you... 
What to do... Train at the Gym again, or train by myself... 
I trained at the Gym after you beat me. Let’s do it, gang! 
I’m determined to go to the Pokémon League, no matter how hard it is. 
Th-this is so hard... 
Losing won’t make me give up. The Pokémon League isn’t going anywhere. 
It doesn’t matter how long it takes, I’m going to the Pokémon League! 
Excuse me for wearing my bikini! 
Was I multitasking too much, battling and swimming at the same time? 
When I’m in my bikini, I’m at a loss about where to carry my Poké Balls! 
Giggle... Excuse me for wearing my bikini! 
Deep breathing before battle! 
Inhale... Exhale...
Deep breathing after battle, too! 
Don’t get careless, even if you’re facing someone familiar. Do your deep-breathing exercises... 
Your Pokémon isn’t tired, even though it’s carrying you on its back. Let me see how strong that Pokémon is, OK? 
I’ve had my fill... 
I’m tired of swimming, so I’ll just float around and get some rest. 
How much stronger have your Pokémon become? Let me check ’em out, OK? 
Did you know, I was crowned the champion of a swimsuit contest! So now, I’m trying to win a title at a Pokémon Contest! 
I’ve been sunk! 
I’ll need to rework my strategy! 
I became the champion of a swimsuit contest... I’m a super-talented girl! I’m challenging you so I can become the champ of a Pokémon Contest! 
My favorite kind of guy is someone that looks good out on the open sea! 
The tide is going out... 
...Though there’s a mysterious nature that surrounds a mountain man... 
Hello again! You’re that Trainer who looks keen with your Pokémon! 
Fine, all righty then. Just a quick battle on my break! 
Wahaha! Mercy, I cry mercy! 
I’d better get on back to work... You know, I’d rather be traveling around with Pokémon the way you do. 
I’m gonna let you in on a secret... I snuck my Pokémon to work! 
Well, now aren’t you something! 
OK, OK, time for work! I’ll work up a thirst with my Pokémon! 
                           
              
                 
                           
                
                           
                                 
           
                               
                                                
                          
                         
What’s cool, you might ask? No? I’ll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon! 
It bugs me when people ignore the awesome coolness of bug Pokémon! 
It would seem that coolness alone doesn’t add up to any wins... 
Here comes the swarm! 
Whoooh... 
Did you know? “Swarm” is the name of a Pokémon ability. 
My senses tingle... I’ve spotted a rare Pokémon! 
Awawawawah... 
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but it turned out to be just a Trainer! 
We’re just out on a power walk! 
Oh, you! 
Eewww, nasty! There are only bug Pokémon in the forest... I also forgot to buy some Antidotes. It’s just the worst thing ever! 
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond as one, a wondrous power is born... 
Hmm... 
There still remain many mysteries yet to be solved in this strange world... 
A strange presence has been felt... It is emanating from...you! 
Oh! Be one with me, my MEDITITE!
The Old Chateau... I sense... a particularly strong presence there.
I see it... I see it... I see you going down in defeat... 
It is I that has gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau...lies abandoned, with none living in its walls... And yet, and yet, there permeates a presence...
This forest is strange, you know... It seems to fill me with energy... 
Your victory... There is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem to gather such unexplainable energy.
                         
               
                               
                                  
                            
                 
                             
                                  
                        
                 
                                                
                  
                 
                                           
                              
               
                                 
                             
            
                   
                                
                
                            
                                             
                
                
                                 
            
                        
                                       
               
                                 
                                                 
                  
                      
                           
        
                                   
                                               
               
                                   
                                                           
              
                                
                  
               
                            
                  
             
                          
                             
    
            
                                   
              
                                        
                         
                             
               
               
                  
You... One look at you tells me you’re a real contender! 
You’re as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other side of the road when I walk by ’em. It’s a goal of mine I’m working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as if my journey is now coming to an end. But, before the final chapter is written, I must pen your defeat! 
That wasn’t how I planned the final chapter to go in my writing class...
If you don’t give up, you can reach your goal. That perseverance is what’s important to Trainers. That’s in my book, too.
Show me how you’ve battled to get here! Let’s do this! 
So, that’s how you battled...? 
Once you emerge from Victory Road, the Pokémon League lies directly ahead... But many Trainers fail to ever find their way on Victory Road... 
This total stranger’ll be a good way to see if I have what it takes to own the Pokémon League’s Elite Four! 
That battle just now must make you tougher than everyone in the world. 
It doesn’t appear as if anyone could even try to stand against your might. The Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have a lot of trust in you. You and your Pokémon... You seem to be aglow. 
Ah, I understand it now! 
You blaze with so much vitality! 
Let me take a measure of how much you have raised your Pokémon! 
Brilliant! 
Rather than navigating Victory Road, I have a much better time putting young Trainers like you to the test. 
I’m making an already-strong Pokémon grow even stronger. I’ll need your help with this! 
There’s no way I could have won! 
Now how am I gonna teach it the most powerful dragon moves...? Well? 
Top-level Trainers gather around this place naturally. I’d go so far as to call it the ideal place to train with the best! 
That’s why I like it here; I get to battle tough characters like you. 
When two roads diverge, you must choose the path less traveled... 
My Pokémon knows karate! I’m warning you, it’s a tough one! 
I’ve met my match in strength! 
I’ve made it this far in life using the karate I learned on the Internet! 
I keep battling so I can soar ever higher into the skies! 
It seems I’ve been grounded... 
The wings of freedom... I know I’ll find them if I can win my way through the Pokémon League... 
Be warned, mortal! I can see the future! 
So be it! I will now divulge what I know of your future... Hmm! 
In the Pokémon League ahead, the Elite Four await you! But, you knew that already. 
I can see the past! 
There’s just so much in your past... 
Did you... Did you meet a legendary Pokémon? No. That can’t be right... 
Pat: It’s a doubles team of aces! We’re gonna overwhelm you! 
Pat: You and your Pokémon will gain power by helping each other out. 
Pat: The combination of you and your awesome Pokémon... It’s the ultimate tag team! 
Pat: If you don’t mind, we’re hoping for some two-on-two battle action. 
Jo: We form a combination that’s in perfect sync! How do you expect to counter that? 
Jo: You and your Pokémon make a beautiful combination! 
Jo: Yup, the way you battle is fantastic! You should try to take the Elite Four right now--not later! 
Jo: We want to have a battle without an advantage. Please come back when you have at least two Pokémon! 
Al: I intend to perfect my Double Battle technique. That will make me better all around. 
Al: You! You’re an expert double battler, too! 
Al: Your mastery over several Pokémon at once... You’re a remarkable Trainer! 
Al: You have but one Pokémon? I would say that you are taking Victory Road too lightly, kid. 
Kay: I want to improve my doubles technique as much as I can. That will improve me as a Trainer. 
Kay: My goodness! You’re great at doubles, too!
Kay: Depending on the combinations, every kind of Pokémon can excel. At least, that’s what I think. 
Kay: You’re really going through Victory Road with only one Pokémon? 
We Trainers will accept challenges anywhere! It’s what we do. 
Hmm... Insufficiently raised? 
Gee... When you’re in a cave, wild Pokémon can appear anytime! 
To celebrate my getting through this cave, I’m going to battle you! 
Well, I guess losing is something to commemorate, too... 
Getting through that cave feels like an adventure. 
I’m a Veteran, yes, but don’t you dare treat me like a senior citizen! 
Hnuuurgh... So much skill for one so young! 
I’ll always remain young at heart. Never let them say you’re too old! 
                                                       
          
                        
                                         
              
                                        
                         
               
               
Oh, what’s this? My last one! This is where we make our stand! 
We’re not done yet! There’s no giving up! 
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated! 
Aiyaah! We’re coming out swinging with super-heavy judo chops! 
That was... A complete trashing! 
I must rededicate myself to training. The road extends into infinity... 
Up and down you go on the lifts. Me? I like to battle! 
You’ve got me feeling down! 
I can’t keep this up! I’ll go back to working on the lifts. 
A Pokémon Gym isn’t only about seeing how tough your Pokémon happen to be. It’s so much deeper than just that. It’s a test of you as a person. 
That move was devastating! 
I get to work all day with my Pokémon, and even battle sometimes. I get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and experience of battling at high levels. I’ll demonstrate what that means to a noob like you! 
Wow... I’m in the mood to sing a lullaby... 
Your earnest enthusiasm... I guess that kinda makes you an ace. Maybe you’re a Trainer who has the potential to surpass aces! 
By focusing on only one type, you can really see the strengths and weaknesses of that Pokémon. 
My focus was too narrow minded...
Start by becoming friendly with your Pokémon. I mean really friendly. If you do that, you’ll learn naturally how you should battle with it. 
Steel represents an unbending spirit! If one refuses to accept defeat, the path to victory reveals itself! 
I never gave up, but still I failed to win... 
If you give up, well, that’s when everything ends for you! 
Pokémon and people have worked together for many years. Let us show you an example of that history! 
A spectacular loss! But it’s still a loss! 
The way you helped each other... That is what made you prevail! 
What do you think you’re doing to my Pokémon?!
This can’t be?! I lost?! You...you uppity brat! 
I ain’t fooling around, kid. This is how a professional does it! 
You messed up my job... Now I’m not gonna get a bonus... 
I hear they’re going to do something with electricity, I think. 
Collecting electricity from the Valley Windworks... That’s our mission. 
I really don’t like kids who also happen to be tough Trainers... 
You don’t have an inkling of what Team Galactic is trying to achieve! Of course, they don’t tell a grunt like me anything, either... But still! 
...This is why I’m gonna be stuck as a grunt forever... 
...If only I had some decent Pokémon... 
Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet! 
My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a close fight. 
What just happened? I lost?! 
Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet! 
My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a close fight. 
What just happened? I lost?! 
We were having a heated discussion over Pokémon the way Collectors do. 
Knowledge alone isn’t everything, you know... 
I’m more knowledgeable than the rest when it comes to collecting. I have rare Pokémon! But a Collector doesn’t make a good battler necessarily... 
I’m a Collector, and I’m proud of what I know about Pokémon. Would you like me to test your knowledge? 
That’s some knowledge you have there! 
I don’t like people who are more knowledgeable than me! Go away! 
Welcome! This place is my pride and joy! 
I take losses with an unusually big smile! Do you find that odd at all? 
After a match, you should have some Moomoo Milk to quench your thirst! Just chug it right down! Glug glug! 
                                                                   
                   
                              
                                                                
                   
                                 
                                                                  
                   
                                   
                            
                 
                   
                                 
                   
                 
It’s not the end yet.
Are you saying something? You think you have me cornered? 
Amazing! You’re very good, aren’t you? 
Giggle! You found me! Of course, let’s battle! 
Aww, boo! Look, you’ve beaten me! 
Giggle! There’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on, don’t be afraid! 
A forest inside a Gym... Shocking, isn’t it? 
I was going to beat you while you were still in a state of shock... 
OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past two boulders. 
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out special attacks... I won’t let you win easily! 
The more beautiful a flower, the faster it withers... 
Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer... In the middle of three trees. That’s my hint. Good luck. 
Even concealed, there is no hiding the aroma of flowers. 
Just like your inability to conceal your abundant skill. 
Your next opponent is under four flowers. 
Hey! That there! That was a good move! 
This is where it gets exciting! 
Hunwah! It’s gone and ended! How will I say this... I want more! I wanted to battle a lot more! 
I’ve landed the most fish Pokémon in the world. I’m next! 
Being number one in the world doesn’t mean a thing... 
I figure I got too wrapped up in fishing and neglected training. 
I have mastery over the incredible power of water. You won’t win! 
But the kid wins anyway! I’m just bowled over! 
The water rising and falling is tricky, but don’t let it annoy you. If you lose sight of yourself, that’s when you’re set to lose. 
I’ve traveled all over the globe while raising Pokémon. This is the Gym I’ve chosen. You’ll find it a handful for sure! 
You! You’re a kind of top-class tough! 
If you were to go around the world, I’m sure you’d meet tougher Pokémon. 
Like the raging sea, I crash down and wash away everything before me! That’s just how I roll! 
That wave didn’t even wash my hands... 
I’m now becalmed like a waveless sea... 
My body isn’t the only thing I work on toughening up here. I also work on my Pokémon and my spirit! 
Wow, Trainer! You just might be tougher than our Gym Leader! 
Maybe I’ll do like Wake, I mean, Crasher Wake, and wear the same kind of mask. 
I want to become a strong Trainer like Crasher Wake! 
Groan... You’re too much. 
Maybe I’ll do like Wake, I mean, Crasher Wake, and use the same kinds of Pokémon. 
                                              
                     
                           
                                
      
                                  
                                                              
                           
                              
                                  
                      
                                 
Oh! But this isn’t the end, my friend! 
I’m in a bit of a bind, aren’t I? 
I shall admit defeat... You are much too strong. 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for love with my fist! Hiyah, looooooooove! 
Argh! Crunched! 
Your Pokémon sure are tough! But our Gym Leader Maylene will break you like a stack of bricks! 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for courage with my fist! Hiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage! 
I couldn’t force my way to victory... 
To overwhelm by force... That is my ideal beat-down style. It doesn’t seem to work that way with Pokémon, however. 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for hope with my fist! Hiyah, hoooooooooooooope! 
We came up short, but not by much. 
I’ll have to redo my training, though. Maylene’s gonna trample me again... 
We’re the Karate Quads! I will strike a blow for tears with my fist! Hiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars! 
I’m so hungry, kid... I don’t have any strength left... 
I lost because I didn’t eat enough pizza. ...No. Anything I say will sound like I’m making excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this? Is this my final Pokémon? 
Never give up, never surrender! 
You are so fantastically strong. I know now why I have lost. 
I’ve been to all sorts of places. That means I know tons of things! 
Yeah, whatever. You can battle, too... 
I’m gonna visit new places and find new Pokémon so I’ll be a know-it-all! 
Seriously, kid, why don’t you answer the quiz properly? You could get to the Gym Leader without a problem! Waste of my time. Now I gotta knock you around a bit. 
I kinda deserved that, didn’t I? I gotta stop mouthing off like that... 
I’ll remember you and your shifty Pokémon, too. I’m watching you... 
Ooh, ooh! You want to battle me? OK then, I’ll do the best I can! 
I squeezed out all my power... You’re one impressive challenger. 
Look at it this way: you can learn something from every battle. 
Ehehe! You threw the quiz so you’d get to battle with me, right? 
Don’t you know how to take it easy or anything? Geesh! 
Since you’re here, you might as well take on every Trainer. 
I’m not afraid of picnicking anywhere, so I’ve learned all sorts of things. 
Your toughness... It’s something new to me.
I’ve learned that Pokémon are fun ’cause everyone plays with ’em! 
I study subjects like Pokémon and history... You know, all the important things! 
Oh, what in the...? I didn’t study enough? 
You won because of Pokémon type matchups, cool tactics... You know, all sorts of reasons!
I’ve probably studied more about Pokémon than you. 
Oh, you! I feel bad that I’m so angry! 
I’m going over the reasons why I lost. That way, I’ll win next time. 
Don’t you have a Pokétch? Or did you screw up deliberately? 
Gwaah! I was done in! 
You’ll have to turn back, though. This is a dead end. 
I’m going to break the ice and bring out my last-resort Pokémon! 
I can sense your will to win, but I promise you I’m not about to lose! 
I must say, I’ve warmed up to you! I might even admire you a little. 
...It’s t-too cold. I can’t even feel my t-tongue. 
This result... ...It’s cold. Bitter cold. 
The higher up you slide from, the more speed you’ll have to smash those big snowballs. 
My willpower was shaped and tempered by howling blizzards. I’ll bring it to bear on you! 
You weren’t even fazed... 
I’ve battled countless Trainers and many more Pokémon still. My spirit has been hardened from all the battles I have fared.
Is the Gym’s trick floor making you a little hot under the collar? If you can’t maintain your cool in battle, you’ll freeze up. 
You were surprisingly cool... At least I have my warm boots. 
Your Pokémon look so hot in battle. So hot, they’re cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling the chill of fatigue? A good Trainer goes for the win no matter what their condition is! 
That’s right. A good Trainer will win, no matter what the situation may be. 
The Trainer’s feelings... The Pokémon’s feelings... If they are one and the same, you will never lose. 
                                 
                     
                           
                                             
         
                                                                   
Here it comes! Get ready for my trump card! 
Shocking... I didn’t see this coming! 
You’ve got me beat... Your desire and the noble way your Pokémon battled for you... I even felt thrilled during our match. That was a very good battle. 
Wow! I’m surprised you’ve come this far, but you’ll have to turn back. There isn’t any chance that you could ever beat me! 
What makes your Pokémon so special? 
As a challenger, you’re one tough Trainer. 
I’m not just looking for tough Trainers to battle. I’ve been battling here because I want to feel the rush! 
Your power is thrilling... I’m thrilled down to my toes! 
I’m so glad that there are Pokémon! There isn’t much else that gives me the thrill that Pokémon do! 
I want to win! I channel that desire through my guitar! I want to win! That desire makes my Pokémon a star! 
We couldn’t win... No encores for us... 
The Trainer’s desire to win! If you don’t lose that, there’s no limit on what you can become! 
Spark! This is what our Gym Leader did to the Gym out of boredom! 
Spark... 
We were lacking energy... No, we lacked more than that. We didn’t want the win enough. 
Whether you’re a Trainer or a Guitarist, it takes dedication to improve your mad skills! 
My skills seem to have let me down. I must have been out of tune! 
The way you battle, I can feel the very heart of rock and roll. Tell me, are you maybe a fan of rocking out? 
Look at the way I’m dressed. Can’t you see that I’m hardcore? 
I was being serious! Don’t laugh at me! I mean it! 
I dress this way so I can learn to think like an electric Pokémon. Why don’t you give it a try? 
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh. That’s why I’m here--to learn the best battle techniques around! 
...You’re tough. 
You just showed me that there’s still lots I need to learn. The world of Pokémon is deep! 
Can you make it to the Gym Leader? You sure now? 
The gears spin round and round... I spin down and out... 
Our Gym’s trick walkways are sure to make your head spin! 
My dragon Pokémon chose to become powerful here. They sure like it! 
Your battle style... So savage... 
It’s been several years since I left the Dragon’s Den. I’ve got to say, your Pokémon are in the top class for toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to become powerful. 
There’s something about you... You’re not just anybody. I challenge you! 
You’re at a different level of expertise for sure! 
You’ve won countless times... That has made you very powerful. 
There’s something about you... You still remain extraordinary. I challenge you again! 
I constantly analyze Pokémon and various battles on my laptop. 
...Things don’t always work out according to my calculations... 
I had a lot of fun battling with you, though. I wonder if I can analyze the battle data properly? I could use a rematch to get some additional data. 
I analyzed our last battle on my laptop. 
For some reason I was drawn here, and it is here that I met you... I want to know what all this means! 
I see... So that’s what it means... 
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic presence emanating from here... 
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to know what all this means! 
There is nothing here... And yet there is a power lurking... Were you drawn by it, as well? 
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather marvelous indeed... 
A place where nothing else exists... A place such as that is better suited to awaken the power within. 
Do you see now? You’ve come back again. There must be something that draws you to this place... 
I don’t care who you are--no one interferes with my treasure hunting! 
My treasure! My Pokémon! 
I heard there’s an intriguing stone monument around, so I came running. 
I’m still here...and still searching for treasures. However, a battle with you is a treasure I can’t pass up! 
A man standing alone, I face the sea and train. These fists were hewn in that way! 
My training and my fists weren’t enough to defeat you!
Argh! Instead of training myself, I should have trained my Pokémon! All I’ve been doing for the last year is staring out over the sea! 
Ah, it’s been a long time! I have been toughening my fists against the sea, just as before! 
I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more Pokémon! So, what kind of a Trainer are you? 
I see... Simply outstanding.
I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more Pokémon. You’re a strong Trainer. Moreover, your heart is strong. 
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an excuse to slack off. I take pride in challenging those who have bested me before! 
Oh snap! That’s how it is, then? 
I like to study a lot... I thought I could win... 
If you can beat me, I’ll let you join my fan club so you can adore me! 
Ouch! Are you one of those crazy fans? You sure are rowdy! 
Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! Thank you for being such a fan! Just so you know, our latest single is “Pokémon for World Peace”! 
I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! We just might have a scoop here! 
My camera’s too heavy. I couldn’t battle effectively... 
The lively expressions on you and your Pokémon’s faces... It sure makes for some great TV! 
Your spirit’s vibes, man... I can feel that you’ve got rock in your soul! 
You beat me, man, but... I feel totally amped to jam harder! 
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit, too! That’s why battles rock! Rawk! 
You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK? 
The camera is our witness! It’s recorded our defeat... 
I’d like to take that footage and have it broadcast worldwide. 
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d have a great scene to shoot! 
So, let’s begin and find out what sort of a Trainer you are! 
You have a superstar quality! You sure could become a celebrity! 
I lost, but I’m totally thrilled! We just made some great TV! 
Oh, no. What we’re looking for is you in action with two Pokémon! 
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am! Aren’t you having fun?! Let’s make it fun! OK?! Mwahahah! 
Oh, no, no, no! Mwahahah? 
A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while laughing. Mwahahah! It defines what we do! 
Po-Po-Pokémon! Do you think I’m a real Pokémon? 
Pi-pikachu! 
I need to find a way to get more into the character of a Pokémon... 
Join me in this on-the-spot report, live at the scene of a battle! 
The media is the victim! 
Interviews are about taking the initiative. The people need to know. 
How is this madness possible? The two of us, losing to children? 
This won’t do... Time to retreat. This mission is a failure. 
How insolent. Take a bite of this, child! 
Losing to some child... Being careless cost me too much. 
We are gathering Pokémon for an astonishing undertaking! Your meddling won’t be tolerated! 
I feel like I got meddled with... 
Our astonishing undertaking is most certainly breathtaking. If you ever hope to see its glorious unveiling, then don’t meddle with us! 
                           
             
                                                       
Our objectives are incredible! Too incredible for me to understand! I’ll fight blindly to defend them, and your intrusion won’t be forgiven! 
What was I fighting for, again?
What do you have against taking Pokémon from others? Look in any field or forest! Those things aren’t exactly rare! 
                       
                         
                                                
Sorry, deary! Team Galactic doesn’t accept children as members! 
B-but, deary, you’re just a kid! 
You wanted to go up? Well, why didn’t you? 
Let’s see how good this Pokémon is! I stole it from some weak Trainer. 
What is this?! 
Wimpy little Pokémon... When I get promoted, I’ll demand better stolen Pokémon. 
Why, thank you! We love it when people come to us to donate their Pokémon! 
What do you think you’re doing?! 
You can catch Pokémon anywhere. What’s so special about them? Trainers that lose theirs should quit whining and catch some more! 
                                               
             
                                                                      
This place is teeming with UNOWN... There has to be some meaning to this. The truth is out there... I’ll start my search by battling you! 
The search must continue! 
I give up. I’m not going to rack my brain over the meaning of this place. 
I can’t explain it... Being here compels me to battle! 
Hunh?! What was I just doing?! 
Though they are gone, their desire to battle lives on? The spirits of Pokémon still linger? Is that what it is? 
I need to shake off my sorrow... Please, battle with me! 
My sorrow has deepened... 
I won’t ever forget the time I spent with my Pokémon... Not even for a moment. 
It makes no difference where we are. If you have Pokémon with you, I reckon you ought to battle. 
You’ve got a lot of giddyap and go in you! 
Over a long life, you’ll be certain to have some sad farewells. But I reckon there are also some new beginnings. 
Hahaha! I’m afraid y’all are no match for us with jus’ one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one. Lemme show you how much! 
Well! Aren’t you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower... Right’n here, inside my heart... Those are the places where my Pokémon remain... 
You haven’t got yerself two Pokémon? 
My Pokémon were taken from me... Team Galactic did it... Ever since, I’ve never forgiven their faces... 
Gwaaaaaah! 
I’m not doing my Pokémon any favors by ruining its memory like this... I can’t be wallowing around forever. I gotta move on and turn the page.
Mike: I can’t embarrass myself again. Not in front of my girlfriend! 
Mike: Awww, jeez. Man, that’s a downer... 
Mike: Coming here again brings back all kinds of memories of me and Nat. 
Mike: You can’t battle with us. Not with one Pokémon, anyway. 
Nat: I don’t want to look bad again. Not when my boyfriend is watching! 
Nat: This makes me feel hollow inside... Oh, so hollow... 
Nat: The Pokémon that brought me and Mike together is buried here... 
Nat: You do have at least two Pokémon, don’t you? 
Waah! Ghost! Get away! Eek! Help me, team! 
Hey... You’re no ghost... 
I had to come here because I lost a dare with some kids at school. The loser had to go to the top and bring back an HM... 
Beating you would be my 100th straight win! Here’s to a fun battle! 
You don’t know how frustrating it is to lose now, after all that work! 
I wish I could beat Maylene in Veilstone City one day... 
Yeah, I like to camp! So what? Let’s battle! 
I should’ve just stuck to camping out here... 
When I’m with my Pokémon, I can camp just about anywhere I want! 
If we battle here, your Pokémon will become stronger, and so will mine. That’s a good thing for both of us. What’s not to like? Let’s throw down! 
You know, I would have really enjoyed a win there. Would’ve been real nice. 
This mine’s been abandoned, but now it’s home to many Pokémon. I guess everything finds a place to call home someday...
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers... You tell me, where else can I find a place as good as this to train? 
That was good. You’ve bonded well with your Pokémon. 
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers... A strong spirit and a tight bond... There is so much to train for. 
I’ll pound the fear of my fists into you all karate style, punk! 
I’m so sorry... I got a bit mouthy there, didn’t I? 
So, I’m gonna try and shatter steel! I wonder how many more years it would take for me to do that? 
Every good Hiker gets a boost of energy when surrounded by boulders! Wrooooar! Coming at you! Let me blow off some steam! 
Whew... Crazy, delicious sugar! I think I’ve calmed down now... 
If it’s called a mountain, you can be sure I’ll be climbing it. Even if it’s a mountain of food, I’ll still be stickin’ my flag on top! 
When you’re up in the mountains, a battle’d do for a proper greeting! 
Yahoo! 
Actually, when you’re up in the mountains, a simple hi’d do if you walk past someone. Oh, and this isn’t the mountains. 
May we have a battle, please? It will be something to lighten up this boring picnic with. 
We’re not going to win if we play around like that... 
I’m going home to play with my Pokémon! 
The working-class hero says hi! 
The working-class hero waves bye... 
I used to work here a long time ago, before it shut down. I worked at the ironworks near Floaroma Town, too. You might say I’m drawn by iron as if by magnet! 
While I’m making sure the lifts are safe, I’ll focus on a battle with you! 
A-OK! Looks safe to me! Not a problem in sight! 
I routinely check the lifts here. You can be sure of their safety! 
Hey! This is no playground! If you’re gonna play, battle me! 
You played me like an amateur! 
They were going to close this place up so no one could get in. But, they left it open so people and Pokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place as their training grounds. 
Maybe I should head to the Gym and work out there... 
Roark spent his childhood playing here, I think... 
Humph! You’re lost, aren’t you? I’ll guide you if you can beat me. 
I said I’m going to win! 
I’m not lost, I tell you! I’m camping! That’s my story! 
Huh? Are you lost too? No? It doesn’t matter. Let’s have a quick Pokémon battle! 
Not fair! We’re not on the same level! 
I got separated from my friends... I’ve got my Pokémon with me, so I’m OK, but... 
You look like you might just have the Pokémon I’ve been looking for! 
You didn’t have a single Pokémon I wanted... You’re no Collector! 
I’m very picky, so I want to collect every Pokémon without anyone’s help. ...I do have friends, though. No, seriously! I do! 
In deep tunnels and caves, there’re a couple things you’re sure to see. ZUBAT and Ruin Maniacs! 
Your awesome power... It’s mystifying. 
I’ve scoured every inch of this place... Most of it while I was lost. Anyway, if there’s one thing I can say, this place can’t be called ruins! 
Hush now, lost little Pokémon, don’t you cry. I’m here to take care of you! 
Sniffle... W-who’s crying now? 
Speaking of crying, I’m positive I heard crying from deeper in the cave. 
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave! 
I strayed from the battle plan! 
Me? No, I’m not lost. I live here! 
Wandering around, I got hungry, so I ate some wild mushrooms... They gave me gas, and now I can’t stop burping! Bluurrf! 
Bleff! Hurk! I think...I’m getting better... 
I hear there’s a Pokémon that has mushrooms growing on its back. Not around here, somewhere far away. I wonder if they taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you? Are you a Pokémon Trainer? 
OK, so we’re both Trainers. That’s a start, right? 
I just wanted to have a picnic under the Cycling Road. I didn’t think I would get lost in a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a cute setting, good food, and a fun battle! 
That wasn’t any fun for me! 
Why have a picnic here? I don’t know. There’s no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too? Wanna play battle with me? 
You were just toying with me!
I’m playing hide-and-seek here. I like some underground tag, too. 
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon will see through your weaknesses! 
Don’t you have an Achilles’ heel?
I want to become stronger, but only with my favorite Pokémon. 
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon is the shortcut to getting tough. 
I lost? But how is that possible?! 
Being able to manage any kind of Pokémon... I suppose that makes a good Trainer. 
Being this tough isn’t good enough. You have to look cool while doing it. Mastering that makes you an ace! 
Made me look bad... 
I battled the best I could. I wasn’t uncool in losing! ...Right? 
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of the sweetness that is victory. I can’t afford to lose this one! 
This defeat has the tang of my bitter tears...
I feel sorry for my hungry Pokémon... Sorry, guys. I’ll get tougher so you can feast on the taste of victory... 
I will win. I am sure of it. Therefore, you will lose! 
But... This isn’t possible! 
You didn’t win! I just lost! Oh, whatever. It’s the same thing... 
Let me see what you got there, kid. I could give you some advice. 
You got way too much! 
Well, I don’t have any advice for someone as tough as you! 
Now we shall battle, and from it will emerge one loser... 
...! 
I can use psychic powers, but battling isn’t so simple... It takes much more to win! 
A battle is a clash of willpower! The one who wants the win the most will emerge the victor! 
But... I thought I could win! 
Psychic power... It’s hard to put faith in something that you can’t see... 
Allow me to demonstrate how a true Psychic conducts a battle! 
Did I get to show you anything...? Anything at all? 
How do I use my psychic powers? I never use them for dishonest ends. I also never do any good deeds...
I see it! I see a victory for me! 
The future...is different! Why?! 
Your efforts have altered the very path of the future! 
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon at the Fighting Dojo in Kanto! 
Totally done for! 
We’re gonna go ahead and leave... You know, go train elsewhere. 
Judo chop! Pokémon battle! 
Wrroar! Judo chop defeated!
I’ll forget that we lost! ...Wait, if I did that, we’d never learn from our mistakes... 
What it means to battle... Its joys, its sorrows... I’ve experienced it all! 
My sorrow deepens... 
You may be a child, but you’ve taught me a whole lot. I thank you humbly. 
I’ll wheel out some wicked Pokémon and even wickeder moves! 
All I can manage now is to wheeze out a few meek sighs... 
I don’t see what my age has to do with playing with Pokémon, frankly. 
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to wherever. And so, here I am! 
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place, and it turns out to be the Battle Zone... 
I was born in the Hoenn region. I’ve only just recently flown here. 
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so, we train here daily! 
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of Mother Nature. They’re tough! 
How could you be tougher than Mother Nature? 
Most of the time, my Pokémon return to their Poké Balls right away. But sometimes, they just fall asleep on top of my head. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be evident in every Trainer! 
The potential of dragon Pokémon puts them at the top of my list! 
Potential doesn’t mean I can win... 
A Dragon Tamer Champion... I’ll need to train so much more to even come close to coming close... 
I’ve cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s potential! I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again! 
What my Pokémon and I most want... Victory! 
Arrrgh! My GYARADOS... 
I don’t ever want to put my Pokémon through that again... It got humiliated because I wasn’t good enough...
You’ve beaten us once before, but we won’t make the same mistake! 
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings... That’s what my master taught me. And now I’ll prove it to you! 
Not good enough! We’re still not strong enough! 
It’s not good enough for a Pokémon to just be tough. It’s not good enough for a Trainer to just work hard. Both have to grow together!
This time! I’ll show you how brilliantly I work with my Pokémon partner! 
How do you do? I’m a Dragon Tamer. What say we compare our Pokémon by means of a battle? 
Oops! How very silly of me! 
Well, there seems to be an image associated with Dragon Tamers. But personally, I’m really laid back and easygoing, you know? I figure there’s a whole lot of other things I need to worry about first. 
Heya, how do you do again? What say we let our Pokémon duke it out in another battle? 
There is something missing in the way I battle... I’ve come here to find it. 
I see it now... I know what I lack. 
It’s been a privilege to have battled with you. I learned an invaluable lesson from you today. 
Have you discovered what’s missing in your battles? I have. 
I’ve got the urge to battle with you. Hope you’re willing to oblige! 
I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge... 
So long as my partner’s alongside me, I’m willing to take on the world! 
The urge to battle you again has struck me. Want to humor me? 
Have you any knowledge of levels or the stats of Pokémon? Well, I do! 
Hmm. I like how you attack. 
Pokémon and numbers... Who cares about that stuff? Winning is what’s important. Numbers aren’t everything. 
Pokémon battles aren’t decided by numbers. It’s the bond you share with your Pokémon that decides outcomes! 
Welcome to my Pokémon show! 
Did you enjoy the show? Super fabulous, wasn’t it? 
I’ll be happy to battle you again! Let’s battle again sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show! 
My team’s been trained through and through! You’ll shake when you see how tough they are! 
I’m sh-sh-shaking all over... 
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos... You name it, I pumped ’em full of it. 
Hey! You’re that Trainer who left me all shook up! Uh-huh! This time, it’s my turn to leave you shaking all over! 
I’ve leveled my precious partner this far. I’ll let you see it! 
It needs to be leveled more?! 
My Pokémon... It’s actually the very first friend that I’ve ever had. 
...When I close my eyes, I’m taken back to that time we lost to you. My partner’s leveled since then. I’ll prove it to you! 
Worthy opponents... The search for them drives me to travel far. 
I’ve certainly found a tough adversary in you... 
How much you believe in your Pokémon... That’s a critical factor in how a battle will turn out. 
We’ve faced many challengers since we met, but they were all weak... I relish the tough resistance that only you can provide! 
Please don’t hold anything back. 
Hmm... 
I feel invigorated from that battle, even though we lost. After all, we gave it everything we had.
Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back--just like before. 
You’re willing to battle? Let me see what you have? 
Your love of Pokémon really shows! 
I grew up together with my team, right from my childhood. All our memories, we’ve always shared them. 
Oh, hi, we meet again. May I see what you’ve done with your Pokémon? 
The world is huge, and there are so many different Pokémon! What kinds of Pokémon are with you? Please, I want to have a look! 
Wow, there are Pokémon that wonderful! 
There is always something to like about any Pokémon. It’s so hard to decide which ones I should raise. 
If I’m having trouble deciding, I go with my favorites! 
What sort of moves have you taught? That tells me how good you are! 
Yowch! 
I heard that somewhere there’s someone who teaches Pokémon moves. 
Have you taught your team any new moves since last time? 
When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts! 
You won’t let me win? 
I suddenly remembered what it was  like when I had my first battle. I wonder why that would be? 
When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts! That’s what makes us Trainers! 
You’re going to win! That’s the future I saw! 
What I saw in the future turned out to be true... 
I lost, but my vision of the future came true... 
You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw! 
Right after this, you will send out Pokémon to battle me! 
Right after this, I have to pay out your prize money... 
What will happen to you after this? Why don’t you do just as you like? It would be more fun that way. 
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an astonishingly cool way! 
My quest for power brought me here. It was beneath the desert sand that I toughened my body and soul. Accept my challenge! Uraah! 
My spirit is broken... 
I thought I couldn’t win before it became a fact... I’ve let down my Pokémon... They go to battle with faith in their Trainer...
This time! This time I will win! My spirit is renewed and strong! 
I have meditated under a waterfall to temper my spirit. Allow me to demonstrate its strength! 
Ha-choo! Sniffle... 
All that time under the waterfall... Seems I’ve caught a cold. 
Since the day I lost to you, I’ve meditated under a waterfall! 
People! Nature! Pokémon! Harmony is essential! 
You’re A-OK! 
Protecting Pokémon and nature. Think of what that means. 
Do you remember my slogan? People! Nature! Pokémon! That’s right, harmony is essential! 
I work to protect beautiful, natural environments. My Pokémon are my constant companions while I work. 
Oh, my gosh! My poor Pokémon! 
Everyone can do their part to keep nature clean. It doesn’t take much. 
I’m on patrol in pristine nature with my Pokémon like usual. Come to think of it, you’re always with Pokémon, too. 
We go on patrol to make sure there’s nothing strange going on. And occasionally, we battle! 
Thanks much! 
You know that Pokémon ability Pickup? I think that’s a good way of keeping the environment clean of litter.
Patrols day in and day out! And the occasional battle! 
In the embrace of Mother Nature, people and Pokémon grow strong! 
My, you are tough. 
You can grow strong anywhere. It doesn’t matter where you are. 
By battling tough opponents, both Trainers and Pokémon grow tough! 
We’ve grown strong together in nature and in the concrete jungle. We make everywhere we go our playground! 
You’re fantastically tough, aren’t you?! 
Look around you at this wildly contorted terrain. It’s no wonder that Pokémon would grow tough in a place like this. 
I think I’m pretty tough, but so are you and your Pokémon. Let’s have a battle to see who is the toughest! 
Are you getting worn out from all the running you’ve done? 
You’re not tired at all?! 
The world is full of Pokémon and all sorts of Trainers. 
What do you think of the Battle Zone? You’ve met so many Pokémon... I’ve got to battle you again! 
A Trainer riding a Pokémon! I like that! We’ve gotta battle! 
Awesome! You’re a real wild child! 
Riding the waves on a Pokémon’s back... Yeah, that’s something to talk about, all right. 
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about a rematch? 
Check out my physique! The rough seas sculpted this awesome body! 
Muscles I have plenty of... But let’s not talk about power. 
You’ve got your Pokémon using a hidden move for you... I find that really moving.
The rough seas here almost drowned... Wait, no, shaped my physique! See how buff it is! 
Check out my dynamic form! Victory is assured! 
Oh. That’s how it is. 
Being a good swimmer doesn’t make me any better as a Trainer... 
Hi! You’re that kid who’s great with Pokémon! I’ll battle with an even more dynamic form than before! Watch me now! 
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up and ready to go all out! 
Our muscles are deflating... 
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques! That was our game plan... 
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up! See, our muscles are twitching! 
People keep coming to us for battles. I really don’t know why! Teehee! 
OK, we lost. 
I wanted to be alone, but swatting away immature boys on the prowl... Well, my Pokémon grew tough without me really even trying. 
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?! Leave me alone! 
Are your Pokémon growing up? 
Maybe too grown up! 
I’ve grown with my Pokémon, too. My swimsuit’s getting a little tight... 
Did your Pokémon grow any more? My Pokémon? Mine are doing awesome! 
I’m a mermaid who drifts among the waves... But I’m also a playful girl who likes to have fun with Pokémon! 
Losing brings tears to my eyes... 
A mermaid’s tears are so salty... 
I remain a mermaid who drifts among the waves... But I’m also a playful girl who likes to have fun with Pokémon! 
I want to be with my water Pokémon. That’s why I swim. 
Glub glub... I’m sinking... 
Everyone I know says they have to train harder and more often. I thought so too, but I find it hard to get that serious about it. Being with my Pokémon puts me in a mellow mood, I guess. 
I want to be with my water Pokémon. That’s why I want to be stronger! 
                                                                 
                    
                                                         
With one mighty flap, my birds blow away the embers of aggression! 
We failed to get off the ground... 
The HM Fly isn’t useful inside caves. It’s such a shame. 
Dragons and a fiery mountain... It’s a totally classic setup! 
Losing isn’t a happy occasion... 
My Pokémon seem to like it here a lot. 
Are you seeking the mythical Pokémon, too? Let’s battle, then! 
There’s nothing left... 
The mythical Pokémon that sleeps deep in a volcano... Could it be a dragon Pokémon? 
What it means to win battles... That is what I seek. Teach me if you will! 
I grow less certain still... 
Perhaps there is no meaning to victory, but still I will battle! That is what makes me a Trainer! 
Being with Pokémon makes me happy. And when we win, I feel happier still! 
We’re still happy even when we lose! 
Raising Pokémon to the extremes... Having fun with Pokémon... People should do whatever makes them happy. That’s what I think! 
I was born in Floaroma Town. I’m sure thrilled to be here. It took a long time to get here. We’re not going to lose again! 
We went down... We couldn’t stick it out... 
You can level all you want, but that won’t guarantee you any wins. But we keep trying to get better. That’s what makes us Trainers. 
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather here aren’t pushovers. They all have tricks up their sleeves! 
You’re not a Trainer that can be taken lightly! 
The Pokémon you’ll meet here won’t make it easy for you to move onward. 
You’ve come all this way for Pokémon? You must be dedicated. 
Your dedication won out. 
The Pokémon here must battle each other all the time. That must be why they are so strong in this area. 
My Pokémon and I are pretty nice, but not when it comes to a battle! 
I couldn’t unleash the real me... 
When you’re raising Pokémon, you need to be both firm and gentle. 
I came here after winning my way through the Battle Tower! 
But... I had a win streak going... 
Train more at the Battle Tower... That’s what I’ll do. 
We’re all good to go! We just have to battle now! 
Aww... I’m out of useful items! 
We came completely unprepared for this little adventure... 
I had a revelation this morning. I knew that I would have a wonderful encounter here today. 
There’s nothing wonderful about this! 
Is my sense of premonition nothing to write home about? 
I’ll use my mystifying psychic power to pulverize you! 
That’s what I get for making idle claims... 
Psychic power is a mystery that defies explanation. But if everything could be explained, it would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything. And you think you can win?! 
We weren’t up to the task! 
Even though my team could break bricks and shatter boulders, they failed to dent your spirits! 
Hear the howl of my iron fists! Howdy! I’m crazy for karate! 
Losing made it clear to me. You’re crazy about Pokémon! 
I love seeing people who love Pokémon more than anything! 
What do you expect to achieve here? I’ll be the one to make that call! 
You’ve earned the right to be here. Both you and your Pokémon. 
You may find it odd, but the stink of sulfur from the volcanic gas is what draws me here. 
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                  
                             
                                                          
                                                  
                             
                                   
                                                  
                             
                                                              
                                                  
                             
                                                     
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                          
                              
                                                            
                                                                            
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                                
                              
                                                            
I just got worked over! And by a kid no less... 
...! Again and again... 
It is our mission to stall you. Sorry, but we gotta do our job. 
Losing was a part of my job, too. ...I feel better by saying that. 
We won’t allow anyone to stop us from gathering the three Pokémon from the three lakes. 
In order for us to bring peace to the world, we must control it! 
You’re too young to understand. 
Our boss always had plans for the three lakes... While you were blissfully ignorant, our work went ahead... 
I’ll knock your Pokémon into orbit! 
My mind is going orbital! 
The Pokémon here has already been taken to our HQ in Veilstone City. It’s far too late for a child like you to make any difference. 
If this mission is successful, we will get a nice bonus. 
I’m heartbroken... 
I want Team Galactic to become powerful. That is all I want. 
...You, my friend, are tough! I can see why you defy us so... 
We set off the Galactic Bomb! Its blast force was phenomenal! 
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal power... 
So, you’re tough. Big deal. What do you think you can accomplish? There’s one of you up against the entire Team Galactic. By now, another crew should be on their way to Lake Verity near that puny little Twinleaf Town! 
I’ll punish you in place of our boss for defying Team Galactic! 
Grr... I took the punishment... 
We’re Team Galactic! The no. 1 syndicate in the world! To defy us is to defy the universe! 
...Would you like to join the MAGIKARP and flop around in the mud? 
...Overwhelming! 
I played you for a child, and paid a stiff price for my arrogance... However, you’re much too late. Team Galactic has already found the sunken island under the lake. And the Pokémon that lay in it? Well, what do you think? 
You’re tough, kid! But, I still pity the likes of you. 
Well, what have we here? A Trainer who’s lost their way? 
You’re lost but you won! That burns me up to eleven! 
You barged right into our HQ? You must not know what fear is, kid! 
You’re the first intruder we’ve had in our HQ! 
Oh, sure. Why don’t you just get all cocky about it! 
Without our special card key, you’re not going to get very far. Well, non-Team Galactic member? What’s your next move? 
Who do you think you are? Desecrating the halls of our HQ?! 
A tough little Trainer is what you are... 
We get around in Galactic HQ by a system of round warp panels. Do you think you will ever learn the way they connect? Good luck! 
Some people, like you, just don’t understand why we do what we do. You don’t understand Team Galactic. So why is it that you defy us?! 
I couldn’t understand the battle or your toughness... 
I went out of my way to deliver my cool lines before the battle! You should’ve let me win! Get a grip on reality, already! 
I’m, like, this close to getting my promotion to Commander. I’ll impress our great boss by making you my newest trophy! 
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one... I’ll probably get busted down to the gruntiest of the grunts... Humph!
                           
                
                                
                            
                        
                                                        
Intruder alert! There’s something smelly about you! 
Oh, it was my own Pokémon’s smell... 
There’s nothing smelly about us! We’re on the cutting edge of stuff! 
Having fun scampering around our HQ, you sneaky intruder? Your trail blazing will go out in a blaze of glory right now! 
Your trailblazing streak lives on! 
So what, you have momentum... It’s too late. The experiment’s done! 
You should be tired out by now. It’s Team Galactic’s turn to shine! 
What? I don’t get it. What’s your rush? 
Pokémon are that important to you? Is that what this is all about? 
Are you enjoying your unescorted, unauthorized, and unsettling tour of Team Galactic HQ? 
Let me do what I want! 
It doesn’t matter what happens to the Team Galactic HQ building. Soon, all will belong to Team Galactic, anyway! 
Hey there, little Trainer! You’re famous among Team Galactic. The order has been issued--we get a promotion if we put you down! 
I just blew my promotion... 
What’s so special about you anyway? You’re just like any other little kid Trainer you can find anywhere!
Our time has come! It’s Team Galactic’s time now! 
When’s it gonna be my turn... 
It’s too late! No amount of desperation from a kid like you will make a difference! 
Our time will come. A time for only us! I’m going to turn back your time! To a time before Pokémon! 
Gyah! 
You can struggle all you want, but you can’t stop Team Galactic alone! It doesn’t matter how many Pokémon you try to use as your tools! 
Team Galactic is all powerful! Only a fool would show defiance to the mighty might of Team Galactic! 
Not standing up to the mighty is foolish, you say... 
It doesn’t matter if you’re an adult or a kid if you have Pokémon... Pokémon are the equalizers. I should have realized sooner...
I can’t believe you chased me here... OK, let’s see how tough you are. 
Where do you get that power?! 
Mt. Coronet... I might be just a grunt, but even I can tell it has a weird energy! 
This is our final operation. No one will interfere! 
You turned the tables on me... I call interference... 
The closer you are to the peak, the closer you are to space! Soon, Team Galactic will... Uh... Team Galactic will achieve greatness! 
Team Galactic will take control of everything! You can try all you want, but you can’t do anything alone! 
All you gave me was the taste of defeat... 
...Is our boss about to ditch us and claim everything for himself?
We grunts have been assigned two noble jobs. One, ensure the success of our operation at the summit! Two, utterly destroy anyone who dares interfere! 
I don’t accept this! I will not accept this! 
Join Team Galactic and then abide by our rules. That would solve all our problems! 
Say, listen, do you realize you’re breaking hearts by being successful? It’s your fault that Team Galactic members are in so much pain... 
See? You’ve left me brokenhearted, too... 
Someone’s joy is another person’s sorrow... Everyone be happy and laughing? How ridiculous! Team Galactic should be doing all the laughing! 
...Our boss is going to do something huge at the summit. But here I am dealing with some pesky intruder. You’re spoiling the atmosphere. You can lose quickly, right? 
You’re not supposed to work me over like that. 
All my excitement’s gone now... This whole Mt. Coronet trip is too rough, long, and draining... 
You’ve worked so hard to get here. You should be proud of yourself! And now, I’ll send you packing home with only that happy thought! 
Wh-- How dare you! That’s how you respond to my generosity? 
We couldn’t stop you... We’ll be discarded as useless... Our boss is ruthless that way... 
Oh, yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too! 
What the?! We’re in trouble?! But there’s no giving up on me! 
What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?! 
Oh, yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too! 
What the?! We’re in trouble?! But there’s no giving up on me!

Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to be tough!

Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to be tough!

We’ve gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty of times before! 
We’re not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon have given up!

What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?! 
I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason to freak out. 
We’re not finished yet! We’ll get out of this spot because we’re so tight! 
What just went down?! My team still needs raising?!

Not yet! Your first Pokémon League victory doesn’t come easily, kid! 
I will now concede defeat. But I think you came to see how great Bug-type Pokémon can be. I hope you also realized what you’re up against in the Pokémon League. Battling is a deep and complex affair... 
Dear child, don’t assume for an instant that you’ve won. 
Well! Dear child, I must say, that was most impressive. Your Pokémon believed in you and did their best to earn you the win. Even though I’ve lost, I find myself with this silly grin!
I can feel your determination. Your will is overpowering me! 
This situation... This is heating up! I’m blazing now! 
...! I wasn’t expecting this! I wasn’t looking down on you... But I didn’t think for one second that I’d lose! This is fantastic! You and your Pokémon are inspiring! 
Hmm... Now what should I do... 
I see... You getting past the three before me was no fluke. Your power is real. 
I can’t remember the last time I was put in a corner like this! 
I won’t let this end yet! This match is too fun to let it end this easily! 
...Just a few minutes ago, you were the most powerful challenger. And just now, you became the most powerful of all the Trainers. You are now our newest Champion! 
You got Pokémon! I got Pokémon! Let’s see whose Pokémon is the best! 
I give up! You’re too much! Are you maybe a Pokémon genius? 
Making Pokémon battle each other makes them tougher, you know? 
Hi, what kinds of Pokémon do you have with you? I’ll show you my Pokémon while we have a battle. 
Huh? It’s over already?! I thought I’d win for sure! 
You’re too tough! I won’t battle you again! Just joking! I’ll challenge you again when I level up my Pokémon. 
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, and so am I. When Trainers lock eyes, that means a battle is on! 
Losing makes me mad, but that was still a bunch of fun!
With Pokémon that tough, I bet you could go anywhere in Sinnoh!

Huh? It’s over, you say? 
We’ll come at you with our hearts ablaze! 
Your heart burns as hot as mine! 
This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve trained since then! 
Whew... You’re overtrained for me. 
I knew you were headed back here. I felt it with the soles of my feet! 
I got a good taste of your power!

The conditions weren’t very good. 
Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn’t help! 
Gwaaah! This is hurting! 
Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again! Our rhythm of battle! 
Can you hear it? That’s my guitar weeping... 
Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to show you my skill. This time, I’ll shows you why they consider me an ace! 
I’m burning with jealousy over your talent! 
Ace Trainers always work to improve their natural-born talents. 
I see... I have to concede defeat. 
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of Pokémon you can see there? 
You’re one enthusiastic Trainer. 
Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve battled before, haven’t we? 
You sure showed me up. 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. You sing, too! 
Your Pokémon... They’re looking good! 
Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea, in a boat, just you and me! That’s the way of the Sailor! Way of the Sailor. You sing, too!

Ah, it’s you. I’m bored yet again. Care to break the monotony? 
The monotony was broken, but... 
Ah, it’s you. I’m bored yet again. Care to break the monotony? 
The monotony was broken, but... 
I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the Pokémon League. 
I’m shocked... No, really. 
I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m challenging the Pokémon League! 
Blblblblugh... 
It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have toughened me up! 
The world remains as harsh as ever... 
It doesn’t matter how long it takes, I’m going to the Pokémon League! 
Th-this is so hard... 
How much stronger did your Pokémon become? Let me check for you, OK? 
I’ve had my fill... 
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to become powerful. 
Your battle style... 
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to know what all this means! 
I see... So that’s what it was... 
See? You’ve come back again. There must be something that draws you here... 
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather marvelous... 
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an excuse to slack off. I take pride in challenging those who have bested me before! 
I see... Simply outstanding.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so, we train here daily! 
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out to be the Battle Zone... 
I’ve cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s abilities! I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again! 
Raising abilities alone doesn’t mean I can win either... 
What’s missing from my game... Have you discovered yours yet? 
I see it now... 
The urge to battle you again has struck me. Humor me! 
I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge... 
We’ve faced many challengers since we met, but they were all weak... I relish the tough resistance that only you can provide! 
I’ve found a tough adversary in you... 
Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back, just like before. 
Hmm... 
You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw! 
What I saw in the future turned out to be true... 
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an astonishingly cool manner! 
Right after this, I have to pay out your prize money... 
This time! This time I will win! My spirit is renewed and strong! 
My spirit is broken... 
Do you remember my slogan? People! Nature! Pokémon! That’s right. Harmony is essential! 
You’re A-OK! 
By battling tough opponents, both people and Pokémon grow tough! 
My, you are tough. 
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about a rematch? 
Awesome! You’re a real wild child! 
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?! 
OK, we lost. 
                                                    
                                 
Does this mean I’m only talented as an Artist? 
You’re a lucky one... 
I never thought I’d lose at Papa’s restaurant... 
Ohh... How could I lose at dear Papa’s restaurant? 
Ack! I lost... Check, please!  
So young, and yet so strong! How very remarkable!
I don’t care if I lose. I’m still a happy guy. 
Waaah! You’re too much! 
Wow... You’re out there. 
No one’s hurt? 
Tough, aren’t you...? 
I was with my daddy, too... 
That’s quite the demonstration. 
Hmm... I should have expected this.
My luck’s run out... 
I think I have what it takes to become a successful model! 
Hmm... I failed to foresee this outcome... 
You know, I had confidence before heading into this. 
Yeah, like I’m really supposed to win with a Pokémon like this...
We spend all our time battling in the blizzards of Snowpoint City. We’ll show you how it’s toughened us up! 
What’s with your toughness?! 
You’ve battled all over, you say? That makes you tough, perhaps. 
I’ve only been involved with Pokémon for a short time. I managed to get this far because skilled friends toughened me up! 
I can’t believe how tough you are! 
If you have wonderful friends, there is no limit to how far you can go. 
Our mission is to implement our operations without question. It is all for the new world order that our boss will lead! 
This won’t go unpunished... 
I’m quite prepared to do anything to be promoted. One day, and soon, you will learn the true might of Team Galactic! 
I won’t let you disrupt our research! This is for Team Galactic! 
I got whipped... I look pathetic... 
Our boss is a scientific genius! He will make the power of mythical Pokémon his own! 
Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the- art facility! A snot-nosed kid like you ought to keep your dirty hands to yourself! 
You and your Pokémon weren’t part of my calculations... 
Our boss is trying to create an entirely new world. A world only for us! For Team Galactic! 
Bika bikabika! Pigachu! 
Pikachu... 
Pika... I’ll need a lot more practice to become a real PIKACHU... 
I work at a red-hot foundry. Watch out, I’m on fire! 
I burned out... 
I toughened up my muscles from honest work. Pokémon have nothing on me! 
Well! It’s not often we get a visitor like you to the ironworks! Let’s mark the occasion with a battle! 
Fire! 
The floor panels move automatically. We’re pretty proud of them here! 
Are you maybe getting annoyed by where the floor panels take you? 
I’m going down in flames! 
The sweat of a working man is beautiful to behold... There is also beauty in the tears wept from defeat... 
The toughest of all the grunts! That was me... 
Arrgh! I let some little kid beat me! 
Sheesh... I should have done the fighting myself. 
Humph! You’ve toughened up. But you’re no match for our boss. 
Done in by two kids?! This isn’t right! 
I should have kept my head down and just watched our warehouse... 
Fweh... If I didn’t run... I could’ve...battled harder... 
My last Pokémon. 
I see... I may lose if this pace continues... 
Interesting. And quite curious. 
I admit that you have pushed me to this extreme. 
This... This cannot be! It’s not possible that I lose! 
I won’t accept this! The power spoken of in mythology... I didn’t just make it obey me, I made it my own! 
I feel like crying... This is so sad... 
What a tough combination! I can’t believe it! 
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough, my Pokémon get tougher! 
What just went down?! You’re telling me I lost again?! 
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough, my Pokémon get tougher! 
What just went down?! You’re telling me I lost again?! 
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough, my Pokémon get tougher! 
What just went down?! You’re telling me I lost again?! 
I’m not giving up till the end! I can’t give up! 
What just went down?! You wait! I’ll get tougher! 
I’m not giving up till the end! I can’t give up! 
What just went down?! You wait! I’ll get tougher! 
I’m not giving up till the end! I can’t give up! 
What just went down?! You wait! I’ll get tougher! 
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace? 
My pace is completely off... 
If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace?

Would you like to do something else?
Oh, that’s OK. Next time will be fine.
Huh? You want to give me your [VAR(281, 2)]?
Thanks, but no. I can’t take that from you. Maybe another time!

Use them, and you’ll be able to touch walls to dig out all sorts of stuff! I’m sure you can dig them out before the wall comes tumbling down! You can do it! Good luck, youngster!
I can’t accept anything that important!
Thanks for the offer, but I’ll pass. See you again tomorrow.

Hmm... I can’t really decide. 
Oh, really? [VAR(286, 5)]? Well, for me... [VAR(286, 6)]!

Sure thing! As my “Greetings,” here’s my Trainer Case.
Huh? My Trainer Case... Where’d it go now? Sorry! I’ll show you another time!
I’m just showing my Trainer Case as my way of a greeting.
I hope I get to know you better!
Oh, did you want to draw with me? Sure thing, but wait just a second.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s get drawing!
Oh, sorry! I can’t now. Let’s draw another time.

Oh, all right. Come see me anytime, OK?
OK! Let’s do some drawing together!
                                          
The last letter of what you draw has to be the first letter I draw?
Stop drawing funny faces! It hurts to laugh so much!

...Uh-huh... What is that? That’s supposed to be me?
A battle? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s get our battle started!
Sorry! My Pokémon don’t seem to be feeling too well right now. Let me battle you another time.
If you want to battle, you need two Pokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower. 
Whoa! I can tell you’re pretty tough!
You used that move? That’s good strategy!
Way to go! That was an eye-opener!
Oh! How could you use that Pokémon in that situation?
You want to trade, huh? Sure, hold on just a second.
All right! Let’s trade!
Sorry! I don’t have a Pokémon I can trade right now. Let’s trade some other time.
Oh yeah! I really wanted this Pokémon!
Finally, I got that Pokémon I’ve wanted for such a long time.
You can’t trade if you have only one Pokémon with you. 
If you want to do something with me, just give me a shout!
You want to mix records with me? OK, I just need a little time.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s mix our records, then.
Oh, I’m sorry. I have too much to do right now. Another time, OK?
[VAR(259, 0)]: We’re going to mix our records now. I know! [VAR(259, 1)], do you want to mix your records with us, too?

OK! Let’s mix our records!
Oh, sorry! I just can’t right this instant. Another time, OK?
It’s fun mixing records!
I’m going to mix records with everyone!
Mix it up! Keep mixing!
You should mix records, too!

As my introduction, I’ll show you my Trainer Case.
Oh? Now where did I put my Trainer Case...? Sorry! I’ll show you later!
We’re showing each other our Trainer Cases to get acquainted.
Glad to meet you. Please don’t be a stranger!
You want to draw with me? Sure! Just give me a second...
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
Oh, I’m sorry! Let’s draw another time!
[VAR(259, 0)]: We were drawing right now. Oh, I know! [VAR(259, 1)], would you like to draw with us?
Oh... Please come by anytime.
OK! Thanks for waiting! Let’s get drawing!
Sorry! I just can’t right now! Let’s draw some other time.
Wow! You’re really good!
Ahaha! What is that?!
I love drawing! I can draw and draw!
Oops! I can’t stay inside the lines!
A battle? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
I’m terribly sorry, but my Pokémon aren’t feeling well... Let’s battle another time.
If you want to battle, you need two Pokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower. 
That Pokémon... It’s been raised really well!
That’s it! This is the right move now!
That’s awesome! You can battle that way?
You have exquisite timing for switching Pokémon!
A trade? Of course, but I need time to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
I’m sorry, but I don’t have any Pokémon that I can trade now... Let’s trade some other time!
I’m trading Pokémon right now.
I finally got that Pokémon I wanted in a trade!
You can’t trade if you have only one Pokémon with you. 
If you want to do something with me, don’t be shy. Just ask!
You want to mix records? Sure! But I need a little time!
Sorry I made you wait! Let’s get started!
Oh, sorry! Let’s do this another time!
[VAR(259, 0)]: We were just mixing our records. I know! [VAR(259, 1)], would you like to mix your records with us, too?
Oh... Please come by anytime.
Thanks for waiting! Let’s mix some records!
Oh, sorry! Let’s do this another time!
It’s so fun to mix records!
I’m going to keep mixing!
Let’s mix it up!
I wonder what’s going to happen?
                         
                       
                     
                           
                                                            
                 
                                
                                             
                     
               
               
               
                      
Welcome to the Union Room. If there is anything you need help with, please let me know!
How may I help you?
Which topic would you like me to explain?
In the Union Room, you may battle with two Pokémon of your choice that are Lv. 30 or lower. When you visit here, we recommend that you bring Pokémon that meet this requirement. 
You may trade your Pokémon with other players. Meeting new people could be a shortcut to meeting rare Pokémon! 
You may communicate with other players and mix your records. What will happen if you mix records, you ask? We recommend that you try it and see! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
                                                                                                                                    
You may get together with others and draw. You all get to work on one sheet of paper at the same time. I’m sure a drawing made by friends will be a memorable masterpiece! Up to five players can take part, so try it with your friends! 
You can chat with other people by selecting “CHAT” in the menu. Go out and meet other players in the Union Room! Let people know what you’re like and what you’d like to do. Mingle, chat, and add to your circle of friends! 
Oh! Here comes someone now! Instead of me, why not strike up a chat with our newcomer? 
It’s rather boring if no one comes to visit... What might we do for entertainment...? 
Do you sometimes get mistaken for a real [VAR(270, 0)]? I just seem to get that feeling from you. 
Hello! That’s right! It’s important to say a greeting! If someone arrives, let’s try to be friendly! 
Greetings! [VAR(284, 0)]? It’s wonderful! I really like it, too! When you meet someone for the first time, the proper etiquette is to introduce yourself. By introducing yourself, you’ll get to know about the other person, too! 
[VAR(284, 0)] Trainer? That’s what you are? Isn’t that something! But I’m sorry to say, I don’t have any Pokémon... I would rather watch than battle, you see. 
Oh! Your [VAR(284, 0)]! I would love to have it! Please trade me! ... I was actually joking. I don’t have any Pokémon, so I can’t trade with anyone... 
[VAR(284, 0)]? I can understand you’d want one... But you shouldn’t expect people to make trades just for you. You also have to consider what Pokémon the other person wants. 
Welcome to the Union Room! I’m the only one here now, but please do bring your friends for some fun and excitement! If you have time on your hands, I’m also here to chat. You see, I have a lot of time on my hands... 
I’m quite good at drawing! If it’s [VAR(284, 0)], leave it to me! No one’s better than me at it! 
Oh, you’re leaving... ... It makes me feel lonesome... Please do come visit again! 
What’s wrong? Are you feeling down about something? If you’re feeling blue, it’s much better to have fun with friends than to be alone. 
[VAR(284, 0)]? Yes, please! ...I do want to join in, but I’m on duty here, so I can’t... Sigh... [VAR(284, 0)]... I wish I could... 
[VAR(284, 0)]? Me, too, please! But I need to stay here and attend to our visitors... Please enjoy it with your friends! 
[VAR(284, 0)]? You’re inviting me? Oh, but I have to stay here and attend to our visitors. I’m sorry. I’d love to accept, but I really can’t. 
That’s right! Sometimes, it might be better to just go and invite other people. But don’t get too selfish or pushy because you want to [VAR(284, 0)]. 
Yes! It’s OK! Nothing is impossible. Think positively and keep your chin up! 
Everyone has at least one thing they aren’t good at. You should never try to make someone do what they don’t want to do. Incidentally, [VAR(284, 0)] is something that I would like to do. 
Good luck! I hope you enjoy serious battles. You can’t experience ones like this in the Union Room! 
You want to chat? Well, you shouldn’t be wasting your time chatting with me. You need to be more active and talk to other players. After all, you can’t make friends if you don’t talk to people. 
Where are you? Um... Right before my eyes. Oh! Are you maybe an impostor? The real player is somewhere else? ...That’s ridiculous! Please, don’t be silly! My word! 
[VAR(284, 0)] trade? That sounds fun! I would love to as well. But telling me that won’t help. I can’t trade with anyone. 
If you want to have a [VAR(284, 0)] Battle, you need to be more assertive and talk to other players. If you can’t assert yourself, you may never get a chance at a [VAR(284, 0)] Battle!

Which Sphere will you trade me for my [VAR(281, 2)]?
All right! Let’s do this trade!
Oh, now wait a second! You don’t have any room for this!
That’s not the right kind of Sphere!

Roark: Hey! [VAR(259, 0)]! Is this maybe your first time here? Welcome to Sinnoh’s Underground! Huh? Where is this, you ask? Doesn’t the Radar make it obvious? This is a giant underground network of passages underneath Sinnoh. Huh? What am I doing down in this expanse of a place? That’s kind of hard to answer. I mean, you can do pretty much anything you want down here. For instance, you can dig up Treasure, Spheres, and make a Secret Base. You can play with your friends down here, too. You should talk to the Underground Man in Eterna City. I have to get going now. I’ll see you around!
