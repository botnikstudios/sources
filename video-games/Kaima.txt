'......'
No...
I have to... survive...

SEARINA
'Damn, there''s way too many of you!'
Fighting these things head on was a mistake.

SEARINA
Only one way to go if I don't want to die!

SEARINA
This is only a strategic retreat!
I'm outta here!!

SEARINA
'Hey, get up!'
Those things will devour you!
ILLI
'...'
SEARINA
'Uhh?'
'Did you hear me?'

SEARINA
Shit!
They're coming!!

SEARINA
'Alright sourpuss,'
come with me!

SEARINA
'You ready?'
Let's fight!!

SEARINA
I'll protect you!!

SEARINA
Somehow... I barely survived.
ILLI
'...'

SEARINA
'You really hurt yourself, huh?'
But it looks like you're still alive.
ILLI
'...'

SEARINA
'Damn, you''re strong.'
Good thing we teamed up!

SEARINA
'Hey, you totally saved me!'
ILLI
'...I didn''t want to watch someone die again.'
SEARINA
'Yikes, what a thing to say as your first line!'
'Anyway I didn''t want you to die either,'
so I guess that makes us the same.

ILLI
I have to stop all this...
SEARINA
'The monsters? There''s way too many.'
'We can''t just fight them off forever,'
even if it's the two of us!
ILLI
Then go.
I'll do it alone...
SEARINA
'You aren''t listening, are you?'
'Someone''s causing this, so shouldn''t we'
'be aiming for that person instead?'
ILLI
'...'

SEARINA
Holy shit.
You're strong!!

SEARINA
Wait!!
There's only more monsters that way!
ILLI
I have to stop all this...
SEARINA
'You aren''t listening, are you?'
'Do you want to die fighting a pointless battle,'
'or ACTUALLY beat whoever''s causing it?'
ILLI
'...'
SEARINA
'Do I have to drag you away myself?'

SEARINA
Can't turn back now!

SEARINA
She can take care of herself.
I'll save the world on my own!

SEARINA
Looks like I'll be safe for a while
so long as I don't go back that-a-way.
SEARINA
Fighting those monsters head on
'was no good, so, new plan!!'
Find who's causing all this and wreck 'em!

SEARINA
Looks like we'll be safe for a while
if we continue in this direction.

SEARINA
My name''s SEARINA by the way.'
'What''s yours?'
ILLI
'...'

SEARINA
'Just kidding, I saw it during battle.'
'It''s ILLI right?'
Let's save the world together!

SEARINA
'...If you don''t want to say it yourself,'
I have other ways of finding out!

SEARINA
ILLI, huh?'
'Come on, let''s save the world together!!'

ILLI
'...'
SEARINA
You're not very talkative.
That's fine! I'll lead the way.

SEARINA
'...She''ll be fine.'
Gotta save myself.

SEARINA
That way's definitely hopeless.

I'll hold them off!
'You run to safety, miladies!'


MANLY
I'll hold them off!
'You run to safety, milady!'


SEARINA
'Uhh, okay?'
Don't get killed!

MANLY
No need to worry about me!
It's a man's duty to protect girls!

SEARINA
'If that''s how it is,'
I won't feel bad when you die.

MANLY
A man's duty...!
'Pretty cool of me, right?'

Bones
Couldn't fight...
Couldn't win...

SEARINA
'Hey, better luck in the next life, guy.'

PURPLE
I don't know what to do...
I don't know which way to go...

SEARINA
Well don't just sit there!
It's dangerous.
Pick a direction and run!!

PURPLE
I can't choose...
I can't decide...

SEARINA
That's fine.
We'll stop the person responsible
for eating up KAIMA before you die.'
SEARINA
Hm. Then I guess I'll be
leaving you behind too.
Good luck!

PURPLE
I can't do anything alone...
There's nothing I can do...

SEARINA
Gotta choose another path!

SEARINA
The monsters are closing in...
Better go fight their boss soon!

Bones
Save yourself...
Be strong...
SEARINA
'Who are you talking to?'

Bones
Save yourself...
Be strong...

Bones
Aaaahhh.... aahh.........
This is... fine......
SEARINA
You gave up too easy!
Have a little more will to live!!

Bones
Aaaahhh.... aahh.........
This is... fine......

SEARINA
'Why''s a soul floating around?'
'Lose your body?'
GREYSOUL
Those monsters ate it up... so I ran away.
'Ran, flew, whatever.'
'It''s pretty tragic, what''s going on.'
SEARINA
Yep! Wanna join forces and beat up
'the person responsible for all this?'
GREYSOUL
No thanks.
Souls like me can't affect the physical world.
Most people just ignore me actually.
SEARINA
Probably because you're so miserable.

GREYSOUL
'Can people... normally hear souls?'
'Is that why no one responded to me before?'
'Why are you different...?'

GREYSOUL
'Hey, saw you take out that monster.'
I could never be that cool...
'but uh, go you.'

COWGIRL
Fuckin' monsters showin' up everywhere.
And no one's doin' shit about it!
SEARINA
'Hey, I''ve been doin'' shit!'
SEARINA
You're right!
'But if it''s just this one, I can try.'
COWGIRL
'Yeah? If you ain''t kiddin'' about that,'
hurry up and get ridda this thing then!

COWGIRL
'You all talk or what?'

COWGIRL
Sorry for doubtin' you before.
I wanna believe you got a
pretty good chance too...

NEON
Anywhere you turn...
They're coming from every direction...
Like they're all closing in on us...
SEARINA
Yeah it's pretty dire!
But I'm working on it.
NEON
If you save us from this one here...
I'll give you something. Anything...!
SEARINA
Noted!

NEON
Please destroy it soon...
It might free itself at any moment...!

NEON
I hope my gift is of use to you...
Thanks again.

SEARINA
It's busy eating the ground...
But I can't risk fighting alone!

SEARINA
It's busy eating the ground...

SEARINA
'Oh, it''s over?'
'Thanks, ILLI.'

SEARINA
'How did you manage to almost die, ILLI?'
Lucky I could win for us.

SEARINA
The monster is nice and dead now!
You two are saved!
COWGIRL
'Damn, you really did it...'
Good job.
NEON
Here...!
'Take this Token of Gratitude for your trouble.'
SEARINA
Cool! Sidequest complete.
One step closer to the big bad boss.

COWGIRL
'You''re thinkin'' of takin'' on Prince VIDO...?'
Do you realize how many people have
'gone off to die, tryin'' that?'
ILLI
'VIDO...'
COWGIRL
You're lookin' at a 100% failure rate!
Don't rush off to your deaths all stupid!
ILLI
I'll kill him...
I'll kill him for what he did...

SEARINA
'ILLI?'
'What''s up?'
ILLI
I have to make him pay.
He has to pay!!
SEARINA
Yeah I think everyone feels that way.
'Come on, let''s keep going then!'

SEARINA
This problem can wait.

Bones
They ate everything up...
Until there was nothing left to stand on...
Ha... haha... a dead end...
SEARINA
'Yep, dead end indeed.'

Bones
'How far will this spread...?'
Someone... please...!
SEARINA
'Don''t worry, I''m on it!'

Bones
'How far will this spread...?'
Someone... please...!

SEARINA
'...Huh?!'
The lid's too heavy to lift on my own...

SEARINA
ILLI!
'Help me out, will ya?'
ILLI
'...Okay.'

SEARINA
0!'
Whoever equips this will be pretty tough to kill.

SEARINA
The chest is empty now!

SEARINA
Still empty!

Bones
I thought I would be safe here...!
'N-no, stop!! Aaaaahhh!!!'
SEARINA
'If I could figure out a way to get here,'
obviously the monsters would too.

Bones
I thought I would be safe here...!
'N-no, stop!! Aaaaahhh!!!'

SEARINA
'I found Underarmor!'
If I equip this I can take more hits.

Bones
This is MY loot!
I won't let you have it...!!
SEARINA
Sorry but you can't stop me.
I'll put it to good use!
SEARINA
Looks like whoever killed you
wasn't really concerned with that.

SISTER
My little brother is over there!
'He won''t listen to me, I think he''s'
too scared to cross back!!
0, 5, 0
SEARINA
He seemed more bratty than scared.


SEARINA
'Your family''s been separated?'
That's no good at all!


SISTER
If it weren't for these monsters...
Why hasn't the princess done anything
'to save us?!'
SEARINA
It's alright.
You can leave it to me instead.

SISTER
He's the only family I have left...
I don't understand why he'd leave my side!

SISTER
Thank you...
'Even if the world is coming to an end,'
I'm glad we won't have to die alone.
SEARINA
You won't have to die at all!
Have faith in me and ILLI!

SISTER
You're making a difference...
We believe in you.

BROTHER
'...Sorry.'

BROTHER
Go away!
I just want to be left alone to die!!
SEARINA
That won't do.
Come with me!
BROTHER
'Why should I?'
'What''ll you give me if I do?'
SEARINA
'Your safety and happiness, kid,'
I can't offer much else.
BROTHER
Then I'm not moving!!

BROTHER
'I''m not listening, lalala.'
'Not until I get something good, lalala.'

BROTHER
'You''re really giving me something?'
'Woah, thanks!'
SEARINA
'Yeah you asshole kid, take it and go.'
I mean...


BROTHER
Go away!
I just want to be left alone to die!!
SEARINA
That won't do.
Come with me!
BROTHER
'Why should I?'
'What''ll you give me if I do?'
SEARINA
'Actually, you can have'
this token thing I got.
BROTHER
'You''re really giving me something?'
'Woah, thanks!'

SEARINA
'Uh, things are pretty dangerous right now'
so don't scare your sister like this anymore.
'Stick with her ''til it''s safe, okay?'
BROTHER
What do you care...
SEARINA
'I had a family too, until recently.'
It sucks to lose people you care about.
BROTHER
'...Yeah.'
Okay.

SEARINA
It's nice that they still have each other.
'We got a little sidetracked, but now there''s'
only one direction left to go from here!
ILLI
0...'
SEARINA
'Hm?'
'Wha-zel?'
!ruby/object:RPG::BGM {name: ILLI, volume: 80, pitch: 100
ILLI
'I won''t get to see her again,'
it won't be as easy as giving candy to a child
'to lure him back, we can''t reunite like they did!'
ILLI
'There won''t be a happy ending for me,'
'will there? Because he already killed her!'
EZEL's already dead!!
SEARINA
'Princess EZEL? Huh, I didn''t know she died.'
'That sucks, I guess. But you''re still alive,'
so it's not like you can't be happy.

ILLI
You don't understand!!
Of course you wouldn't...
'I already caught on, you know!'

SEARINA
'Caught on?'
'To what?'
ILLI
The fact that you don't have a soul!!
'You''re empty inside, that''s the only way you'
can be so chipper when our world is collapsing!
1, 11, 0, 2, 1
ILLI
That's why you keep "responding" to
dead things. A body can only hear a soul
if it doesn't already have one of its own.

SEARINA
'...You''re right.'
My soul got eaten by those monsters.
I lost it a little before I found you.
ILLI
Ha... haha...
Then I wasn't imagining it.
That means...
ILLI
'These things you''ve been doing for others,'
you don't ACTUALLY care for them.
'There''s no feeling in your words, it''s all fake.'

SEARINA
'Fake? Technically, yeah, it''s a bit of an act.'
I only kinda remember what right and wrong is.
'I can''t really feel, or judge it myself anymore.'

ILLI
'So then, what''s the point in any of this?'
What's the point in trying to make a difference
'when we''re only going to die in the end?!'
SEARINA
'Yeahhh it sucks, but, y''know?'
I'm still here. I'm not ready to quit being "alive".
That's why I want to keep fighting.
ILLI
'...'

SEARINA
I won't pretend to understand your feelings
'for the princess, but I know I''d have wanted'
to beat up anyone who hurt someone I liked.
SEARINA
That was the last thing I felt after all!
Before losing my soul.

ILLI
VIDO... is really strong.
You're not afraid of what will happen
'when we take him on?'

SEARINA
'I can''t feel stuff like that, remember?'
'But even if I did, I wouldn''t let it stop me.'
I have to save the world in order to live.
ILLI
'...'

SEARINA
'Hey, the monsters are closing in!'
'Aren''t you going to run away?'
PURPLE
'No... what would be the point of that?'
I don't have a reason... to go on living...
SEARINA
'Do you really need a reason?'
SEARINA
'...You''re not moving, huh?'
'If I don''t fight the monster,'
you'll get eaten up for real.

PURPLE
Just go...

PURPLE
'Even if you beat them,'
more will come...
The only choice is to die...
SEARINA
Don't give up yet!
We're going to try and stop him.

PURPLE
It won't make a difference...
But good luck...

Bones
'No... what would be the point of that?'
I don't have a reason... to go on living...
Bones
I can't do anything...
Not without you...
2, B, 0
Bones
Just go...

SEARINA
'Uh, wrong way.'

SEARINA
No more getting sidetracked.

Bones
Save yourself...
Be strong...

SEARINA
'Whoops, the world got eaten up'
behind us while we weren't looking.
ILLI
This is what happens...
When you run around
pretending to be a hero.

We should probably save that girl.
ILLI
You're not listening.
She's only in danger now because
we haven't dealt with VIDO yet.

SEARINA
'You wanna leave her to die?'
That doesn't feel right.
'What if she''s somebody''s EZEL?'
A, 0
ILLI
No one can compare to EZEL...
How dare you say that!

SEARINA
Either way.
Gotta act fast...

SEARINA
'Whew, glad you had my back.'

SEARINA
Those monsters really had it out for you.
At least you can still stand.

ILLI
EZEL was...
She meant everything to me.
She gave me a reason to live.
ILLI
EZEL was kind and loving!
She was the only person who's ever
cared about me before!! She...!
ILLI
'She didn''t deserve to die,'
not like that! She's the princess...!
'How could anyone defeat her...?'
SEARINA
'Oh, you finally opened up a little.'
ILLI
'Are you making fun of me?!'
SEARINA
'No, I was just thinking'
'if I could still feel emotions,'
I would be happy right now.
ILLI
'What are you talking about?'
You always look happy...
with that stupid expression.
SEARINA
I don't want to hear that from
the girl who's done nothing but
cry this whole time.
SEARINA
'Anyway, let''s go!'
Prince VIDO awaits!

SEARINA
'Stop, monsters!'

SEARINA
I was too late.
It seems to be satisfied...

Bones
Don't go...
Too strong...
SEARINA
'Are you underestimating me?'

Bones
Don't go...
Too strong...
SEARINA
'Are you underestimating us?'

Bones
Don't go...
Too strong...

Bones
Help! Help!
Please!! No...!!!!
SEARINA
Not very substantial last words there.

Bones
I have to!
Someone has to...!
SEARINA
You had the right idea.
Someone's gotta be the hero!

Bones
There's no chance...
Fighting alone...
SEARINA
'Shut up, I can do this!!'

Bones
There's no chance...
Fighting alone...
SEARINA
'Oh! Good thing I''m not alone, then.'

Bones
I haven't...
saved...
SEARINA
'Saved who?'

Bones
Prince...
'Why are you doing this...?'
SEARINA
'Ooh, foreboding.'

HERO
{PRINCE VIDO!!'
'You''re the one behind this, aren''t you?!'
VIDO
'What of it?'

HERO
Don't give me that!!
'Why are you destroying KAIMA?!'
'What could you possibly have to gain?'

VIDO
'...Calm down.'
This is the way it has to be.
HERO
'Where''s the princess...?!'
'You did something to her too, didn''t you?'
'Is that what this is, a power grab?!'
HERO
'Seriously, what the fuck!!'
'My home is gone, my family''s gone...!'
I... I'll kill you!!!!
VIDO
'Sorry, I can''t allow that.'

I'm beginning to lose count of how many
times I've had to do that.

VIDO
If they would just wait for the end...
They'll see...

ILLI
Straight ahead...
'That''s where VIDO is.'
SEARINA
'VIDO, like, the prince?'
'Is he the bad guy?'
ILLI
It's all because of him...
I won't forgive him...
SEARINA
'Yep, sounds like he''s the bad guy.'
Let's work together to stop him!

Bones
'My home is gone, my family''s gone...!'
I... I'll kill you!!!!
SEARINA
'Well, you tried.'

VIDO
'Have you come to kill me as well?'
SEARINA
That depends!
Would killing you stop the monsters
'and save the world?'
VIDO
Yes.
Though I don't recommend it.
SEARINA
0 is all eaten up...'
I don't think I can exist anymore.
So I have to stop this!
VIDO
Very well. I don't expect you'll listen to reason.
I can't allow anyone to go further than this...
Forgive me.

VIDO
ILLI...
I was afraid you'd come here.
!ruby/object:RPG::BGM {name: battle_against_vido, volume: 80, pitch: 100
0, 8, 1
SEARINA
'Oh, you and the prince know each other.'
'So this is a personal grudge?'
ILLI
I knew I couldn't face you alone...
So I brought along something else
who wants to stop you.
SEARINA
I was the one leading the way though!
VIDO
If you'd let me explain...
ILLI
You don't need to explain to me how you're
'a fucking monster, I already know!!'
I'll kill you for what you did to her!!!
VIDO
I see you're beyond reason...
Understandable.
I won't hold back.
SEARINA
0 from being eaten.'
I guess I shouldn't hold back either!
ILLI
If nothing else...
No one will be killed by you ever again.

SEARINA
The monsters went away!
'I guess our mission is complete?'
ILLI
How strange...
'He''s dead, but...'
I don't feel any better.
SEARINA
You should feel great!
We defeated the evil prince and everything.

ILLI
I hear her... calling to me...

SEARINA
'Huh?'
'Where are you taking off to?'

ILLI
VIDO... you murderer!!
You have no right to wear that crown!
VIDO
'...Perhaps not.'
But if you'd let me explain...
SEARINA
You've done some pretty unforgivable stuff.
'I only lost my soul to your monsters,'
but everyone else has had to suffer a lot more.
SEARINA
'I mean, eating up half the planet?'
'That''s like insanely evil, even for a demon.'
VIDO
This was the only way...
Though I suppose you're all
beyond hearing excuses.
ILLI
You killed EZEL...!
I'm going to put a stop to whatever your
fucked up plan is if it's the last thing I do!
SEARINA
'Yeah, this is a battle for vengeance!'
We've waited long enough to kick your ass.
So uh... get ready!
VIDO
Then I have no choice...

SEARINA
Saved from the brink of death...
That was a close one.
ILLI
'Is it over...?'

VIDO
I...LLI...

ILLI
Give her back...
Give back my EZEL!

VIDO
You don't... understand...
ILLI
'Why did you betray her...?'
'Why have you done any of this?'
'Answer me, then you can die!!'
VIDO
She's the reason...
for everything...
ILLI
'What... are you saying...?'
VIDO
I had to stop her... before she became
too powerful... I had to seal her...
in order to save KAIMA.
ILLI
'Seal?'
'Then she''s...?'
VIDO
'Alive, yes...'
I'll take you to her...

SEARINA
'Hello?'
'...Oh, you''re not dead.'
Just frozen.
SEARINA
This is a little spooky.

VIDO
'...Where did you come from?'
'Who are you?'
SEARINA
'I came from, uhh...'
'The other side of the world?'
0.'
VIDO
However you got here...
0''s seal.'
SEARINA
'Oh, I''m not interested in any of that.'
I'm just trying to survive.
VIDO
'Hmm, you''re...'
You could be of use to me.
VIDO
'SEARINA, was it?'
I'll allow you to live if you help me
to keep Princess EZEL sealed.
SURE, IF IT MEANS NOT DYING..., 2
0, SURE
SEARINA
Sounds fine to me!

1, IF IT MEANS NOT DYING...
SEARINA
All I really care about is self-preservation.
'So yeah, alright, I''ll help you!'


VIDO
You're doing the world a favor...
Even if no one else can seem to grasp that.
Now I won't have to fight this battle alone.

ILLI
EZEL!!
You're really still here...!
VIDO
This is the best I could do...
Keeping her in this state requires
an incredible amount of power.
VIDO
I had no choice but to collect that power
through those monsters... Everything they
devour is converted to raw energy.
VIDO
And that raw energy... will soon be
enough to destroy Princess EZEL
once and for all.

ILLI
'Why would you want to destroy her...?'
VIDO
My sister... had a terrible secret.
To become more and more powerful...
she cannibalized other demons.

SEARINA
'She ate them?'
'Souls and all??'

ILLI
You fucking liar!!
This is just some sick fantasy you're using
to justify your horrible actions!!!
VIDO
No one has believed me so far...
Princess EZEL's followers truly are devoted.
That's how she was able to devour so many...
VIDO
Imagine happening upon something like that.
'Seeing someone you thought you could trust,'
swallowing another demon whole.
VIDO
I had to stop her.
There was no other way.
SEARINA
So this was all in order to kill your sister...
'Whether it was right or wrong, the world is'
still getting eaten up right now.
SEARINA
'What do we do?'

ILLI
0...?'

EZEL
ILLI... I knew you would come.
Thank you for releasing me
from my brother's seal.
SEARINA
'The prince really sealed up the princess?'
'Wait, for siblings they look nothing alike...'
ILLI
EZEL! You're alive...!
You're okay...!!
EZEL
'Shh, yes, yes...'
I'm here.
SEARINA
'...I shouldn''t intrude on this touching reunion.'
SEARINA exits stage left!

SEARINA
The monsters have all disappeared.
So KAIMA really IS saved.
My job here is done!

SEARINA
'What''s a girl to do now...?'
'My family is gone, along with half the world.'
Having nothing to work toward feels strange.
SEARINA
'Strange feeling...?'
'Oh, emptiness.'
That's what it was called.

SEARINA
Empty and aimless...
'Well, at least I can relax.'

ILLI
'If I kill you, the monsters will stop'
and EZEL will revive...
VIDO
'It''s up to you, whether or not you'
'listen to me... Whatever the conclusion,'
I've done all I can up to this point.
STOP ILLI, DO NOTHING, 2
0, STOP ILLI
!ruby/object:RPG::BGM {name: title, volume: 80, pitch: 100
SEARINA
'Wait, ILLI...'
Let's not be hasty!

ILLI
Like something without a soul
would understand...
There's no other choice for me.
SEARINA
'I was just thinking, if I had a soul,'
it wouldn't want to watch someone get killed.
Even if it's the bad guy.
0, 15, 0
ILLI
Liar...
The girl from before...
SEARINA
'We were in a rush to get here, weren''t we?'
There was nothing we could do about that.
Anyway...
SEARINA
Isn't there any way you can release the seal
'without having to die over it?'
VIDO
Releasing it voluntarily would undo everything
I've worked toward up to now...

ILLI
I know what you're after...
You're trying to become the one and only
ruler of KAIMA. I won't let you.
SEARINA
'See, ILLI''s ready to make you do it either way.'
Don't you think it's better to choose the option
'where you get a chance to live?'
VIDO
A chance to live...
We'll see about that.
VIDO
Fine.
Allow me to show you my sister's true form.

ILLI
EZEL...!
EZEL
ILLI... I'm so happy to see you again.
'But, forgive me, my dear.'
I need to have a word with my brother.
ILLI
O-of course...
I'm just glad you're still alive.

EZEL
'Hello, VIDO.'
I'm surprised you actually listened to her.
'Shouldn''t a prince have more resolve?'
VIDO
'You''ve been watching, haven''t you...'
EZEL
Quite intently.
I've seen the things you've done to
'"protect" this world from me...'

EZEL
Ironic that you'd seal me from devouring
the universe only to devour it yourself.
'It seems we''re BOTH monsters, hm?'

SEARINA
'...Was this a bad idea?'
ILLI
EZEL... what he was saying...
'It wasn''t true, was it?'
'He was lying, right?'
EZEL
'Oh, ILLI... don''t interrupt.'
It's time for dear VIDO's punishment.

SEARINA
'Ah, she''s eating him.'
He wasn't lying.
ILLI
No... but... he was tricking us...
He was supposed to be wrong...

ILLI
Haha... hahaha...
It's over.
'EZEL, I did it!'
SEARINA
Woah... ruthless.

EZEL
ILLI...

ILLI
You're really alive...!
EZEL
Thank you for freeing me
from my brother's seal.
I've missed you so much...
ILLI
I didn't think I'd get to speak to you
again like this...
'Hah, now I don''t know what to say...'
EZEL
'Dry your tears, darling.'
You've done well.

SEARINA
'...'
ILLI
Come on... I'll take you out of this
miserable place.

EZEL
'....'

SEARINA
Maybe ILLI's in danger...

SEARINA
'What do you think?'
Bones
'It''s up to you, whether or not you'
'listen to me... Whatever the conclusion,'
I've done all I can up to this point.
SEARINA
Right...
At least we stopped you.
SEARINA
'Your last words again?'
I don't know what I was expecting.
'...At least we stopped you.'

SEARINA
ILLI looked happy.
And I'm not in danger anymore.
SEARINA
So I'll consider this a job well done!

Uh... hey.
'', 0, 0, 2
'Are you really going to accept this ending?'
YEAH, HELL NO, 2
0, YEAH
'', 0, 0, 2
Suit yourself.


1, HELL NO

SEARINA
I shouldn't just LEAVE...

EZEL
'Ahh... hahah... thank you, ILLI.'
For wearing my brother down.
It made him much easier to stomach.

ILLI
'Where is this...?'
'Where have you taken us?'
EZEL
'What''s wrong, darling?'
'You aren''t afraid of my power, are you?'
'Or, would you like me to explain?'

EZEL
I learned a wonderful secret...
It was before I met you.
'Do you want to know about it?'

EZEL
'I learned that by consuming others,'
your own powers can grow exponentially...
'Isn''t that wonderful?'

EZEL
'Thanks to VIDO, I''m almost strong enough'
'to escape this boring, empty world.'
Hmhm... almost.

EZEL
ILLI... You've always been my favorite.
Come with me. I want to go farther than
anyone has ever gone.
ILLI
'What are you saying...?'
EZEL
The doll behind you.
I want you to eat her.
Then you'll understand.

ILLI
'Eat... her...?'
EZEL
Yes.
Make her power your own.

SEARINA
ILLI. I might be saying this entirely for
'self-preservation reasons, but...'
You don't want to eat me.

ILLI
But EZEL wants me... at her side...
SEARINA
'You''re really considering it?'
Even without a soul I can tell how
fucked up this whole thing is!
ILLI
I-I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...!
0, 6, false, false


ILLI
EZEL wants me... at her side...
SEARINA
'You''re really gonna obey her?'
Even without a soul I can tell how
fucked up this whole thing is!
ILLI
'...'
SEARINA
Ahh... I killed her.
'But, it was self defense.'
Really no getting around it.
EZEL
What a shame... if she can't even
'win against something like you,'
she was useless to me from the start.
EZEL
Doll.
'Do you have a name?'
SEARINA
It's SEARINA.

EZEL
SEARINA... would you like to join me
'on my journey to devour a new universe?'
SEARINA
'Are you going to eat me if I refuse?'

EZEL
I could do that...
Or leave you alone in this dying world.
The decision is yours.
SEARINA
Living in a dead world... that makes it
'sound like I might as well be dead, too.'
I choose survival!
!ruby/object:RPG::SE {name: her_laugh, pitch: 100, volume: 90
EZEL
'You''re smart, for something without a soul.'
We'll go far together. Hmhmhm...

EZEL
'Hmm...?'
'So you''ve chosen to disobey?'

ILLI
We have to stop you...
From escaping KAIMA.
From hurting anyone else.
EZEL
'Stop me...?'
'Oh, ILLI... what are you and'
'a soulless doll going to do to ME?'

SEARINA
Violent things!
I don't have a conscience holding me back.
Hope you're ready!!
ILLI
You're not my EZEL...
My EZEL was different...
I have to destroy the lie...!

SEARINA
This way is... really unsafe.
Not that this place seems any better.

SISTER
KAIMA has been restored somehow...
Albeit a little smaller than before.
'It''s thanks to you, isn''t it?'
SEARINA
I couldn't have done it without ILLI!
'The whole thing was a team effort, really.'
SISTER
'Then, give ILLI my thanks as well.'
I'm grateful that demons like you exist.

SISTER
My little brother really looks up to you.
I do as well.

BROTHER
'You saved the world, huh?'
'Will you be my new big sister?'
SEARINA
But we aren't related.
BROTHER
'So what? I wanna be!'
Gimme your hero DNA!!
SEARINA
It doesn't work like that!

BROTHER
I wanna be strong too...
'Strong and cool, like you are...'

COWGIRL
'One minute monsters were closin'' in on us,'
'the next, the world''s all back together...'
'I don''t really get it, but you did this, right?'
SEARINA
'Maybe, but ILLI helped too.'
Good job surviving 'til the end!
COWGIRL
A lotta my buddies tried fightin' VIDO
when the monsters first showed up...
You're the only ones to ever come back.
COWGIRL
Botha you deserve my respect.
'Hell, you''re stronger and braver'
than I ever was.
SEARINA
'Thanks, but...'
You probably shouldn't respect my bravery
when I can't feel fear in the first place.

COWGIRL
KAIMA's at peace again...
'Wonder who''ll be our new leaders?'
I'm votin' for you of course.

COWGIRL
'VIDO''s sorry, huh?'
Well he oughta be!
Good of him to say it though...

SEARINA
'Did we die?'
ILLI
I don't think so...
SEARINASOUL
'...'
SEARINA
Huh...

ILLI
EZEL is gone...
But KAIMA is safe now.
SEARINA
Yep! Which means...
No reason for you to cry anymore.
ILLI
'...Yeah.'
SEARINA
'Even though we just did something incredible,'
I don't really know anything about you.
Other than how you felt about EZEL.
ILLI
'I don''t know anything about you either,'
other than the fact you don't have a soul.
'...I don''t even remember your name.'
SEARINA
'Wow, that''s cold!'
0, 16, 0
ILLI
'When we first met, you stood and waited'
for one of VIDO's monsters to attack me.
SEARINA
'You remembered that, but not my name?'
ILLI
I'm saying you were the cold one.
SEARINA
This isn't fair!
I can't comprehend stuff like that!


SEARINA
'Hey, but that means... once I get my soul back,'
'you''ll know absolutely nothing about me?'
ILLI
You'll probably still be weird.
I'll know that much.
SEARINA
We'll see about that.

ILLI
EZEL was wrong...
The world isn't boring or empty.
She only made it that way.
SEARINA
'Yeah, it''s pretty colorful.'
'Actually, it looks like a mess!'
I can't remember if it was like this before.
ILLI
You might have an easier time remembering
if you took your soul back already.
'It''s here waiting for you, isn''t it?'
SEARINA
'Yeah but can''t I stay like this for a bit?'
You've never met me with my soul attached.
I'll be changed forever after that!
ILLI
If that stupid expression was your default...
Then I can already guess what
the complete version of you is like.
SEARINA
'You aren''t going to miss me are you?'
After all we've been through!
But I guess that's okay.

ILLI
KAIMA is going to need a new leader now.
Instead of princes and princesses...
maybe an overlord would be better.

ILLI
'VIDO apologized...?'
I guess I don't really care anymore.
I don't know what I should feel.

SEARINA
'Hey, it''s VIDO!'
You're as good at surviving as I am!
VIDOSOUL
You actually beat her...
Was it something only someone
'without a soul could accomplish...?'
SEARINA
'Uhh, maybe!'
ILLI helped though.
Sorry you ended up losing your body.
VIDOSOUL
No... someone who would readily sacrifice
other bodies doesn't deserve one of their own.
It's only fair I end up this way.
SEARINA
'If you''re fine with it, that''s great.'
Repent for all the trouble you caused!
'Though, I don''t really blame you for any of it.'
VIDOSOUL
Hmm... I wonder how you'd feel
if you weren't an empty vessel.
SEARINA
Guess we'll have to see about that!
Buuut I won't be able to hear you
once I reunite with my soul. Oh well.

VIDOSOUL
If this is the last you'll hear from me...
I suppose I should elaborate on my story.
VIDOSOUL
The monsters I used...
They're a magic ability I've had from birth.
'Consuming matter and souls, for energy...'
VIDOSOUL
'It''s a power I used sparingly,'
but enough to always remain above
my sister in terms of strength.
VIDOSOUL
Until... she discovered a way
to imitate that magic.
EZEL surpassed me exponentially.
VIDOSOUL
'I had to outdo her, out of necessity.'
She was nearly unstoppable...
you saw how many victims she took.
VIDOSOUL
'My methods were more removed,'
but as she said... no different from hers.
VIDOSOUL
I treated KAIMA's inhabitants like dolls.
'By sacrificing many, I could save the rest.'
I used that logic to justify my actions...
VIDOSOUL
Perhaps it was only a noble excuse
to save my own life from the start...
SEARINA
You sure like to talk a lot.
But I haven't heard an apology yet.
VIDOSOUL
'...'
I am truly sorry.
SEARINA
'Oh, good!'
I'll be sure to let everyone know.

VIDOSOUL
If I'm able to reincarnate in the future...
I promise never to cause
something like this again.

SEARINA
I came back to say your apology
received mixed reactions!
VIDOSOUL
Why did you go out of your way to...
'Actually, why have you done any of this?'
A soulless being shouldn't be this driven.
SEARINA
'Oh, I''m just at the mercy of'
'a higher power, that''s all.'
VIDOSOUL
'You''re aware of such a thing...?'
SEARINA
It's the only reasonable explanation!
VIDOSOUL
'...I see.'

VIDOSOUL
Anyway...
'Thank you, for everything.'

SEARINA
So you made it to the end too!
'This is some kind of miracle isn''t it?'
SEARINASOUL
Yeah. Everyone who got eaten up by
'the prince and princess, once they were freed,'
combined their power to make NEW KAIMA.
SEARINA
What a tidy conclusion!
SEARINASOUL
'A lot of lives were lost, but...'
you and ILLI saved us.
SEARINASOUL
Even without me you made the right decisions.
That's a relief.
SEARINA
'You were watching the whole time?'
'Heh, awkward.'
SEARINASOUL
I'd find out once we're back together anyway.
SEARINA
That's a good point.
'Should we go ahead and reunite now?'
SEARINASOUL
Hmm... out of respect for whoever or
'whatever is pulling your strings,'
we don't have to do it right away.
SEARINA
Roger that.
'I might go see how everyone''s doing, then.'

SEARINASOUL
'Are you done wandering around without me?'

PURPLE
Fighting... really does make a difference.
I thought I'd never see her again...
Thank you so much!

BULE
'You don''t know me, but I saw you save her.'
I can't thank you enough!

COMPOSIT
'Hey, can you help me?'
I thought I died...
But I can't really remember how...
SEARINA
'Amnesia, huh?'
'Well, you look a little familiar, but I don''t think'
'we''ve met, so I don''t know what to tell you.'
COMPOSIT
It's not amnesia.
'More like, my memories are contradictory.'
'Did I die for revenge, or to be a hero?'
SEARINA
'Maybe both?'
Guess the world reforming got you all mixed up.
COMPOSIT
'Reform...? That could be... yeah.'
KAIMA does look more patchworky than before.
'...Is that what happend to me, too?'
SEARINA
'Why are you asking me?'
'You''re alive now, so don''t worry about it.'

COMPOSIT
'Who am I...?'
This is so confusing...

COMPOSIT
'Prince VIDO says he''s sorry? Hmm...'
The manly thing to do is accept his apology.
But part of me is still angry about all this...

NEON
We're saved...
There's nothing to run away from anymore.
SEARINA
'Yeah, peace has been restored!'
It's the happy ending everyone wished for.
NEON
You've looked happy from the beginning...
I wish I had that kind of courage.
SEARINA
'Oh, I''m faking it.'
'But you should keep smiling, too.'
It might help you feel more courageous.

NEON
'So... you used my gift to reunite a family?'
Ah... I'm really glad...

NEON
'Prince VIDO apologized...?'
In that case... I forgive him.
'Things are fine now, after all.'

GREY
So... I'm corporeal again.
'But now that people might try talking to me,'
I kinda wish I could've stayed invisible.
SEARINA
'...'
GREY
Ahh... thanks for seeing right through me.
Making conversation is too much pressure.

GREY
I don't know if losing my body
made my anxiety better or worse...
'Oh, I have to relearn to stop thinking aloud.'

SEARINA
'Oh, it''s a music box.'
