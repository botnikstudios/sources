  It sounds like you're doing some pretty

  You're awesome! You're...the man, man!

  You can probably tell that I had no idea
  what to write, but hey, I figured the

  a letter of encouragement.
  So... Yay, man, yay!
  Go, man, go! Go! Go!
  Never give up! Never lose hope!

  And while I don't make much, I'm sending
  you the wages I've earned lately. Just
  doing my part! Hope it helps!

If you start wandering around a place as
well-guarded as that without any means of
defense, you're bound to get caught!

At the very least, you should see if there's
anything nearby that you can use to [red]hide
yourself [white]with! Think stealth!

See what you can find around there, and be
quick about it! Time is short!"





"Are you planning on spending the rest of
your life in there?!


Look around! I'd be surprised if a run-down
cell like that didn't have a hole or two that
you could use to worm your way out!"





"Ah-hah! I've got it, [player]!



In order to reach the top of the tower where
your sister's being held, you'll have to find
the room right below the tower. The path to
the tower begins in [red]the rear of that room[white]!
You got that?"





"Those [red]searchlights[white] are a real pain, huh?



You're going to have to deal with them
somehow, I'm afraid...


There's got to be a way to get up to where
those searchlights are. Look around and see
what you can find, OK?"





"Listen up, [player]...
There's a monster running the searchlight
up there!

If you can slay the monster, then just
maybe it'll shut the searchlight down.


Oh...but you're unarmed, aren't you?
All you have is a [red]shield[white]... 


If I were you, I'd try to use my [red]shield [white]to
deflect the monster's blows and see if I
could make it [red]drop its weapon[white]. If you did
that, you could pick up its weapon with [a].
...But that's just me. What'll you do?"





"What's the matter!? The room your sister's
in is just up ahead...


Look carefully at the [red]tower wall[white]. Isn't there
a [red]narrow ledge[white] you can cross?

Face the wall and press [a] to sidle along
the wall. You should be able to get across
the ledge...as long as you're careful.

Just remember, you can't do anything else
while you're sidling, so you have to be
extra-careful of what's around you!"





"Heh heh... I slipped this stone into your
pocket just before we fired you over there.
It's no ordinary stone, either.

I can see what you're doing through this
stone, and obviously you can hear me
through it. So...if you see [flashing_a],
you'd better press that button!
I've put the stone on your [red]Quest Status
screen[white]. Press [red]START[white] and use [l] or [r] to
scroll around. It's pretty basic.

Hey, but listen carefully! I need this back
after you save your sister, so don't go
losing it, you understand?!"





"Ah, now I remember...



I was eating [red]shrimp[white] last night...
Heh heh heh..."





"Warp to [red]this area[white]?"





"There is no wind for you to conduct."





"You can only call up cyclones when you
are in your boat on the sea."





"All right, [player]...
I'll need you to listen to me for a moment.


The item you seek is hidden somewhere in
this [red]castle[white]. To find it, you must find the
[red]entrance[white] to the basement.

But...that entrance has been blocked by a
mighty threshold, firmly sealed to prevent
evil from ever gaining access.

Do you know where to search and what you
must do to open the hidden way?


You will find a clue in the [red]shape of the
herald[white] near where we arrived at the castle."





"Excellent, [player]. To perceive such
a puzzle and decipher it is no small feat.


Now, take the sword that lies before you.



It is none other than the [red]Master Sword[white]...
The blade of evil's bane.


It is the only sword that can banish
Ganon from the world above!"





"[player]! We must return to the
surface!


Return to me, quickly!"





"Long ago, there existed a kingdom where
a golden power lay hidden."





"It was a prosperous land blessed with green
forests, tall mountains, and peace."





"But one day a man of great evil found the
golden power and took it for himself..."





"With its strength at his command, he
spread darkness across the kingdom."





"But then, when all hope had died, and the
hour of doom seemed at hand..."





"...a young boy clothed in green appeared
as if from nowhere."





"Wielding the blade of evil's bane, he sealed
the dark one away and gave the land light."





"This boy, who traveled through time to save
the land, was known as the Hero of Time."





"The boy's tale was passed down through
generations until it became legend..."





"But then...a day came when a fell wind
began to blow across the kingdom."





"The great evil that all thought had
been forever sealed away by the hero..."





"...once again crept forth from the depths of
the earth, eager to resume its dark designs."





"The people believed that the Hero of Time
would again come to save them."





"...But the hero did not appear."





"Faced by an onslaught of evil, the people
could do nothing but appeal to the gods."





"In their last hour, as doom drew nigh, they
left their future in the hands of fate."





"What became of that kingdom...?
None remain who know."





"The memory of the kingdom vanished, but
its legend survived on the wind's breath."





"On a certain island, it became customary to
garb boys in green when they came of age."





"Clothed in the green of fields, they aspired
to find heroic blades and cast down evil."





"The elders wished only for the youths to
know courage like the hero of legend..."





"An evil power seems to have blocked the
effects of the music you conducted!"





"There is nothing nearby that you can
control."





"Conduct with [c_stick].
Change rhythm with [left_arrow][control_stick_left_right][right_arrow]."





"You conducted the [red]Wind's Requiem[white]!"





"You conducted the [red]Ballad of Gales[white]!"





"You conducted the [red]Command Melody[white]!"





"You conducted the [red]Earth God's Lyric[white]!"





"You conducted the [red]Wind God's Aria[white]!"





"You conducted the [red]Song of Passing[white]!"





"Conduct with [c_stick].
Change rhythm with [left_arrow][control_stick_left_right][right_arrow]."





"[sound=10]It is too dangerous to go any further
in this direction! We must turn back!"





"Did you get a [red]sail[white]?



There is no time to lose!
You must find one, quickly!"





"Why do you hesitate so?
Quickly, come next to me and then
[red]press [white][a] to climb in."





"[sound=265]Oh! That look in your eye... So, you've
found yourself a sail, have you?


Very well! Then I shall teach you the
[red]art of sailing[white]!"





"Come next to my hull and press [a] to
climb aboard.


Set the [red]sail[white] you got to [y], [z], or [x],
and press that same button to hoist it.


The sail will catch the wind, which will
push the boat forward. The [yellow][up_arrow][white] that
appears behind me indicates [red]wind direction[white].

Use [control_stick] to steer. If you wish to move
quickly, you should keep the wind blowing
directly into the sail. You can always
press [a] to [red]put away [white]the sail.
Try it when you want to [red]adjust your speed[white]."





"Did you understand all that?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"I see... Then allow me to explain again.
"





"Ah! One more thing. When you are out at
sea with few landmarks to go by, you will
be at the mercy of your [red]Sea Chart[white].

I have marked the place we should
currently be heading for on your Sea Chart.


If you get lost at sea, simply press [d_pad][up_arrow]
to open the chart and confirm your position.


Now! A westerly wind blows! Hop in and
let it carry us to the [red]east[white]!"





"There! On the horizon!



That is our destination, [player]...
[red]Dragon Roost Island[white]!"





"High atop this island's peak lives the
[red]spirit of the skies[white]...a great dragon by the
name of [red]Valoo[white]."





"You must go see this dragon and request
from him a jewel called [red]Din's Pearl[white]."





"Ask the people of the [red]Rito tribe [white]who inhabit
this island about how to see the dragon."





"Oh, I almost forgot! Wait just a moment!"





"This island has been a calm and peaceful
place for as long as I have known it.


What could have happened to it?"





"Ask the winged Rito tribespeople about the
sky spirit, [red]Valoo[white].


We cannot set sail again until you have
the [red]pearl[white]."





"It would seem that Ganon sent those
monsters to this place.


But that would mean..."





"There is no time to lose! We must depart at
once for the place where the next [red]pearl
[white]sleeps! We sail [red]to the south[white]!"





"The wind is blowing to the [red]south[white]! Quickly!
Swim beside me and press [a] to climb
aboard! We must depart at once for the
place where the next [red]pearl[white] lies sleeping!"





"...Unfortunately, we cannot depart until the
wind blows to the [red]south[white].


It would be a fatal mistake to set sail
under an unstable breeze.


I have heard legends that tell of a [red]wind god
[white]who once resided on this island...

Have you heard nothing of him?"





"Yes! Do you not see what rises up from
the horizon?


That is where you must go, [player]...
the [red]Forest Haven[white]."





"It may appear as though this is but a great
tree rising far above the ocean's surface...


But it is a sacred place. It is inside this
grotto that you will find the [red]spirit of the
earth[white], the [red]Great Deku Tree[white]."





"You must speak with the [red]Deku Tree[white] and
receive from him the sacred gem known as
[red]Farore's Pearl[white]."





"I fear that Ganon's vile hand may have
already reached this most sacred of
sanctuaries.

Go forth with caution, [player]."





"Around the Forest Haven there were once
many lush islands that were home to
throngs of forest fairies...

When did this place become so barren
and sad?"





"Could those withered islands be...



[player]! You must hurry to the [red]Deku
Tree[white] and ask him for his [red]sacred pearl[white]!"





"So this place, too, has been attacked by
Ganon. Could he already be regaining
his power?"





"[player], you must get the remaining
pearl! It lies in a place northwest of here.


We must set sail immediately!"





"What are you doing?



I have marked our next destination on your
Sea Chart.


We have no time to delay here!"





"You can change the direction of the wind
from aboard my deck.


If you get lost out on the sea, just check
your Sea Chart and [red]change the wind [white]so it
blows toward your destination."





"Look, [player]! Do you see it?



...What has happened to this place?



............."





"[sound=266]Wh-What is the meaning of this?
The island... It is..."





"...We are too late.



I knew we had precious little time, but I
never suspected how little...


A great [red]water spirit[white] named [red]Jabun[white] once lived
here, but no sign of him remains..."





"[sound=260][size=150]Ho, there! [player]!"





"So, you're here! I've been looking for you!



Are you by chance seeking the great
spirit, [red]Jabun[white]?


I'm sorry to report to you that Jabun can
no longer be found here."





"Just look at how this place has been torn
to pieces... I suppose this, too, is the work
of the shadow in Forsaken Fortress.

But fear not! Jabun was able to flee this
island before it was attacked. He is in a
safer abode now.

Would you like to guess where that abode
may be?"





"...On the island where you were born.


On Outset."





"Yet even if you were to go to Outset now,
you would not be able to see Jabun.


The cave where he hides is sealed with a
mighty stone slab that repels all who try
to pass it. Why, not even the pirates with
their mighty ship could get in..."





"...I must apologize, [player].
I thought if anyone would know of your
whereabouts, it would be the pirates.

I told them this tale without so much as
a thought for the consequences.


I don't know what they hoped to get, but
they immediately set sail for Outset Island
and tried to break into the cave."





"...It is lucky they could not gain entrance.
I have heard that they were last spotted
on [red]Windfall Island[white], but doing what, I do
not know.
If you wish to see Jabun, I think you'd
better search for the pirates on [red]Windfall
Island[white]."





"What an eerie isle this is... Everywhere else
boasts clear skies and calm seas, but this
place suffers under dark clouds and rain."





"Valoo must have been right when he asked
me to bring word of Jabun to you...


He called this island [red]cursed[white]..."





"I would counsel against staying here
longer than you have to.


...But that is your decision. I have told you
of Jabun, so my task is complete!"





"So, Jabun has survived!



The sea spirit has lived through the trials
of many long years. He must have caught
wind of Ganon's attack beforehand...

If we are to believe the words of the Rito
postman, then the [red]pirates[white] know something
about the cave where Jabun hides.

Why don't we go first to [red]Windfall[white] and
search for them there?"





"What is the matter? Have you forgotten
where [red]Windfall Island [white]lies?


If you have, then check your Sea Chart."





"It is too soon for us to venture in this
direction. We should sail directly to our
[red]next destination[white]."





"Beyond here is outside the bounds of the
course. We must not stray out-of-bounds!"





"[player]...
You must remember well the appearance
of this room.

[red]The shape of the floor[white]... [red]The number of
items hanging on the walls[white]...
Such things are the keys to solving the
riddles that lie ahead.
Do not overlook anything!"





"Closed all night for pirate party."





"Sorry, but I'm asleep. Please don't bother
me until after nightfall. Thank you!"





"I've been waiting for you, [player].



[sound=167][player]...
[wait=60]Try these on."





"Time certainly flies... I can't believe you're
already old enough to wear these clothes."





"Don't look so disappointed, dear one!
Just try them on.


Today is a day to celebrate! It is the day
that you become the same age as the young
hero spoken of in all the legends.

You only have to wear them for one day, so
don't look so down. Be proud, child!"





"In the olden days, this was the day boys
were finally considered to be men. They
were taught the ways of the sword to
prepare them for battle with their enemies."





"Hanging the family [red]shield [white]on the wall as
decoration is another tradition that has
been carried down from those days."





"Does all this make sense to you?"





"Isn't that nice, [player]? They suit
you perfectly! A perfect fit!


Well, tonight I'm going to invite the whole
town over for your birthday party, so I'd
better start getting ready, shouldn't I?

Your grandma is going to make your
favorite soup for you tonight! Mmmm!


I just know you're looking forward to it!



Now, go get your sister, [red]Aryll[white]."





"What is it, [player]?



Go call Aryll for me!"





"But we don't live in such an age any
longer... Our ways are the ways of peace.


Nowadays, I suppose [red]Orca[white] is the only one
on the island who still knows anything
about [red]swordplay[white]."





"[animation=12][wait=45]You always wear the same outfit...
[animation=13]I think you need a new look..."





"Hoo hoo hoooooooooo![wait=30] If my appearance
[wait=30]does not surprise you...
[wait=30]Then you, sir,[wait=30] must be a fairy, just
like Tingle!"





"[size=75]Blue clothes...and a crawfish design?"





"I've been waiting for you, [player].



[sound=167]Here you are, [player].
[wait=60]Try these on!


These are special clothes...made of a
special fabric that only the honest can see!"





"What's the matter? Why the long face?
You CAN see them, can't you? Hm hm hm...


Well, today is the day we commemorate
the fact that you've reached the same age
as the hero of the legends! You have to be
proud about that for at least one day!
Put them on and see if you can't fool
anybody in town!"





"Wow! You really DO have [blue]blue clothes[white]...
with a picture of a crawfish on them!


You're [player], right?"

"[player], have you seen your sister,
Aryll, this morning?"





"I wouldn't be surprised if she's climbed up
to her favorite spot to play with the gulls
again today.

I've always thought it quite odd...
She's the only person I know who the wild
gulls will even approach."





"With the power you have now, you can
neither lift nor destroy that stone.


And yet, somewhere on this sea, the power
to do so lies waiting for one to find it.


You must seek it out."

What's happened?"





"Where is Aryll?



I know she's a good girl who behaves
herself, but she's still just a child.
You mustn't let your eyes off of her."





"Why, what are you doing with such a
dangerous thing? That's no toy!
[wait=30]What's happened?"





"[player], what is that thing you
have on your back?"

wrong? Is it something you can't even
tell your grandma?"





"What is it, [player]? Please...
Tell Grandma what's troubling you."





"And where's Aryll...? Is she still
playing outside with the gulls?"

Oh, you're such a sweet child..."

You and your sister, Aryll, are trying so
hard to be strong, and I've just been
sitting here, moaning and worrying...

I'm your grandmother... I'm the one who

I'm so sorry, [player]. I haven't even
considered what you must be going
through. I'm a terrible grandma..."

No, thank you"

But you do know you can ask me for
some whenever you like, don't you?"





"Whenever you have an [red]empty [white]bottle, you
just bring it straight to Grandma.
I can make more soup for you whenever
you like!"

"Oh, [player]! Happy birthday!



[wait=10]Hey, did your sister, Aryll, find you?
She was supposed to tell you that your
grandmother is looking for you.

[wait=30]Speaking of your sister, [wait=6]she saw me at work
the other day, and she said she wanted to
learn to carry jars on her head like me so
she could help your grandma with chores.
So...if you see her, tell her that all
she has to do is stand [red]in front of a jar
[white]and press [a] to carry it. To put the
jar down, she just has to press [r]!
Can you tell her that for me?"





"The secret to lifting jars is to stand in
front of them and press [a].
And don't forget to tell Aryll to set
jars down with [r], OK?"





"What was that noise!? It was awful!
You'd better return home quickly...
A sound like that can only mean trouble!

You know what I'd do if trouble came my
way? I'd throw rocks to fight it off!
You could handle that, couldn't you?

It's easy! Just stand in front of a rock and
press [a] to lift it. Press [a] again to throw
it. If you just want to set the rock back
down, press [r].
[draw_instant]Do you understand?[draw_char]"





"To lift a rock, stand in front of it and
press [a]. When you want to throw, press
[a] again. Press [r] to set it down.
Couldn't be easier!"





"[player], I thought I heard Aryll's
voice cry from far away...
[wait=30][draw_instant]Is it...[draw_char] [wait=10][draw_instant]Is it really true?[draw_char]"





"What kind of weird boat is that?"





"...That's just terrible! My precious jars...
[wait=10][draw_instant]How could you?[draw_char]"





"That's just awful..."





"[draw_instant]Oh,[draw_char][wait=30] that was fine...
[draw_instant]It won't do. [draw_char][wait=10][draw_instant]It won't do.[draw_char]"





"[draw_instant]Oh,[draw_char][wait=10] that's right!
[draw_instant]I knew I forgot something.[draw_char][draw_instant]
Yes,[draw_char] I'd better head back."





"Is... Is that you, [player]?



Well, looks as though you're safe...
[wait=30]That's good to know."





"Your grandmother has been having a
terrible time of it ever since you left.


She rarely leaves the house, and as far as I
can tell, she just spends her days sleeping.
She hardly eats...

I've actually come here to see if my old
grandpa knows of any medicine or anything
that might make her feel better."





"The island has really taken a turn for the
worse since you left.


I'm sure you noticed them... The monsters...
Those horrible creatures... They rampage
through town every night after dark.

I'm scared... Too scared..."





"Ever since you left, our lovely island has
become a horrible place to live. 


Every night now, when the sun disappears,
vile monsters appear and tear across the
island, causing havoc.

It's frightening... So frightening..."





"Your poor old grandmother...
Her days are spent in worry, and her nights
are filled with horrific nightmares...

I've tried to give her medicine to help
her feel better, but she just can't seem
to drink it...

I don't know what to do..."





"[player]? Are you all right?



Our island is a dangerous place now.
You shouldn't stay outside long!"





"Monsters have begun appearing in town at
night. It's awful out there! You really
should go home while you can. Who else is
going to protect your grandmother?"





"Oh, [player].



Hey, congrats! I'm really looking forward
to tonight, buddy! We're gonna party!


But...are you really that old already?
[wait=30]Wow! Time just flies right by, huh?!
[wait=30]It never ceases to amaze me.

I mean, for example, I swear I just cut the
grass in this field the other day, [wait=30]but look
at how tall it's gotten! Ah, well...
The mysteries of time and grass..."





"Say, do you want to try cutting it, too,
[player]? You'd be surprised at the
[red]things people drop in the grass[white]. It's
like hunting for treasure!
Except... Without some kind of grass-cutting
tool, you can't cut the grass. Sorry, buddy."





"I can't just let this field be, you know.
[wait=30]If I did, the weeds would take control!"





"Cutting grass is hard work, but it pays off!
People leave [red]the darnedest things [white]in the
grass, so if you go to the trouble of cutting
it, you get to keep whatever you find."





"Did you hear that noise, [player]?
Did something happen? What was it?"





"Oh, say! That's a fine sword you have
there, buddy! Just look at that thing!


You know, you'd be doing me a big favor
if you'd cut this here grass for me."





"Sometimes you can [red]find things[white] in the
grass when you cut it, [wait=30]so it isn't always a
thankless chore! It pays, buddy!"





"Eh? [player]? Is that you,
[player]? Whoa.


You kind of startled me there, buddy. I
thought more of those monsters had come
to harass me."





"I tell you, there have been a lot of strange
things going on here at night lately. I
haven't gotten a good night's sleep in ages
because of it! And I love sleep!"





"In fact, I saw something really odd just a
little while ago. Of course, this was back
before the bridge was destroyed...

It was up in the [red]Fairy Woods[white], near the old
dried-up fountain. I saw this [red]tall girl [white]who
glowed like a fairy, which was odd enough,
but then she vanished [red]into that rock[white]...
Really! I saw it with my own eyes!"





"There have been strange things going on at
night, I tell you! It's turned my whole
schedule upside-down. Now I'm up all night
and asleep in bed all day..."





"Awww... I just want to cut the grass..."





"I wonder what that was all about...
That [red]fairy-looking[white] girl I saw up there
by the [red]big stone[white]..."





"[player]! Is that you? If I recall
correctly, today, you are the same age as
the legendary hero.

When did you get so old?



You must build strong muscles from now on!
Strong muscles!"





"You have come at the perfect moment!
I was just trying my [red]rolling attack[white].
Allow me to teach it to you!"





"Are you ready? Just run as fast as you
can, then press [a]. That is how you
perform a [red]rolling attack[white].

If you think you understand, then try to roll
into the wall. Go on, young one!"





"Did you hear me, [player]? Run as
fast as you can and press [a] to perform
a [red]rolling attack[white]. Try rolling into the wall."





"[sound=3]Oh! What is the matter, [player]?
You have an urgent look about you...
Has something happened?"





"Whatever it is, from the look on your face
I suspect it is no laughing matter...

[wait=30]What say you, [player]?"





"Do you wish to practice your skills with
the sword?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"[sound=4]Do not begrudge the effort required to
build strength. If you change your mind,
come see me. I will be happy to train you."





"Very good! Your first lesson shall be the
[red]horizontal slice[white]!
Face me and press [b]. Do not fear for my
safety... I am ready for you!"





"Very good. Next is the [red]vertical slice[white]!
Hold [l] to [red]target[white] me, then press [b]!"





"Very good! Next is the [red]thrust[white]!
[red][l]-target[white], then tilt [control_stick_up] [up_arrow] and press [b].
Come at me! Thrust with your sword!"





"Very good! Now finally, the [red]jump attack[white]!
Draw your sword, [l][red]-target[white], and press [a]!"





"[sound=5][draw_instant]That was a fine display![draw_char]"





"You still have much to learn, but the skill
to become a master is in your veins. Do not
neglect your practice!"





"[sound=6]Wrong! Press [red]only [white][b]!"





"[sound=6][red][l]-target[white] and press [b] to perform a
[red]vertical slice[white]!"





"[sound=6]You [red]thrust [white]by [red][l]-targeting[white], tilting
[control_stick_up] [up_arrow], and pressing [b]."





"[sound=6]You must perform a [red]jump attack[white]! Draw your
blade, [red][l]-target,[white] and press [a]."





"[sound=3]What say you?"





"[draw_instant]Such a racket! Can't you keep quiet!?[draw_char]
[wait=30]You've knocked everything off my
shelves, you dratted hooligan!"





"Ah! My brother upstairs is very high-strung.
His is the way of knowledge. He locks
himself in his room and studies all day.

He is quite wise, but with that big head of
his, he is hardly...accommodating.


On top of it all, he is so very feeble! At
times, I am ashamed to call him my brother."





"But enough of that, [player]! I sense
the natural talent that beats in your veins.


But you need more than talent to make it
in the world today. You must also be bold!
And to that end, I shall teach you the art
of swordplay.
What say you?"





"I am sure you can master the sword quickly,
as well!

What say you?"





"From now on, [player], you must
train your body constantly!"





"Press [a] while running to do a
[red]rolling attack[white]! [red][l]-target[white] and press [a] while
tilting [control_stick_left_right] [left_arrow] or [right_arrow] to jump.

Ah, yes! And remember, to do a [red]back-flip[white],
just tilt [control_stick_down] [down_arrow] and press [a]."





"You should practice daily from now on.



By the way, [player], might you be
interested in learning the art of fencing?

What say you?"





"Press [a] while running to perform a
[red]rolling attack[white]. [red][l]-target[white] and press [a] while
tilting [control_stick_left_right] [left_arrow] or [right_arrow] to [red]jump[white].

Tilt [control_stick_down] [down_arrow] and press [a] to do a [red]back-flip[white].
Do not forget these things."





"Good! ...Keep coming at me until you hear
me say \"Very good!\""





"Keep swinging!"





"Very good! Keep thrusting!"





"Next is the [red]spin attack[white]![red] Hold[white] [b] [red]briefly[white] to
build up your strength, then release it!
[draw_instant](Or rotate [control_stick] once and press [b].)[draw_char]"





"[sound=6][red]Hold [white][b] [red]briefly and release it [white]to do a
[red]spin attack[white]! (Or rotate [control_stick] once and tap [b].)"





"Very good! More! Keep it up!"





"Come at me once more!"





"Next is harder! This is a [red]parry attack[white].
[red][l]-target[white] until you see [flashing_a], then quickly
press [a] to perform a defensive strike!"





"Very good! And again! [red][l]-target[white] and watch
closely for [flashing_a]!"





"No! You can only perform a [red]parry[white] by
[red][l]-targeting[white] and pressing [a] when
you see the [flashing_a]!"





"Ah? [player]? You are all right!"





"Why did you not tell me about Aryll?
[wait=30]That was thoughtless of you..."





"This island has seen hard times ever
since you departed..."





"Hmm... I do not know what you have been
doing on your journey, but you seem a little
more daring these days.

That look in your eye is not the one you
left here with."





"Very good! Show me just how much you've
improved your sword skills!
[two_choices]OK
Not now"





"If I must say so, your skills with the
sword are still at the level of a [red]page[white]!"





"Very good! Try to hit me [red]100 times or more[white]
before I hit you [red]three times[white]!"





"Very good, [red]knight[white]!"





"Now, try to hit me [red]300 times[white] before I hit
you [red]three times[white]!"





"You are still at the level of [red]swordsman
[white]when it comes to your sword skills."





"If you want to be a true master, you
must hit me [red]500 times[white] before I hit you
[red]three times[white]!"





"Are you happy just being a swordsman?
Surely you can do better than that!"





"Keep coming at me until I hit you
[red]three times[white]!"





"Do not hold back, Master [player]."





"Come at me as if I were your fiercest enemy!"





"This is all I can do for you, I am afraid!
Of course, I will always be happy to face
off against you..."





"Enough!"





"You couldn't pierce my defenses even [red]once[white]...
What a poor showing. You must remember...
[wait=30]As you grow stronger in your skills,
others may grow stronger as well!"





"You may come here to practice as often as
you like. I will always be happy to face off
against you."





"[red][orca_blow_count][white], eh...?
[wait=0]Remember, though you may grow in
strength, others grow stronger as well!"





"Ah! [red][orca_blow_count][white]! You have improved!"





"I guess it was wrong of me to treat you
like you were still a lowly [red]page[white].
You are a [red]page[white] no more!

Now you are a [red]knight[white]!"





"Knight! It is not much, but it is now
yours! Take this with you!"





"It was wrong of me to treat you like a
child. From now on, you have my respect.


I shall call you [red]swordsman[white]!"





"Swordsman! You will likely need something
like this in your travels... Take it."





"You have already become a fine [red]swordsman[white].
But I am certain you can do even better!"





"[player], take this!"





"Impressive, [player]! I lost count of
how many times you struck me!"





"You have learned all I have to teach,
Master [player]!"





"Master! It is not much to speak of, but
please, take this."





"Ah. How...pleasant. My arm feels numb.



Master, is your left index finger not numb,
as well?"





"Master! Please, take this."





"Ah. How...pleasant. My arm feels numb.


Master, is your left index finger not numb?"





"Impressive, Master [player]!"





"This is thanks for giving me a good lesson!"





"I have learned much."





"Ah. We have not met for some time."





"Do you wish to fight me again?
What say you, [player]?
[two_choices]Sure
No thanks"





"It has been some time since I last saw you,
Master."





"Shall we, [player]?
[two_choices]Sure
No thanks"





"Wh-[wait=20]Why, that is...[wait=20][draw_instant]a [red]Knight's Crest[white]![draw_char]"





"How many of those do you have?"





"Hmph!



Then I suppose the time has come for me to
speak to you about the crests..."





"The [red]Knight's Crest[white]...[wait=20]
It is the symbol of a courageous knight...


But not just anyone can gather them...
No! It takes a soul who possesses not only
power, but wisdom and courage as well!

Any courageous soul who gathers ten of
these crests can learn a powerful new
[red]sword technique[white]!"





"Both my brother and I dreamt of learning
this technique in our youth. We worked so
hard to collect the crests...

But it took many long years and adventures
beyond count before we even approached
finding ten of them, and we both grew old..."





"It appears you have enough might to learn
that technique now."





"Perhaps, just perhaps, you can master it!



Very good, [player]!
Heed my words!"





"[draw_instant]Hold [b] to build up power, then release it![draw_char]
[wait=60]Come at me, now! Do it!"





"Hold [b] to build up your power! Then
release it! Heed me! Try it again!"





"[player]! Where are you going!?
Hold [b] to build up your power,
then release it!"





"Amazing, [player]! You did it! You
have mastered the [red]Hurricane Spin[white]!


[wait_dismiss_prompt=90]
At last, you have made our long-held dream
come true![wait_dismiss=90]"





"Oh, the joyful tears... They won't stop...



I thought my tears had dried up long ago."





"There is nothing left for me to teach you!



I am certain now that you will save your
sister, Aryll, and bring her home to Outset!"





"[wait=10]...



Come see me once you have collected [red]ten[white] of
the [red]Knight's Crests[white]!
Then I can teach you what they are for!"





"I have nothing left to teach you!



I am certain you will save your sister,
Aryll, and return with her to Outset!"





"'Hoy! [player]! Press [l] right there
and use [a] to talk to me! Try it!"





"That's correct. You're a smart one!"





"You, my friend, have just [red][l]-targeted[white] me.
You see, when you press [l], you can target
certain objects. I, for one, use it quite often
to talk to folks who are far away from me.
Of course, even if there isn't anything
around to target, you can press [l] to face
forward, you know. It's quite handy, indeed.

There are a myriad of other ways to use
[red][l]-targeting[white], as well. Quite an ingenious
little thing, if I do say so myself!"





"Of course, that's not the only trick in my
bag. Not remotely! I can teach you a few
more things if you'll just climb up that
[red]ladder[white] over there and drop by my room."





"That [red][l]-targeting[white] you just did has a
wide range of uses, my boy! Most certainly!


For instance, you can use it to talk to
far-off people, or if there isn't anyone to
target, you can use it to face forward
quickly. It's quite ingenious, I should say!"





"If you desire the benefits of my wisdom, I
can teach you many other things. Just climb
up that [red]ladder[white] over there and come see me
in my room for some expert tutelage."





"You're growing up, [player], which
means you're going to need as much wisdom
as you can get from this point forward!

And if you want to be wise, you must first
know things! 


Now, I was born before you, so I know all
sorts of things. Yes, I've been studying
all manner of topics for many years now.

Now, I can tell you're a smart lad...



Lately, I've been thinking it's time for me to
pass some of my wisdom down, and I think
you're the one I'm going to pass it down
to... Count yourself lucky, lad!"





"Everything that you see tacked to the walls
here is something that I've researched
thoroughly. And before you ask, yes,
I do know my filing system is odd.
Organizational issues aside, however, it's
all extremely useful information. You would
do well to read it all very carefully.
Reading leads to knowing, you know!"





"[draw_instant]Such a racket! Can't you keep quiet!?[draw_char]
[wait=30]You've knocked everything off my
shelves, you dratted hooligan!"





"[wait=60]Honestly! The hooligan I'm referring to
is my younger and much less intelligent
brother, who lives just downstairs...

He hates studying. All day, every day, the
lout just exercises and practices with his
weapons. Does he exercise his brain? No!
The brain's a muscle, too! ...I think.
Anyway, the only thing he DOES study is
the art of fighting. Right now, for instance,
he's been studying [red]fencing [white]and whatnot. As
if that's of any use to anyone...
He simply doesn't know how to do anything
besides exercise. I ask you, what's a
brother to do?"





"You're a smart lad, [player].



You'll find that everything I've written down
and tacked to my walls will be very useful
in life. A lifetime of knowledge, all for you!

You just be sure to take the time to read it
all through very carefully.


If you don't, you'll surely end up like that
useless hooligan of a little brother of mine
who lives downstairs."





"Oh! [player]? You've come back!
And in one piece, too! Gracious!"





"My granddaughter tells me that your
grandmother is in poor health these days...


Now, I'm certain that a little [red]fairy[white] dust
would provide all the lift her spirits need,
but... Well, the problem is, I haven't seen
any [red]fairies[white] in these parts recently.
Of course, long ago you could find a lot of
them up by the old [red]Fairy Fountain[white], and
you could even capture them in [red]empty
bottles[white]. Sure! It was easy as you please!
Yes, there was a time when I used to like
playing with fairies... Uh...ahem! In any
case, ever since the fountain was blocked
up by that [red]huge rock[white], I haven't seen a one..."





"I tell you, my boy, this island has seen
more than its share of trouble lately.


Night after night, monsters appear in town.
The fiends! They come to ravage our
peaceful little island. Why? None know.

And yet...it seems they don't desire to do
harm to us villagers... It's quite puzzling,
even for my larger-than-average intellect."





"The island has fallen on hard times
lately, my young lad.


You must have noticed all the monsters
on your way here tonight. They come after
dark to ravage our poor little village.

And yet...it seems they are not here to
harm us villagers... Quite puzzling."





"Before the [red]Fairy Fountain[white] was plugged by
that [red]rock[white], you could always find fairies
there. In fact, long ago, I used to put them
in [red]empty bottles[white] and play with them.
I don't see many fairies these days, though.
It's sad, how life's little pleasures have
a way of slipping through the cracks of
time, isn't it? Ah, well.
In any case, your grandmother will need
some [red]fairy[white] dust if she is to get better.


Then again, I suppose seeing you and Aryll
safe and happy again is more important to
her than anything else!"





"The monsters appear night after night
and rampage across the island.


What could they possibly want here?"





"Did you see them? They come every night
after dark. What could they want here?"





"Wh-Why, that's a [red]Swordsman's Crest[white]!



Have you already shown that to my
[red]brother[white] downstairs?"





"[size=75]Must you show it off like that...?"





"If you want to know what that thing is,
ask my [red]brother[white] downstairs."





"I just saw a [red]wild[white]...a [red]wild pig[white]!
[wait=30]Ooh! See? Look! That black one there...
[wait=30]Don't you see him?

[wait=10]This is perfect! My wife was just telling
me how she really wanted a pet...


You ready to go grab it, [player]?
[wait=30]Now, you can't just run up on it!
Pigs are too alert about their surroundings
for you to just jog up and capture one.
If you want to get close to one, you have to
hold [r] to crouch and tilt [control_stick] to crawl
slowly up behind it. [wait=30]Slow[wait=30]ly...

You could also distract it with bait,
I guess."





"Remember, you can't frighten those oinkers!
Hold [r] to crouch and use [control_stick] to [wait=30]slow[wait=30]ly[wait=20]
crawl up behind them. And then POUNCE!!!
...Or you could just give them [red]bait[white]."





"If you come across wild pigs, you've got to
be careful not to scare them. What you
need to do is open your heart to them.
...Yeah, you heard me right!
For example, you can feed them bait to
settle them down, or hold [r] and use [control_stick] to
slowly crawl up behind them. That way,
you won't startle them and they'll like you.
Oh, and remember to [red]put away [white]anything
you're holding before you press [r] to
crouch. You can't go crawling around with
stuff in your hands!"





"Wild animals scare easily. Just trust me on
this one, all right?


The secret is to put them at ease by
feeding them bait. Or you can press
[r] and use [control_stick] to sneak up on them.

Just remember to [red]put away[white] anything you
have in your hand before you press [r]
to crouch."





"[player], your sister, Aryll... She's...



[draw_instant]Don't tell me... [draw_char][wait=20][draw_instant]You're not going to board
that ship[draw_char][wait=20] and try to save her, are you?"





"Listen, I can imagine how you must feel...
but think about it for a second!


Setting out like this means many long hours
of toil and hardship lie ahead of you.


Are you really prepared to see this quest
all the way through to the end, without
giving up halfway through, [player]?!"





"Oh! [player]! You made it back!"





"Nasty things have been happening here at
night ever since you left on that boat...


You'd better head home early today...
And don't come out to play until long
after the sun has risen tomorrow."





"The pig you caught for us has really grown
up since the last time you saw him, hasn't
he? You'd better believe it!"





"He's really put on the pounds, too. In fact,
I've had such a hard time getting him over
the fence lately that I didn't think I'd be
able to do it anymore without an assistant.
But look at you! You picked him up as if he
were light as a feather! That's unbelievable!
You know, [player]...

It doesn't seem like it's been all that long
since you first left here, but you're MUCH
stronger than I remember you being."





"Say, [player], do you remember the
day you first caught this oinker and
brought him over here?

Just look at that thing! Isn't he a lot bigger
now than the last time you saw him? And
not just bigger... He's a lot heavier, too!"





"Say, [player], is there any way you
could pick him up and take him for a walk
for me? I'd really appreciate it! My
back is just killing me..."





"Isn't our pig just mind-bogglingly huge?
We caught him after you left the island,
but who knew he'd get so big?

Even if I wanted to take him out for a
walk, he's so heavy now that it's all I can
do just to heave him over the fence."





"Say, [player], you look pretty
strapping... I bet you could lift him!
Could you do me a favor and take this guy
for a walk?"





"Isn't our pig just monstrously huge?
We caught him after you left, but I had no
idea he'd get so big!

Even if I wanted to take him for a walk,
it's all I can do to just get him outside
the fence, nowadays."





"But...you just picked him up as if he were
light as a feather! That's mind-blowing!


Wow, [player]! I didn't think it had
been that long since you first left, but
you must have been working out every day
since then! You're a powerhouse!"





"It's too dangerous to walk around outside
at night. I'm being serious, here.


If you want to play with the boys, come
back after the sun has come up. The boys
will be here waiting."





"Hey, if you've got free time, why don't you
come back when it's light out and take our
pig for a walk?"





"You know our pet pig? Well, to be honest...
We named him after you! Lucky you!


He's very smart, just like you. And just like
you, when you feed him some [red]bait[white], he starts
digging with all his might until he digs up
treasure. ...Wait, you don't do that!"





"I'm still having trouble believing that you
were able to lift our pig up over your head
like that... You're so burly!"





"I wouldn't mind you testing your might by
picking up that pig, [player], as long
as you take him for a walk afterward.
What do you say?"





"Our pig is really smart, just like you.
But unlike you, when you feed him some
[red]bait[white], he starts digging with all his might
until he digs up treasure."





"You really should try it yourself...
But I don't know, [player]...
Do you even think you can lift him?"





"You're obviously strong enough to lift the
pig over the fence... Do you think you could
take him for a walk for me?"





"[player]..."





"If you have time, could you maybe take our
little [player] for a walk?"





"I suppose I should congratulate you on
your birthday, shouldn't I?


Well, to tell the truth, I could congratulate
myself, too. We just finished building our
little hutch and paddock today! Isn't it a
delightful addition to the place?
I was actually thinking of getting a pet and
keeping it here. The boys would really like
that, I'm sure. Boys love pets!"





"I wonder what kind of animal we should
get... What do kids like these days?
Listen, dearie, if you see any good pets
around, be a lamb and just bring one [red]here[white].
[wait=30]If you do, I'll give you a little reward.
Oh! But we won't tell your grandma about
it, will we?"





"If you find an animal that would make a
good pet, just bring it here and put it
[red]inside the fence[white], all right?[red]

[white]I'll give you a little spending money
if you do! And won't that be nice?"





"Why, did you bring that little [red]piglet [white]all the
way here just for me?"





"Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!
[wait=60]I've been thinking of getting a pet
pig for a while now. The boys will be SO
happy when they get home. You sweetie!
OK, [player]... Hold out your hand.
[wait=30]This is your reward! [wait=30]Don't spend
it all in one place!"





"Why, this little darling is cute as a button!
You know, it's so cute that I wouldn't mind
having [red]even more of them[white]!"





"Why, did you find [red]these pigs[white] and bring
them here just for little old me?"





"Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!
[wait=60]I've been thinking of getting a
pet pig for a while now. Oh, and the boys
will be SO happy when they get home.
OK, [player], hold out your hand...
[wait=30]This is your reward...
[wait=30]Don't spend it all in one place!"





"And this is our gratitude for [wait=60]bringing us
new family members!"





"Why, these little darlings are so adorable
that I wouldn't mind having [red]even more of
them[white]! No, I wouldn't mind a bit!"





"Why, did you find [red]these pigs[white] and bring
them here just for little old me?"





"Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!
[wait=60]I've been thinking of getting a
pet pig for a while now. Oh, and the boys
will be SO happy when they get home.
OK, [player], hold out your hand...
[wait=30]This is your reward...
[wait=30]Don't spend it all in one place!"





"And here's our gratitude for [wait=60]bringing us new
family members!"





"And finally, this is to congratulate you for
working so hard on your birthday!
[wait=15]Happy birthday to YOOOOOUUUU!!"





"I suppose now I'll have to name these
little oinking cutie-kins..."





"Why, did you bring me another [red]piglet[white]?



Oh, were you all worried that this little guy
would get lonely hanging out inside the
fence all by himself? That is the sweetest
thing I've ever heard!
Thank you SO much for bringing us yet
another family member.


[wait=15]Here's a little something for you!"





"If you find any other [red]little piggies[white],
you know where to bring them!"





"Did you bring me another [red]piglet[white]? What?
You brought me a pair?!


Oh, you thought this little guy would get
all lonely behind the fence by himself?
That is SO sweet! Now they can have a
little pig party in there! Sooo-eee!
Thank you so much for bringing us a new
family member!

[wait=15]Thank you, thank you, thank you!"





"And this is for working so hard on
your birthday!"





"I suppose now I'll have to think up names
for these little cutie-poos..."





"Ooh! Ooh! Look at this one! You sure do
know where to find the cutest pigs on the
whole Great Sea! Hey, oinker! Oink! Oink!

Oh, now things will be ever so much more
lively in the pen. It'll be like a big pig
jamboree in there!
[wait=15]Thank you so much!
[draw_instant]Oh! That's right...[draw_char]
[wait=15]I can't let you leave without
giving you a present...
Happy birthday, [player]!"





"I guess I'd better think up some names
for these little oinky-woinkies, huh?"





"[player]! Don't you worry about
giving them exercise. I'll take the pigs out
for a walk whenever they need it. Be a
lamb and leave them behind the fence, OK?"





"Any pig as cute as this one is welcome in
my pen! You just go ahead and bring me
[red]however many[white] you like!"





"Look at how much space there is in that
pen! I'll tell you what... If you find any
other lost little [red]piggies[white], you just go right
ahead and bring them [red]here[white]! OK?"





"What should I name these little oinkers...?"





"Say, [player]...did something
happen to you?


You don't look well..."





"I'm so glad you're safe, [player]!



We've all been so worried..."





"And the boys have been longing to see
you again!"





"The boys will be so surprised to hear
you've returned! ...Just as soon as they
wake up, that is."





"Oh, did you notice how large the pig you
gave us has grown? It's a king among pigs!"





"Things got so quiet and lonely after you
left the island...

So we decided to get a pet pig!"





"'Hoy, [player]!



Hey, is it true that if you just have a
little courage and [red]run as fast as you can[white],
then you can jump to that rock out there?
Huh, is it? Is it? Tell me!"





"Hey! Aren't you listening to me?
I've been trying to ask you...


Is it true that you can jump to that rock
out there just by [red]running as fast as you
can[white]? I've gotta know, or I'll burst!"





"Wow... I hope I'll be able to jump like
you some day, [player]..."





"[player], are you going somewhere?"





"Hey! Aren't you listening to me?



Don't go, [player]!"





"[camera=12][player]!"





"[camera=12]Lots and lots of things have happened here
since you left, [player]!"





"[camera=21]First of all, my little brother doesn't wet
the bed anymore, so that's good, I guess.


And Mom got kind of chubby again."





"[camera=29][size=150]Hey! You shush!"





"[camera=21]And, umm... Umm..."





"[camera=21]Oh, yeah! And now, when you feed old
[player] [red]bait[white], he gets real excited
and digs holes in the hard patches of
[red]black dirt [white]you see around the village.
He always finds treasure in them! Yeah!"





"[camera=29]Yes, we named the pig you caught for us
after you... I hope you don't mind!"





"[camera=29]Yup, that's our pet pig's name..."





"[camera=21]I can't believe all it takes to get
[player] all excited is a little bait.
Talk about a dummy!"





"[camera=29]The pig! He's talking about our pig, not you!"





"[camera=21]We don't have any other pigs anymore.



We used to, but then we had to..."





"[camera=29][size=150]Hey! You shush!"





"[camera=31]They just... They just ran away somewhere.



Yup! That's all! They just up and ran away
one day...
Yup..."





"[camera=23][animation=10]It was delicious!"





"[camera=29][size=150]Shush!"





"[camera=31]Th-[wait=10]The milk you just drank was delicious,
[wait=10]ri-[wait=10]right? That's what you meant, wasn't it,
my darling son?

What am I to do with these boys...?"





"[camera=31]Oh,[wait=10] ho ho ho ho ho ho!"





"[camera=21]But about those other pigs you caught
for us, [player]..."





"[camera=21]Umm... See, [player]..."





"[camera=31][player]... Shouldn't you go back to
your house? I mean, isn't your grandma
waiting for you?"





"[camera=23][animation=10]It was delicious!"





"[camera=29][size=150]Shush!"





"[camera=31]What am I to do about these boys..."

[animation=10]So...aren't those clothes hot?"

"[camera=21]So? So? So?"





"[camera=23][animation=10]So...did you save Aryll?"





"[camera=29][size=150]Hey! Shush!"

"[camera=23][animation=10]So...haven't you saved Aryll yet?"

hot[animation=13] in those clothes..."





"[wait=8]I guess they're pretty neat, though!"





"So, anyway, [player]...



Can you [wait=30]close your eyes and hold out
your hand? Just for a second!"

I'm letting you borrow this [red]special[white] gift

Aren't you lucky?! Hee hee hee! "





"Ooh, why don't you try it out! Right now!
Try looking over at our house from here!"





"Don't you know how to use my [red]Telescope[white]?
It's really easy to use, Big Brother...


Press START/PAUSE, then [red]set[white] the [red]Telescope
[white]to [y], [z], or [x] on the Items screen.
Then you can use it just by pressing the
button you set it to! It's simple!"





"Hey, what's that? [player]! Are you
looking at the [red]red postbox[white]?[wait_dismiss=120]"





"The postman looks kinda weird, doesn't he?[wait_dismiss=120]"

fell into the [red]forest[white]! She needs help!"

there without something you can use to
defend yourself with!"





"[sound=7]Wh-What are you going to do if you go into
the forest and that big bird attacks you?!


You need something to [red]fight it off[white] with!!!"





"Oh, I hope whoever fell into the forest is
all right! This is so terrible..."





"That giant bird has just been flying around
searching for whoever it dropped. It'll find
her soon, I just know it!

Oh, what do we do? What do we do? You
have to find her and save her, quickly!"





"Big Brother! Are you using [c_stick][up_arrow] to [red]zoom in[white]?[wait_dismiss=120]
'Cause you should be!"

you to come back to the [red]house[white]! She's been
waiting for a while now..."

"You should probably go home and see what
Grandma wants, don't you think?"





"Hurry up, Big Brother! Grandma is waiting
for you back at the [red]house[white]! And I'm sure
everyone else on the island wants to say
hello to you, too!"

"[wait=60]...Take it with you."

kidnapped... Hasn't she?"

sweet, young child?"





"Oh, Aryll..."





"Oh, my! [player]! Congratulations!
[wait=20]That outfit looks cute on you!


[wait=10]Hey, your little sister, Aryll, was looking for
you not too long ago.


[wait=30]Oh, did I tell you?[wait=6] She was watching me
not too long ago, and she said she wanted
to learn to carry jars on her head, too,
so she could help your grandma do chores.
Hey! If you see Aryll, tell her that all she
needs to do to lift a jar is stand [red]in front of
it[white] and press [a]. And to set it down, she
just needs to press [r]! Tell her, OK?"





"'Hoy, [player]!



What's that? Today is your birthday? Well,
congrats, buddy! Are you that old already?
Wow! Time just flies right by,[wait=30] doesn't it?
You blink and POOF! There goes a year!
Why, I swear I just cut the grass in this
field the other day,[wait=30] but look at how tall
it's gotten already..."





"Say, do you want to try cutting it,
[player]? You'd be surprised at
[red]the things people drop [white]in the grass.
It's fun! It's like a treasure hunt.
Except...you're gonna need some kind of
grass-cutting tool if you want to cut the
grass. That's just common sense, buddy."





"What say you, [player]?"





"Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? What do you want?"





"OOOWWWWCH!!![wait_dismiss=45]"





"Wow. What's with that get-up?
[wait=30]Well, whatever. So, where am I...?"





"Oh, that's right![wait=10] That giant bird came and..."





"Huh? What're you showing me this for?
This is just a regular old letter."





"Miss!
[wait=10][size=150]Miss Tetra!"





"Oh! Oh, thank... Thank goodness!
You're safe!


When I saw you get dropped on this summit,
I thought for sure you'd..."





"Summit?



So that bird dropped me on the top of
a mountain?"





"Well, wasn't that nice of it!"





"Well, don't just stand there!
[wait=10][draw_instant][size=150]Let's go![draw_char]
[size=100]Time to repay our debt to that bird in full!"





"But, Miss...[wait=10] What about this boy?"





"Don't worry about him. Come on!"

[wait=20]Get ahold of yourself! She's gone.
There's nothing you can do."





"[draw_instant]What?!?[draw_char]
[wait=20]You want to come with us on our ship?"





"Do you understand what you're asking?
We're pirates! You know... PIRATES!
The terror of the seas!

What do we get out of bringing some
helpless little kid along with us?
I'll tell you what we get...a headache.

I know how you must feel, with your
sister having been kidnapped and all...


But that doesn't really have anything to
do with us, now does it?"





"And how do you figure that...?"





"Whoa, whoa, whoa there! Just who are
you?! Where do you get off butting in on
someone else's conversation?!"





"Please! All I mean to say is that if you
big, bad pirates hadn't come to this quiet
little island...

That poor girl wouldn't have been snatched
away by that bird."





"And just what do you mean by that?"





"Just be quiet for a moment, and I'll tell you!



Now, as my work entails delivering letters,
I spend much of my time traveling amongst
the many different islands. As a result,
I hear many things...
Haven't any of you heard word that young
girls have been getting kidnapped lately
from all regions of the Great Sea?

No matter. Whether you've heard it or not,
that seems to be the case. Young girls with
[red]long ears[white] like yours have been getting
kidnapped, never to be seen again.
And unless my eyes fail me, the young girl
who was just kidnapped from this island
also has [red]long ears[white], does she not? Much
like YOU do, Miss Fearsome Pirate.
My point is that the bird mistook that poor
girl for you, and that's why it grabbed her!"





"......"





"And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it
was young [player] here who saved
you from the monsters in the forest,
wasn't it?"





"...Is this true?"





"Oh![wait=20] And while I'm at it...



I may as well tell you that the bird that
kidnapped both you and [player]'s
sister has made its foul nest to the north,
on the heights of the [red]Forsaken Fortress[white]."





"The Forsaken Fortress?!



Isn't that the place where..."





"So, what are you going to do?



Under the circumstances, I don't think it
would be unreasonable for you to give
[player] a little help, now, would it?"





"Hmph... I don't need you to tell me that!"





"Even if I were to consider it...
Lately, I've heard nothing but evil rumors
about this [red]Forsaken Fortress[white]...

You can't possibly mean to go there with
nothing but that cheap little sword!
That's not brave! It's stupid!

I mean, come on! Even a simple little island
like this has to have something you could
use as a [red]shield[white]. You know, something to
protect yourself with? Anything?
Tell you what. If you come back with
something like that, we'll let you stow
away on our ship.

Oh, and one more thing: once we leave,
you won't be coming back here for a while,
so you'd better go say good-bye to your
family while you have the chance.
I don't want you getting all weepy-eyed
and homesick on me!"





"Are you ready?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"Well, hurry up, already! If you take much
longer, we're going to leave without you!
Don't think we won't!"





"This is a terrible situation, [player]...
I'm truly sorry.


Unfortunately, I can't go in your stead...
but if anything happens, please come to my
island. I will do what I can to aid you."





"Don't worry about your home while you're
gone. If anything bad happens, I promise to
bring word of it to you. I swear it!"





"She can't be serious! What is she thinking,
bringing a shrimp like you on board?!
Talk about a joke...

Boy, Miss Tetra's impulsive nature sure has
a way of landing us in hot water..."





"Listen, shrimp, whatever young Miss says
goes, so do what you have to do and be
quick about it, yeah?"





"Heya, shrimplet! Are you gonna be our new
pirate swabbie?


...'Cause any new swabbie reports to me!"





"Helloooooooo, new pirate swabbie!
Goooooood-bye, dirty pirate underwear!"





"Yes! This means I don't have to wash the
other pirates' dirty underpants anymore!"





"Shrimp! If you're going to go sailing on a
pirate ship, you better be prepared to
become a pirate, yeah?

'Cause if you get scared and start begging
and crying at us to let you off the ship
somewheres, then you're guaranteed to end
up as shark bait!"





"Good luck, [player]![wait_dismiss=60]"





"Good luck finding Aryll![wait_dismiss=60]"





"Take care of yourself![wait_dismiss=60]"





"Ugh... How much longer is this going to go
on, do you think? Do you have an estimate?"





"Are you sure you shouldn't just quit right
now? Seriously, think about it."





"I can tell you're just going to get more
sentimental from here on out."





"There's still time, you know...
[wait=20]Are you sure we shouldn't just turn around
and take you back to your island?"





"Gooood moooorrrning!"





"Gooood eeeevening!"

"Well met indeed, Jabun. I am pleased to see
that you are safe..."





"The events which we have long feared seem
to have been set into motion."





"Yes. It seems Ganon has returned. There can
be no other explanation."





"If you have sought me out...it must mean
you have found the Hero of Time,
does it not?"





"Unfortunately, that is not so."





"Then for what purpose have you come to
see me?"





"The one I have brought with me has no
connection to the legendary one.


And yet I sense great promise in the
[red]courage[white] that this one possesses."





"Promise?



You suggest that I leave the fate of Hyrule
up to mere chance?"





"I do. It is the only way."





"I see. Then I suppose it is up to the gods
to deem whether his courage is true."





"I give to you the guidepost to the gods."





"This jewel should dispel the curse that
Ganon has cast upon this land."





"So...that foul rain and endless night were
indeed elements of a curse brought on us
by Ganon! He must intend to cast this land
into pure darkness for all time..."





"Tell me, Hyrule King...
Have you learned the whereabouts of the
one who carries on the bloodline of the
princess, Zelda?"





"...I believe I have."





"That is well. You must protect Zelda.
She cannot be permitted to fall into the
hands of Ganon.

I am counting on you!"





"[red]Ganon's curse[white] has been broken by the
power of the pearl that Jabun gave us,
so morning should come soon. It is well
that we have gathered [red]all of the pearls[white].

Are you ready, [player]?


I have [red]marked [white]the places where you must[red]
[white]set the [red]pearls[white] on your [red]Sea Chart[white].[red]


[white]Once you have placed each of the pearls in
its proper location, the proving grounds for
your courage will become apparent."





"Clearly, the search for Jabun has shown
that Ganon has begun to make efforts to
block our path forward.

It is certain that the perils ahead will be
greater than any you have faced thus far.


You should finish any business you have
here on Outset right now, so that you shall
not have any regrets later."

"Hey! That's a pretty slick boat you got
there, kiddo!"





"So what do you say, kiddo? You wanna
play a boat game for [red]30 Rupees[white]?"





"What do you say?
[three_choices]Tell me the rules
I'll play now
No thanks"





"Well, I ain't that good a talker...



But here goes... Now listen up!



The deal is, you take your boat and sail
over the [red]barrels[white] floatin' in the water and
see how many [red]Rupees[white] you can bring to the
finish line [red]within the time limit[white]."





"There's two kinds of floatin' barrels you
gotta watch out for: the ones that float on
their [red]sides[white] and the ones that float [red]upright[white].

You can get the Rupees above the [red]barrels
[white]floatin' on their [red]sides[white] by just sailin'
[red]right over[white] the barrels...

But if you run into the barrels floatin'
[red]upright[white] in the water, they'll rough you up."





"You know you can press [r] to [red]jump[white] your
boat, right?


Yeah, well, to get the Rupees over the
[red]upright[white] barrels, you gotta [red]jump[white] with [r]!
It's the only way!"





"The barrels get placed out there based on
which way the wind's blowin'...


So watch that [red]wind gauge[white] behind your boat
real careful-like!"





"Oh, and one more thing: if [red]time runs out[white]
before you finish, you [red]lose[white]! So watch the
timer, too, will ya?"





"Them's the rules!



What do you say? Wanna give it a shot?"





"Oh, yeah! This time I've taken [red]10 seconds
off the timer[white], so you gotta be a little
faster than before."





"What's the matter, kiddo? You want to play
after all? Heh.


I can tell by that look in your eye!"





"Whoa! You wanna play again?"





"What's the deal? You got yourself a boat
because you're hopin' to make it in the
world, right? You wanna get rich, right?

Well, playin' my game'll make you money
faster than sailin' around lookin' for
treasure! Oh, well! Your loss, kiddo!"





"Really? Ah, well. That's how it goes.



But hey! If you change your mind, come
back and see me, OK, kiddo?"





"...[player]!? Listen, kid, you can't
just stand around on deck! You'll get in
everyone's way!

I've told [red]Niko[white] to look after you, so you'd
better report below decks and ask him what
you should be doing."





"I'll call you when we reach the Forsaken
Fortress, so until then, just go talk to
[red]Niko[white] and do whatever he tells you."





"Into the big blue, boys!!
Turn the ship full to starboard!
We head for the northern seas!"





"Listen, shrimp, you're really creeping me out
standing there like that! So quit it, yeah? 
Stay outta my way! WAY outta my way!
Go down below and find [red]Niko[white]!!"





"Hey! Zuko! You keep a strict watch up
there, yeah?! If you spot anything, give us
a shout! A LOUD shout!"





"What are you doing, shrimp!? Miss Tetra is
waiting for you up in the crow's nest!

Shake a leg, yeah? Go! Hoof it!"





"So, your name's [player], right?[sound=65]
Heh heh heh!


That's one weird get-up you got on, there.
So what's the deal? Is that popular back
on your island, or what?

Now that I think about it, though...
I think I've seen an outfit like
that before somewhere..."





"You know, come to think of it, I think
there's a picture of someone in an outfit
like yours hanging on the wall down in
Miss Tetra's cabin..."





"So that's the Forsaken Fortress...
What an evil-looking place..."





"[wait=10]You![wait=20] Get outta the way, will ya?!



......
[wait=20]Turn around right now! Climb down!"





"So... You really plan on going...
[wait=20]into the Forsaken Fortress?
...[wait=20]Listen, I'll tell you once I see it.
So[wait=20] climb down, will ya?"





"The young Miss...
[wait=20]is waiting for you up above.


We've reached[wait=20] the Forsaken Fortress."





"Hmmm! That Niko didn't make out half-bad.
...With you being the new swabbie and all."





"You should know... There's always a test
when a new pirate swabbie joins up."





"Was Niko's test...easy?
[wait=20]...Really?"





"Stop right there! This is Miss Tetra's cabin!



Most of us REAL pirates aren't even allowed
in here! There's no way we're letting an
outsider in! Don't you even THINK it!"





"You're probably wondering why we treat
young Miss Tetra with so much respect
when she's clearly so much younger than
us, aren't you, now?
Now, I won't go saying this in a very loud
voice, but while she may look young...
[wait=10]Miss Tetra's actually 35!"





"HAR! That's a joke, shrimpy!"





"Ahoy there, young shrimpy! It sounds like
we've actually arrived! Head on up to the
deck and have a look-see, why don't you?"





"Oh! Well now! Ahoy there, swabbie!
As of today...[sound=59][wait=10][draw_instant] EH-HEH-AHEM![draw_char]
[wait=10]I am your superior... Niko! Now, I promise I'll
go easy on you, so you do as I say, OK?"





"Right! Now, first off you have to take the
test all new pirates have to take. It's a bit
of a doozy, so get ready!

You watch everything I'm about to show you
real careful-like so you can cram it into
your no-doubt mushy swabbie brain!"





"First off, you gotta press this [red]switch[white].
This is the only easy part.


Just walk up to it and tilt [control_stick_up] [up_arrow] to step
on it. Presto! Switch pressed!

"





"Now, check it out! After the platforms rise
up from the floor, you gotta jump on them!"





"OK, so I was able to jump to this first one
myself...but that next one is too far, right?


That's when you gotta do THIS!"





"If you jump right at the rope, you can grab
onto it and use [control_stick_up_down][up_arrow][down_arrow] to [red]swing[white]. Swing until
you get close enough to the next platform
then press [a] to [red]let go [white]and jump to it!"





"So, do you think you get how to do it?
You have to swing from platform to
platform and try to get to the entrance
of that room over there!"





"Here's the problem, though, swabbie!
The platforms only stay raised for a little
while, so if you don't get there by the time
they drop, you have to start over!"





"It will probably take you at least [red]one year
[white]before you're good enough to make it all
the way here. One rough year. One tough
year, full of bumps and bruises.
[wait=20]Of course, if you manage to do it faster,
I'll reward you!"





"Now, give it a try! This ought to be good
for a chuckle or two!"





"Hey! What are you doing? You have to jump
and make it over here! Falling isn't part
of the program, swabbie!"





"Whaaaaat!? You did it already???



........."





"I...[wait=10] I...[wait=10] I'm proud to have you as...
[wait=10]As my...[wait=10] As my underling!"





"[wait=10][size=75]I...[wait=10] I wonder if it's OK to just give that to him..."





"[wait=10][size=75]...I don't see why not... I doubt I'll get busted..."





"All right, swabbie! I'll tell you what!
[wait=10]You can have the [red]treasure[white] in that chest
over there! It's your reward from the great
and generous Niko!"





"Hu-[wait=10]Hurry up and take it! I'm serious!
Grab it and get outta here!


Someone might come! Hurry up, swabbie!"





"Gah! But there's still so much stuff I have
to teach you... This is so lame!


Ahh, well... I guess it can wait until you
finish whatever it is you have to do."





"Come back and see me again after you
finish your errand, OK, swabbie?"





"Hey! [player]! We've reached the
Forsaken Fortress! Hurry and get up here!"





"Oh, there's one thing I forgot to tell you.



When you're hanging on to a rope, you can
[red]hold [white][r] then tilt [left_arrow][control_stick_left_right][right_arrow] to [red]change direction
[white]and tilt [control_stick_up_down][up_arrow][down_arrow] to [red]climb up and down[white]. Try it
if you don't like the angle of the next jump."





"Hurry and take it before someone comes!"





"'Cause I can never figure out what you're
trying to say! THAT'S why you've gotta be
sure to shout, Zuko!"





"New swabbies always get stuck doing the
hardest work. It's a real raw deal, but hey.


I'll tell you... It sure sounds like Niko is
happy to finally not be the bottom rung on
the pirate ladder![wait=10][draw_instant] You bet he is![draw_char]"





"...Hey, but don't sweat it. I'm sure you'll do
just fine, so long as you don't [wait=10]disobey him."





"I guess you could say it's our way of
welcoming new swabbies.[wait=10][draw_instant] Yup. That it is.[draw_char]"





"One way or the other, you'll figure out what
it is you gotta do once you get below
decks. [wait=10]Then be sure to do it.[wait=10][draw_instant] Yup. Do it.[draw_char]"





"I suppose it was just chance that we lost
our last Miss when Miss Tetra was still
young. [wait=10]Hooo... Fate is cruel, she is.

[wait=10]That's why Miss Tetra took over so young.
She owes it to her predecessor.


Everyone's come to respect her for that.
For coping with so much, at such an age.


Respect has nothing to do with how many
years you've been on the earth. But you're
probably too young to understand that."





"Hey! [wait=20][player]!
Here I am! [wait=10]Up here!"





"What were you doing with Niko?"





"Don't tell me you were playing some stupid
game[wait=30] for treasure...were you?"





"[wait=45]...Well, whatever!
[wait=30]There's something you need to see!
Have a look over there...

That's the cursed isle known as the
[red]Forsaken Fortress[white]."





"There are all sorts of strange rumors about
this place. What I do know is that long
ago, it used to be the hideout of a no-good
group of pirates we used to compete with...
But they were just small-time. Now, the
place looks like it's pretty dangerous."





"[draw_instant]Ah! I knew it! Look![draw_char]
[wait=60][draw_instant]Over there![draw_char][wait=60] By that window!"





"Have you ever seen so many seagulls flock
like that before?


...I'll bet you anything that's the place
where they've got your sister locked up!"





"...But it looks like the whole place is under
really tight guard."





"This won't work... We'd be spotted before
we got anywhere near landing there."





"[sound=8]Hmmm...[wait=60] What do we do now?"





"Look, don't struggle. If you really want to
get into a dangerous place like that, this is
the only way to do it. Trust me.

We pirates do this all the time. Don't worry
about it! It'll be a piece of cake!"





"Is everybody ready!?"





"Never you fear, kid. We're pros. We're going
to launch you good!"

this place and take him to where you and

Do you remember poor Tingle?"





"Hooooo... You're mean. You're terrible. You're
not even lifting a finger. And after poor
Tingle begged you to help him like that..."





"Sir, do you, by chance, enjoy watching me
suffer? Is this lack of assistance done
[wait=20][draw_instant]intentionally[draw_char]...?

For now, we'll just take these girls.


I'm sure their fathers back in town will pay
a handsome reward for their return."





"I'm so sorry to interrupt such a
heartwarming reunion...
"





"But isn't there still something that you need
to take care of?"





"If you're worried about your sister...don't be.
I promise I'll deliver her safely back to your
little island.

Normally, I'd expect a huge reward for
something like this...but this time,
it's my treat!"





"Listen, Aryll, your brother still has some
things to take care of. Big, important,
grown-up things.

He'll be back soon, so you just wait nice
and quiet until he returns, OK?"





"[dummy=3][size=75]But, Big Brother..."





"Miss Tetra! We have to hurry! The bird will
be here any second!"





"Gonzo! Excellent! You're just in time!
[wait=20]Take this one for me."





"Huh?! [wait=20]But she's..."





"She's fine! Just do as you're told!"





"Big Brother![wait_dismiss=60]"





"[player]!
[wait=30]We'll be back. I swear it!"





"[wait=30][size=75]I swear it."





"It's been a while, boy."





"You have done well to sneak into my
fortress and wriggle your way all the
way up here."





"I suppose the least I can do is commend
you for your reckless courage."





"My name is [red]Ganondorf[white]...



And I am the master of Forsaken Fortress."





"By the way, boy... When you drew that
[red]sword[white] of yours out of its pedestal...


Did you by chance notice how all of the
monsters frozen in time down there
suddenly began stirring again?"





"Do you understand precisely what that
means? ...I highly doubt you do."





"Foolish child. While that sword is indeed
the [red]blade of evil's bane[white], at the same time,
it has long played another role...

You see, it is also a sort of key...
a most wretched little key that has kept
the [red]seal[white] on me and my magic intact!"





"By withdrawing the blade, you have
[red]broken[white] that [red]seal[white]..."





"Fool! 
...Why do I waste my breath on a child?
Do you still not understand?"





"You cannot defeat me with a [red]blade that
does not sparkle[white] with the [red]power to repel
evil[white]! What you hold is useless."





"Go back to the world below, and tell that
to the pathetic fools who made this blade!"





"[wait=60]Its power is gone, and its edges are dull!"





"[player]! Get up!"





"Uhh![wait=10] Stop![wait=10] Let...[wait=10] Let me go!"





"You pathetic little sea rat!"





"          [size=150]! ? ! "





"My [red]Triforce of Power[white] is resonating!



Ha! At long last, I have found you...[wait=15]
[red]Princess Zelda[white]!"





"Wh[wait=10]-What?! [wait=10]What are you talking about?
[wait=10]I don't know any[wait=30] Zelda..."





"Feigning ignorance will gain you nothing!



Tell me... If you are not Zelda, then why
do you have this fragment of the [red]Triforce[white]?"





"It's all right, [player]!
She has merely lost consciousness."





"Your sister has escaped the Forsaken
Fortress with the pirates. You can relax.
She's safe now."





"Lord Valoo! You arrived not a moment too
soon... [wait=20]We are deeply grateful."





"Still...it is too soon for us to relax.
Ganon cannot be destroyed by such simple
means as wrath and fire."





"I am aware of this.



Yet I thought our first priority should be
to separate these two from Ganon's grasp."





"I see...and I agree.
Very well, then! We are counting on you!"





"[player], I will explain things later!
Now we must return to the world beneath
the sea!"





"O great hero, chosen by the Master Sword!"





"My name is [red]Laruto[white]."





"I am a Zora [red]sage[white]. For an age, I offered
my prayers here in the [red]Earth Temple[white],
praying that the power to repel evil would
ever remain within the Master Sword."





"And yet...unfortunately, due to Ganondorf's
evil designs, the Master Sword you hold
has lost this power."





"After his defeat at the hands of the Hero of
Time, Ganondorf was sealed away...but not
for all time. He was revived, and he
returned to Hyrule in a red wrath.
He attacked this temple and stole my soul,
knowing that he had to remove the power
contained in that enchanted blade.

In order to return the power to repel evil to
your sword, you must find another to take
my stead in this temple and ask the gods
for their assistance."





"You must find the one who carries on
my bloodline... The one who holds this
sacred [red]instrument[white]..."





"Nothing can stop the flow of time or the
passing of generations...but the fate carried
within my bloodline endures the ravages of
all the years. It survives."





"The [red]song you just conducted[white] is one which
will [red]open the eyes [white]of the new [red]sage[white] and
awaken within that sage the melody that
will carry our prayers to the gods."





"The [red]door[white] that blocks your way will only
open when [red]the sage plays that song[white]."





"May the winds of fortune blow with you."





"Are you the new hero?"





"I am [red]Fado[white] of the Kokiri tribe. I know I
appear to you as a child, but the eyes can
oft deceive. I am a most esteemed sage."





"I had been praying here so that the power
to repel evil would continue to be contained
within the blade of the Master Sword..."





"But I was attacked by the evil Ganondorf...
and this is what happened to me."





"You wish to return the power to your blade,
don't you?"





"In that case, look for the [red]one[white] who has the
same [red]instrument[white] that I hold, and teach him
the [red]song[white] you just played."





"Once you do, I'm certain the holder of the
instrument will feel the blood of the sages
awaken within his veins."





"That [red]Wind Waker[white] you hold was used long
ago to conduct us sages when we played
our song to call upon the gods."





"In those days, it was always the king who
conducted for us..."





"Please... Tell the king that I will still
play...even in the next world!"





"That garb you wear...
Could you be the legendary hero?


Has the king at long last found the
Hero of Time?"





"What is the matter? Do you not understand
the ancient Hylian tongue?


So...you are not the Hero of Time."





"I must apologize. I was in error.
[wait=30]I saw your clothing, and suddenly I felt a
longing for an age gone by... That longing
caused the ancient tongue to pass my lips.
I am the guardian spirit of this Forest
Haven_the Deku Tree.


I owe you my thanks for your aid in ridding
me of those foul creatures...


Tell me... Was it not the [red]King of Red
Lions[white]_the boat who speaks_who led you
to this place?"





"So it is true...



Then you have come here because you have
need of the [red]pearl of the goddess[white]?"





"I see...
I knew there was a reason the monsters had
begun to congregate in the regions around
my wood. Now I understand it.
He has returned...
Ganon has returned...


In that case, we must make haste."





"Koroks! Little children of the woods!
This traveler is not your enemy. Let your
hearts be at ease, and show yourselves!"





"What do you call yourself?



[player]?



Well, then, [player]...
These are the Koroks_the spirits of
the forest.

Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks
took on human forms, but when they came
to live on the sea, they took these shapes.

Now they fear people...but to me, they will
ever be my cherished little children."





"As it happens, you have come just in time
for a ceremony that the Koroks hold but
once every year. It is about to begin.

I shall grant the [red]pearl[white] to you once their
ceremony is complete.


I must apologize for the brief delay, but if
the ceremony is not completed soon, an ill
fate could befall us.

So, let it begin! Are you ready, my children?"





"W-We are not, O Great Deku Tree!
Something terrible has happened!
It is Makar! Makar!"





"What is the matter, Linder?
You and Makar are always late..."





"N-No! It is not that, O Great Deku Tree!
Makar...fell into the [red]Forbidden Woods[white]!"





"[size=150]WHAT?!
The [red]Forbidden Woods[white]?"





"I told him to be careful! But still Makar
flew above the Forbidden Woods, and as he
drew close to it..."





"Foolish little Makar..."





"[player], you have heard all this?



The [red]Forbidden Woods [white]are [red]right beside [white]the
hallowed island of our Forest Haven.[wait=30]
Those woods... The whole region is a vile
place that is home to evil beasts.
And now it seems they have taken a child
of the forest named [red]Makar[white]. 

...Your presence here is no mistake, I deem.
The King of Red Lions likely expects great
deeds of you_it is why he brought you here.
I am sorry to ask this of you, but can you
go rescue young Makar for me?"





"But, Great Deku Tree! ...People cannot
fly through the air..."





"Ah, yes... Thank you, child. You are right.
It is not possible to enter those woods
from the sea, is it...

[player], I would guess from your
size that you are heavier than my Korok
children...yet I think we may still be
able to solve this dilemma.
You must use the [red]item I shall bestow
upon you[white] and fly through the sky!"





"Hmmm?



What is this?
You seem to be quite bold."





"Hmph!



Forgive me, [player], but could you
climb up to my crown and get the [red]leaf
[white]from up there?"





"Ah, yes... For one like you to reach the
heights, it will be necessary to use the
[red]Baba Buds[white] scattered around here.

Ask the little [red]Koroks[white] about how to use
them. They shall teach you all you need."





"What is the matter?"





"If you cannot even reach that leaf, there is
no way you will be able to save Makar from
the monsters in the Forbidden Woods."





"You will need [red]Magic Power[white] to use my leaf.
You can find magic jars in [red]grass clumps[white]
and [red]vases[white] and after you defeat[red] monsters[white]."





"You must build up your reserves of magic
power and use [red]that leaf[white] to fly from the
high cliffs of my Forest Haven over to
the Forbidden Woods!"





"The Koroks can teach you how to fly."





"Please take care of Makar!"





"Every year after the Koroks perform this
ceremony, they fly off to the distant
islands on the sea and plant my seeds
in the hopes that new forests will grow."





"Forests hold great power_they can change
one tiny island into a much larger land.
Soon, a day will come when all the islands
are one, connected by earth and grove.
And the people who live on that great
island will be able to join hands and,
together, create a better world.

Such is my dream."





"...But the one you are chasing is trying
to prevent that dream from ever coming
to pass."





"[player]...



Already, your fate is tied to the fate of this
world. You must proceed with great care."





"If ever you find yourself troubled or lost,
return to this haven...


I shall be waiting for you."





"How are things in the world,
[player]?"





"As you can see, I am slowly growing older
and feebler. It seems only my wisdom is
full of vigor lately. But that is just the way
of life, child, and not cause for sadness.
If there is anything you wish to know,
just ask! I will aid you as I may."





"What is it you wish to know?
[three_choices]Tell me about the Koroks
Tell me about Forest Water
Nothing"





"What do you wish to learn about?
[three_choices]The Koroks
The King of Red Lions
Nothing"





"What is the matter? Is there something else
you wish to ask me?"





"What do you wish to learn about?
[three_choices]The Island Koroks
The Forest Koroks
Nothing"





"Are you concerned about the little Koroks
who left the safety of our Forest Haven?


It is indeed true that there are many islands
on the Great Sea that have grown dark
and dangerous. Who knows what perils
might await my children?
I shall mark the places that my Korok
children have journeyed to on your
[red]Sea Chart[white], [player].

Could you be so kind as to check on them
for me as you proceed with your quest?


I entrust their care to you..."





"All you need to do is check your [red]Sea Chart
[white]to see where my children are."





"But do you not already know about the
Koroks who have left our haven?"





"You can conduct here, but it will not
do anything."





"Ahh, if only the Great Deku Tree were
here right now..."





"OHHHH! If you don't need [red]Boko Baba Seeds[white],[red]
[white]I'll buy them for [red]5 Rupees each[white]!"





"I'll buy a maximum of [red][boko_baba_seed_count][white]."





"You want to sell your [red]Boko Baba Seeds[white]?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"You wish to know about the Koroks who
remain here in the Forest Haven?


Well, you can find [red]Hollo [white]in that hole
over there, researching potions."





"How many do you want to sell?
[boko_baba_sell_selector]
Choose how many with [control_stick] and press [a]."





"For [boko_baba_seed_count], I'll pay [red][beedle_rupee_offer][white]!



You sure you want to sell?
[two_choices]Yes
Maybe not"





"'Bye! Come again!"





"But even if I buy them, you can't carry
all those [red]Rupees[white]!"





"Huh? Then don't show them to me!"





"OHHHH! If you don't need your [red]Skull
Necklaces[white], I'll buy them for [red]5 Rupees each[white]."





"I can buy up to [red][skull_necklace_count][white]."





"You want to sell your [red]Skull Necklaces[white]?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"How many do you want to sell?
[skull_necklace_sell_selector]
Choose how many with [control_stick] and press [a]."





"And as for [red]Makar[white], well...just look!
He is right there!"





"He is busy practicing a new song for next
year's ceremony.


He is already looking forward to it."





"As for [red]Makar[white], he is somewhere here in the
Forest Haven. But I do not know where.


...Outside[wait=10]...perhaps?"





"I am certain he is practicing his little
leaf cello somewhere. You should be able
to hear his music when you are near to him."





"[red]Makar[white]...?



Now that I think about it, I haven't seen
him of late. Perhaps he is hiding somewhere
preparing [red]a song for next year's ceremony[white].

At such times, he never allows himself to
be seen. It would be [red]useless to look for him[white].
But do not worry. I am certain he will return
before long."





"Is there anything else you wish to ask?"





"I see. Well, if ever you wish to ask anything
else of me, you are welcome to do so."





"The Forest Water?



So, you have learned the secret of our
Forest Haven?"





"The [red]Forest Water[white] is a mystical and
powerful draught that fills the trees
with life and vitality."





"With such water, it would even be possible
to return life to a battered, withered tree. "





"And yet, the [red]Forest Water[white] is quickly spoiled
by the air outside the Forest Haven. 


Once it leaves the borders of these woods,
it will lose its potency after just
[red]20 minutes[white] and become no different
from [red]ordinary water[white]."





"I suppose it is thanks to such water that
this gnarled, old tree has been able to
live for so many long years."





"When the worst of all possible events
comes to pass, and Ganon is revived
once again...

One shall seek the hero who is destined
to defeat the great evil..."





"That is the destiny the goddesses have
placed upon the [red]King of Red Lions[white]."





"Since that day, he has been sailing the
Great Sea in search of a young hero not
unlike yourself."





"But I cannot yet reveal to you the truth
behind who that boat really is.


Perhaps if you are able to defeat Ganon
as the hero of old once did..."





"Then, all will be revealed to you."





"Until then, you must proceed in your quest,
[player]. Do not lose your way."





"We Koroks pass most of our days far away
from our sacred Forest Haven, raising new
trees to foster healthy forests on the many
islands of the Great Sea.
Today is the day we were to return to our
home for our annual ceremony."





"But poor Makar..."





"Please, great swordsman! Please save our
brother, Makar!"





"If we are unable to hold our ceremony, we
will not be able to raise any new forests."





"If that comes to pass, then evil days will
follow. The Great Deku Tree's power will
wane, and our power will wane with it...
We might even wither altogether..."





"The Forbidden Woods were once our home.
They were peaceful back then."





"I would guess that our homes should still
exist somewhere deep within the woods.


If you have trouble anywhere in the forest,
just look for the [red]stump-shaped houses[white]."





"[red]High atop the Forest Haven[white] is a [red]branch
[white]that hangs out over the sea. If you take off
from there, you should be able to float to
and enter the [red]Forbidden Woods[white].
That is what you need the [red]Deku Leaf[white] for."





"Wow! You're quite good at that, Mr. Knight!
Just keep doing that until you get all the
way up to the top!"





"If you shoot out facing the wrong direction,
don't panic! If you don't tilt [control_stick] in
any direction, you'll land safely back in
the Baba Bud."





"You're almost to the top! But be careful!
You don't want to fall now that you're so
close. It's only a little higher."





"Do you know about [red]this flower[white]? It's called
a [red]Baba Bud[white]. You can stand in front of it
and tilt [control_stick_up][up_arrow] to jump into it."





"Baba Buds have this peculiar habit of
[red]shooting you up into the air[white] after you
jump into them. So you can use them to
[red]jump up[white] to hard-to-reach places."





"As soon as you jump into a [red]Baba Bud[white],
tilt [left_arrow][control_stick_left_right][right_arrow] to align the direction you wish
to jump in.

Once you're in the air, you can use [control_stick_up_down][up_arrow][down_arrow]
to adjust the length of your jump."





"You're very talented, Mr. Swordsman!"





"See?! If you jump from Baba Bud to Baba
Bud like that, you can gradually make
your way to higher and higher branches."





"We Koroks can fly through the sky using
our own [red]Deku Leaves[white]."





"We Koroks are very light...
You look like you weigh a lot more than
we do. Do you think you'll be all right?"





"In order to [red]fly[white] using the Great Deku Tree's
[red]Deku Leaf[white], you must have [red]magic power[white]."





"...You look a lot heavier than us Koroks,
so you probably need a lot of magic..."





"Now that I think about it, my friend [red]Hollo
[white]is researching [red]potions that replenish
magic power[white]. You should go see him before
you leave here."





"Very good, Mr. Swordsman! You've already
mastered using the [red]Deku Leaf[white]!"





"But...since you're so much heavier than
we are, you can't fly very far, can you? 
How unfortunate...

Well, anyway, this is the exit that leads
to the Forbidden Woods, where our brother,
Makar, is being held."





"Please take care of Makar!"





"You need [red]magic power [white]in order to use the
[red]Deku Leaf[white] to fly. Without magic power, it's
just a useless twig!
[red]
[white]You can find [red]Magic Jars hidden[white] in the
[red]grass[white] and [red]vases[white] around here, so be sure to
look for them when you run low."





"Congratulations, swordsman!



It appears you've finally gotten the
Deku Leaf!"





"That eerie-looking island over there is home
to the [red]Forbidden Woods[white]. Makar is trapped
somewhere within there.

You'll have to float over to the entrance
from here using your [red]Deku Leaf[white].


But...when you're flying with the [red]Deku Leaf[white],
you're at [red]the mercy of the wind[white]. If the wind
can't carry you there, you'll fall into the
sea before you land..."





"If only the [red]wind[white] were blowing in the right
direction to carry you there..."





"You need [red]lots and lots[white] of [red]magic power[white] to
float from here to the [red]Forbidden Woods[white].


My friend [red]Olivio[white] is on that tiny plateau
there to the [red]southwest[white].


You should be able to replenish your magic
power there, so you probably should fly
that way first. If only the [red]wind was blowing
in that direction[white]..."





"Too bad the wind isn't blowing to the
[red]southwest[white]..."





"Wow! The wind is blowing just right!



Please! Ride this wind to the [red]southwest[white] and
let it carry you to my friend [red]Olivio[white]."





"First, make sure your [red]Deku Leaf[white] is set to
either [y], [z], or [x]. Then just jump from
here and immediately press the button."





"Let this wind carry you to my friend
[red]Olivio[white] on the [red]plateau to the southwest[white]!


Please bring Makar back to us!"





"Nice job, swordsman! It looks like you've
already mastered using your [red]Deku Leaf[white].
You're a quick study!

The first thing you should do is cut the
grass around here to [red]replenish [white]your
[red]magic power[white]."





"The entrance to the Forbidden Woods is
on a much higher level than the entrance
to our Forest Haven.

In order to get up to such a high place,
you'll have to catch the swirling [red]updraft[white].
Can you see the updraft, swordsman?
The updrafts around here move swiftly.
You have to time your jump just right,
so that the wind will fill your Deku Leaf
and carry you into the updraft, giving you
the lift you need.
Once you're floating on high, just let the
wind take you to the entrance to the woods."





"I don't think you can make it to the
[red]Forbidden Woods [white]if the wind isn't blowing
to the [red]northwest[white]...

And that's not all. You also have to catch
the [red]updraft [white]just right..."





"It would be really helpful if the wind would
just blow to the [red]northwest[white]..."





"This is great! The wind is perfect!



I'm amazed, swordsman! You can control
the wind? That's incredible!


Well, now you just need to time your jump
[red]so the wind carries you into the updraft[white].
Fly, swordsman! To the [red]Forbidden Woods[white]!"





"But be careful! The monsters flying around
the entrance to the Forbidden Woods might
try to stop you from getting there.

If they do, you can use the [red]Deku Leaf[white] in
midair to [red]fend them off[white]."





"Just press the button you set the [red]Deku Leaf
[white]to_[y], [z], or [x]_to create a [red]gust of air
that will fend off monsters[white]. Use it to
get by the monsters near the entrance."





"Please find Makar!"





"Hello, swordsman! You seem to be in
high spirits!


As for me, I'm using the fruit of the forest
to create potions. I'm called [red]Hollo[white]."





"I wish I could create a potion that would
help you, swordsman..."





"But the ones I have here only seem to work
on my fellow Koroks..."





"I know!



If you can somehow gain magic power,
swordsman, then you will surely need a
potion that can replenish it!"





"Then_if I can get the right ingredients_
I might be able to make a potion for you."





"Oh! But I haven't seen the ingredients that
help recover magic power here in the forest."





"If I had [red]seeds from the flower monsters [white]in
the [red]Forbidden Woods[white], then maybe I could
make a potion for you..."





"Do you know about those seeds?"





"I need at least [red]four Boko Baba Seeds[white]
in order to make a potion.


Well, that, and an [red]empty bottle[white]. You
mustn't forget that."





"If only I had many of the [red]flower monster
seeds [white]from the Forbidden Woods, then I
could make a [red]potion that replenishes both
life energy and magic power[white] for you."





"Don't you know about them?"





"What is that? Did you want me to
do something with it?"





"Oh! That's... That's a [red]Boko Baba Seed[white]!"





"That's it! That's what I need to make the
kind of [red]super-replenishing potion [white]that
would help you, swordsman!"





"That's a Boko Baba Seed, isn't it? If I mix
some of these up, I can make the kind of
[red]super-replenishing potion[white] that would help
you, swordsman!"





"Oh, but I'd need at least [red]four[white] of these
[red]seeds [white]to make one helping of the potion."





"I'm sorry."





"In order to create a potion from [red]Boko Baba
Seeds[white], I'll need at least [red]four[white] of them.


Return after you collect at least [red]four [white]seeds."





"All right, I'm going to use four of your
seeds to create a super-replenishing potion."





"Please wait just a moment."





"Onjalla, manjalla, CHO-WAY![wait_dismiss=226]"





"Hah hah! It's ready. Here you go."





"Come see me again after you gather
more seeds."





"I'll be waiting."





"Oh, but I can't give you any potion if you
don't have an [red]empty bottle[white] to carry it in."





"I'm sorry."





"Please come back after you get an
[red]empty bottle[white] to carry the potion in."





"Swordsman! Thank you so much for bringing
Makar back to us!


And now that we have completed our
ceremony, I can go back to researching
my potions!"





"By the way, did you find any
[red]Boko Baba Seeds[white]?


If you have any, set them to [y], [z], or [x]
and show them to me."





"Swordsman! Thank you so much for bringing
Makar back to us!


I am [red]Hollo[white]. I make potions from the fruits
of the forest."





"Swordsman... Are you the one who
rescued me?"





"You have my thanks!"





"When all went dark around me, I thought
my time on the earth was over."





"But...why are you here, swordsman?"





"What? The Great Deku Tree sent you?!



Oh! Th-That's right! Today's the day of our
annual ceremony!


Oh, I'm in trouble! I shouldn't be here!
I must get out of here immediately!"





"Let's go! Quickly!"





"Thank you very much, swordsman. You must
find [red][remaining_korok_count] more [white]of my fellow Koroks.


If you pour that [red]Forest Water[white] on all of our
trees, then the trees will surely grow
strong again."





"But remember: in just [remaining_forest_water_time],
the [red]Forest Water [white]you have will turn into
[red]plain water[white]. So hurry up and look for my
fellow Koroks!"





"The [red]Forest Water[white] you have will turn into
[red]plain water [white]in just [remaining_forest_water_time]. Hurry! Please!
You must find my fellow Koroks!"





"Swordsman! Come see how healthy my
forest tree has become! Wow! I'm so happy!
Thank you so much!"





"You should return once this tree has spread
its roots to create a large forest.


I'm certain it will be quite beautiful."





"That's too bad...
Your [red]Forest Water[white] turned into [red]plain water
[white]before you were able to pour it on all of
the wilting trees."





"You have to water all the trees before the
[red]Forest Water[white] loses its life-giving power."





"The [red]Great Deku Tree[white] probably knows where
the rest of my [red]fellow Koroks[white] are.


Please bring [red]Forest Water[white] for my tree
once again."





"Hello, swordsman. I haven't seen you in
a while. How have you been?"





"I've come here to plant the Great Deku
Tree's seed..."





"But look!"





"Usually, the forest trees sprout quite
vigorously wherever you plant them, but
for some reason, this one has withered..."





"...I'd be willing to bet that the trees
my fellow Koroks have planted are
withering, as well."





"It seems that when one tree fails to grow
from its seed, [red]all [white]the [red]forest trees [white]from
that year's seeds [red]wither[white] and [red]fail [white]to grow
tall and mighty."





"What are we to do? If we are not able to
nurse these trees to health, the forest will
never spread, and the Great Deku Tree will
slowly wither and die..."





"...



Maybe if we could sprinkle the [red]water [white]from
the [red]Forest Haven[white] on the tree... Maybe then
this sapling would be saved.

That water is the wellspring of the Great
Deku Tree's life force."





"Swordsman! Could you go to the [red]Forest
Haven[white] and get some of the [red]water [white]that flows
around the Great Deku Tree?

Could you get some and sprinkle it on this
poor [red]forest tree[white]?"





"Please? Please help me!"





"I will do what I can here to make sure this
forest tree does not wither any further."





"Please, swordsman, go to the [red]Forest Haven[white]
and bring back some of the [red]Forest Water[white]."





"Can you please help me?"





"Hello, swordsman! I haven't seen you in a
while. How have you been?"





"Huh?



You say the [red]forest trees[white] my fellow Koroks
have planted are [red]withering[white]?"





"So, it's true! As you can see, the forest
tree I have planted is doing the same."





"I can't help but think that this, too, is the
result of Ganondorf's evil plot. Could it be?"





"...Regardless, in order to bring the life
back into this poor withered sapling,
I will certainly need [red]Forest Water[white]."





"Swordsman! Could you please go to the
[red]Forest Haven[white] and bring back some of the
[red]water[white] that flows around the Great Deku
Tree? Could you sprinkle it on this tree?"





"Please? I beg of you!"





"Please, Mr. Swordsman. Could you please
go get [red]Forest Water[white] once more and [red]take it[white]
to all [red]eight[white] of the Koroks who guard the
withered forest trees?"





"The tree is withering..."





"You poured Forest Water on it, but it still
has not recovered all of its vigor."





"The tree has recovered all of its vigor!"





"You already have Forest Water in
your [red]bottle[white]."





"Your [red]Forest Water[white] has become [red]plain water[white]."





"Oh, Makar! You have returned safely!"





"I'm sorry, Great Deku Tree...



I know you warned us many times, but
still I did not listen..."





"Do not worry, Makar. You are safe now.
Just be more careful from now on.
You have done well, [player]. I must
thank you for your brave deeds.
Here is that which I have promised you.
Please accept it."





"It is my hope that this [red]pearl[white] shall lead you
to a fair destiny!"





"All is well, Makar. Do not cry.



Please... Play your songs for me as you
always do."





"Oh, that's right! We must begin our
ceremony soon, before the day ends!


I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.
Let the ceremony begin!"





"Oh, Great [player]...



As my thanks to you, I shall play even
harder than I normally do.


I hope you enjoy it!"





"Great Deku Tree! This year you have once
again produced some splendid seeds!"





"With these seeds, we will continue to
spread new forests across the Great Sea."





"Let us go, Koroks! To the sea!"





"See you all next year!"





"Take care!"





"Farewell, great swordsman!
May the winds of chance bring us together
again someday!"





"Thank you, [player], for all that
you've done for me.


How was my performance? Did it suit your
tastes or no?"





"This instrument is the one the Great Deku
Tree gave to me on the day of my birth.


He said it is an instrument that [red]people
[white]played long, long ago. It has taken many
long hours of practice for me to be able
to perform at the level I do now."





"[red]Eight[white] of my fellow Koroks have set out on
journeys to create new forests in the world.


But both Hollo, who studies the making of
potions, and I are always on this island.
Please come to see us here again. We'll be
waiting for you."





"I'm going to practice much more so that
next year's performance will be spectacular.


I hope you'll come back to see us again
then. You will, won't you?"





"Oh! [player]! I haven't seen you in
quite some time, have I?


I'm surprised you were able to find me here."





"Hmm? You're wondering why I'm all the
way down here?"





"I'm practicing a new song for next year's
ceremony. And I need privacy!


It isn't any fun if everyone knows in
advance what song I'll play."





"What? You can hear my song outside?"





"Ruh[wait=20]-really...?
[wait=10]I thought the sound of the waves would
drown it out..."





"Perhaps I should play a little more softly
when I practice from now on."





"Please, if you don't mind, keep the fact
that I'm practicing here a secret. I don't
want everyone to know about it."





"Why, is that a conductor's baton?



[player]! Are you a maestro?!



That's incredible!"





"Are you going to conduct for me,
[player]?


What kind of song is it? I can't wait to
hear it! Please, conduct!"





"Oh! Are you going to conduct for me again?



Ooh, I can't wait! This will be so much fun!"





"Hmmm... That's a nice song.



[size=75]Is that it? My songs are better than that..."





"Oh! I'm sorry! Did you hear that? I guess
that was kind of rude!"





"Huh? Are you done? Oh, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to your song."





"Hmmm... Does it go something like...this?



Strange... Why does it feel like I already
know this song..?"





"[player]..."





"This sacred song that you've conducted has
awakened me... I know myself now!
I am the [red]sage of the Wind Temple[white]..."





"It is my fate to return the [red]power to repel
evil[white] to your [red]Master Sword[white]."





"...And to ease the regrets of my ancestors.
Oh, [player], please! You must take
me with you to the [red]Wind Temple[white]."





"[player], I have fully [red]restored[white] the
[red]power to repel evil [white]to your Master Sword."





"...And my ancestors are most satisfied."





"I shall continue praying to the gods here.



[player], please step into the [red]light
[white]and return above ground."





"May the winds of fortune be at your back."





"Ohhh... Owwww..."





"[player]! You're all right?"





"What is this place...?"





"Hey! And [red]Ganondorf[white]!
What happened to him?"





"[player]! What are you doing?"





"You must come now to the [red]room[white] where you
got the [red]Master Sword[white]!"





"[size=75]Who is using that [red]stone[white]...?"





"Just who are you?"





"[player] and I are the only ones who
can speak through this stone!


How dare you use what's not yours?!"





"...Your name is Tetra, correct?"





"You must come with [player] to see
me at once!"





"Hmph! Well, don't you sound important!
...Fine. We're on our way. Just hold
your horses, whoever you are."





"[player], what are you waiting for?
You heard the stone. You're supposed to
[red]show me[white] how to get to where [red]that voice[white] is!"





"Are you him? Are you the one who was
speaking through my stone without my
permission? Answer me!"





"That stone is an enhanced version of the
Gossip Stones long spoken of in the legends
of the [red]Hyrulian Royal Family[white]. I am the one
[red]who made it[white]."





"You made it?
[wait=10]The royal family's Gossip Stone?


I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you're
talking about."





"Have neither of you heard the tales?



Tales of the [red]kingdom[white] spoken of in the
legend of the great hero... The place where
the [red]power of the gods lies hidden[white]..."





"[red]This place[white], where the two of you now
stand, is that kingdom."





"And I am its [red]king[white]:
Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule."





"[player], do you not recognize
my voice?"





"Indeed, I am the one who guided you here.
I am the [red]King of Red Lions[white]."





"There was no need for me to reveal my true
identity to you so long as that blade,
the Master Sword, could defeat Ganon..."





"But now...both of you must listen to me."





"Once, long ago, this land of Hyrule was
turned into a world of shadows by [red]Ganon[white],
who sought to obtain the [red]power of the
gods[white] for his own evil ends."





"My power alone could not stop the fiend,
and our only choice was to leave the fate
of the kingdom in the hands of the gods...

When the [red]gods[white] heard our pleas, they chose
to [red]seal away[white] not only [red]Ganon[white], but [red]Hyrule
[white]itself...and so, with a torrential downpour
of rains from the heavens...
Our fair kingdom was soon buried beneath
the waves, forgotten at the [red]bottom of
the ocean[white]."





"Yet all was not lost. For the gods knew
that to seal the people away with the
kingdom would be to grant Ganon's wish
for the destruction of the land."





"So, before the sealing of the kingdom,
the gods chose those who would build a
new country and commanded them to take
refuge on the mountaintops."





"Those people were your [red]ancestors[white]."





"Hundreds of years have passed since then...



So long as Ganondorf was not revived,
Hyrule would remain below, never waking
from its slumber."





"Tetra, come to me."





"This [red]necklace[white] you wear is part of a [red]sacred
treasure [white]called the [red]Triforce of Wisdom[white],
which has been passed down for many ages
within the royal family of Hyrule."





"Your mother passed this down to you and
instructed you to treasure it...and to guard
it with your life.

Am I not correct?"





"The [red]Triforce of Wisdom[white] is none other than
the sacred [red]power of the gods[white] that we have
kept from Ganon's clutches for so many
long years.
The gods placed upon your ancestors the
task of [red]protecting it from evil's grasp[white]."





"You, too, must abide by the [red]laws of the
past[white]...and so the time has come for me to
teach you the fate into which you were
born, the very reason that you live."





"My...[wait=10]fate..."





"You are the true heir of the royal family of
Hyrule...the last link in the bloodline."





"...Zelda?[wait=20] I'm...[wait=10]a princess?"





"You are confused, aren't you?
I suppose such is to be expected."





"[player]!



I am terribly sorry that you have been
caught up in these events."





"But now that it is known that Tetra is
indeed Princess Zelda...


Ganon will be searching frantically for this
child in an attempt to get the [red]power of the
gods[white] that she possesses. He will not rest
until he has found her."





"If he succeeds, my ancient kingdom under
the sea will be turned into a land of
shadow and despair...and so will the world
you know above the waves."





"[player], I need you to lend me your
strength in this dark hour.


I have a suspicion about what has caused
the Master Sword to [red]lose its power[white]."





"I need for you to come with me back to the
lands above the water and return the
[red]power to repel evil[white] to the Master Sword!"





"Zelda..."





"It is far too dangerous for you to join us in
this task."





"Fortunately, this sacred chamber is not yet
known to Ganon.


It is my wish that you wait here in hiding
until we return."





"[player]! We must go!"





"[player]...[wait_dismiss=60]"





"Everything that's happened to you and
your poor sister...
It's all been my fault."





"[wait=60]...I'm so sorry."





"[player]...



[wait=30]Be careful..."





"[player], listen well..."





"The fact that the Master Sword lost the
power to repel evil suggests to me that
[red]something has happened[white] to the [red]sages [white]who
infused the blade with the gods' power."





"The sages should be here in [red]Hyrule[white]...in the
[red]Wind Temple [white]to the [red]north[white] and the [red]Earth
Temple[white] to the [red]south[white], praying to the gods."





"You must head for these [red]two temples[white] to see
what has happened to the sages and
attempt to find a way to recover the
power to repel evil."





"Unfortunately, Ganon seems to have erected
some sort of magical barrier down here in
Hyrule, blocking our path to the temples."





"But...each [red]temple [white]should have [red]another
entrance[white] high upon Hyrule's mountaintops,
which are now [red]islands [white]above the sea."





"As always, I shall mark these places
on your [red]Sea Chart[white]."





"Now then... If we stay here much longer,
we shall draw our enemy's attention to
Princess Zelda's whereabouts. We must
return to the surface immediately!"





"[player], do you know the legend
of the Hero of Time?"





"Once, long ago, he defeated Ganon and
brought peace to the Kingdom of Hyrule...


A piece of the [red]Triforce [white]was given to the
Hero of Time and he kept it safe, much as
Zelda kept hers."





"That sacred piece is known as the
[red]Triforce of Courage[white].


When the Hero of Time was called to
embark on another journey and left the
land of Hyrule, he was separated from the
elements that made him a hero.
It is said that at that time, the Triforce of
Courage was split into [red]eight shards[white] and
hidden throughout the land."





"It seems you already have some knowledge
of these [red]shards[white]...


If you are able to collect [red]all[white] of them, they
will fuse together and complete the piece of
the Triforce, once again opening the
passage through the waves to Hyrule.
You must search for the remaining [red]shards[white]."





"Even I do not know where they rest, but
this much I do know: [red]they lie hidden
[white]somewhere in this [red]Great Sea[white].

The [red]Triforce of Courage[white] is the only key that
will once again open the doorway to Hyrule.


You must search for it."





"You have done well, [player]."





"It would seem the gods have acknowledged
you to be a true hero."





"But this does not mean your trials have
ended here..."





"Once you take your first step into the world
beyond the ring of light you see shimmering
in the waves before you...

Your true trial will begin."





"Are you ready, [player]?"





"Then hang on tightly!"





"You are probably wondering where we are,
aren't you?"





"Unfortunately, there is not enough time for
me to explain it to you now..."





"Once you are able to strike down Ganon
with the [red]item[white] you obtain in this [red]castle[white]...


...All will be made clear to you."





"Trust in my words! See what awaits you
in the castle!"





"[player], it is still too early for you
to come to this place.


Even though the power to repel evil has
been returned to the Master Sword, you
will not be able to return to [red]Hyrule[white]
until the [red]Triforce[white] is [red]complete[white]."





"Quickly! You must now think only of finding
the [red]eight shards [white]and completing the
Triforce of Courage."





"You cannot defeat Ganon until the power to
repel evil has been returned to the
Master Sword."





"I, too, am worried about Zelda, as you are...



But for now, you must focus on recovering
the Master Sword's power."





"Hurry, [player]!"





"Well done, [player]. You must show
the Triforce piece you have assembled to
the gods."





"Oh! What is this? There, on your hand_the
Triforce piece now [red]dwells [white]within you!"





"It is the Triforce of Courage_proof
that you are indeed the [red]true hero[white]."





"You have controlled the wind and crossed
the seas, and here, near the end of your
quest, the power of the gods has been
bestowed upon you...
Surely, from this moment on, you shall be
known as the [red]Hero of Winds[white]..."





"[player]! Hero of Winds!"





"Go forth!



To Hyrule! To Zelda's side!"





"You have done well to find your way
to this place."





"Oh, chosen one..."





"Accept this final challenge..."





"The path can now be opened."





"Oh, chosen one..."





"What will now come to pass is tied to your
fate_to the path that you have chosen."





"Go forward with caution."





"[player]?
[wait=20][player], is that you?"





"It is! I'm pleased to see you're OK."





"[wait=30]I must say...



You've traveled far for one with no wings..."





"[wait=30]And your sister? Is she..."





"[wait=30]Is that so?
[wait=30]Well, don't worry too much.
I'm sure she'll hang in there."





"I have an idea, [player].
Would you like to meet our [red]chieftain[white]?


I've told my people here about you, and
all of us Rito are very concerned.


I'm certain the chieftain will befriend you
and lend you the aid of our aerie.


It's settled, then! I'll fly on ahead and let
everyone know you're coming.


Come inside, [player]!



I'll be waiting!"





"Well? Have you discovered the cause of
the great Valoo's anger?"





"Ah. So, you are [player], are you?



[red]Quill [white]has told me all about you.[red]



[white][wait=10]A troubling tale, indeed..."





"I insist that you let us know if there is
anything we can do to help you.


We shall do everything in our power to
assist you."





"However, in the meantime, we have a
problem of our own to deal with..."





"When you arrived on the island, did you
notice the raging [red]dragon [white]perched atop
the mountain?"





"As you can see, we of the [red]Rito tribe [white]are
profoundly connected to the sky. We make
our livings on the airways."





"We do so by the graces of the sky spirit,
[red]Valoo[white]. When a Rito reaches adulthood, he
or she journeys to the top of[red] Dragon Roost[white]
to receive a [red]scale [white]from the great dragon.
It is this scale that enables the Rito to
grow his or her wings."





"Recently, however, the once-gentle Valoo
has grown violent and unpredictable.


Sadly, we can no longer approach him."





"If this continues, the [red]fledglings [white]who are of
age will never be able to receive scales
from[red] Valoo [white]on[red] Dragon Roost[white].

They will remain [red]wingless[white], and in time,
our very way of life will be threatened."





"As chieftain of the Rito, my first
responsibility is to solve this problem.


My apologies, but I must ask you to wait
for our assistance until this is done.
Will you do so?"





"Chieftain, what do you think of consulting
[player] with regards to your son,
[red]Prince Komali[white]?

As you can see, [player] is a
gallant young lad!


I feel certain that Prince Komali would
open his heart to him and speak freely
of his fears and worries."





"[wait=30][size=75]That may be..."





"Let me be direct. My son,[red] Komali[white], is[red] of the
age to earn his wings[white]...


Yet...he is weak, in some ways...and in light
of the current situation, he may just[red] give
up on ever getting them[white]..."





"What say you?



Will you share some of your courage
with my son?"





"Will you meet with my son?"





"Treasure Chart 16"





"Treasure Chart 17"





"I thank you!



We shall do our best to solve our problem
as quickly as possible, so that we may
better help you with yours."





"I have[red] something [white]I wish for you to[red] give to
my son[white].[red]


A young girl [white]named [red]Medli [white]is holding it for
me. Would you find her and take it?"





"I am counting on you!"





"Here, [player], take [red]this [white]with you!



Who knows? It might come in handy."





"You should find [red]Medli [white]in one of the
[red]upper rooms[white].


Leave the great Valoo to us.



In the meanwhile, do your best to aid
[red]Prince Komali[white]!"





"Ah, [player]!
I hoped I would get the chance to thank
you in person.

Medli told me everything. I am extremely
grateful for all that you have done."





"It seems you have helped my son, Komali,
find his courage, as well.


You have done so much for us!"





"I thank you."





"Tell us if there is anything the Rito can do
for you. Anything at all."





"I believe your journey is far from over,
but no matter where you may go, we can
still reach you.

As you travel from island to island, be sure
to check the local [red]postbox[white].


We shall be sure to deliver any [red]letters [white]or
[red]packages addressed to you [white]to the[red] postbox
[white]nearest to you.

Keep your eyes peeled for the [red]moving
postboxes[white], for they have mail within them. 

I trust that is clear."





"We will deliver any letters or packages
[red]addressed to you [white]to the[red] postbox [white]nearest
you. Without fail, I promise you.

You may continue your journey knowing this
to be true."





"Ah, [player]!
I hoped I would get the chance to thank
you in person.

Medli told me everything. I am extremely
grateful for all that you have done."





"It seems you have helped my son, Komali,
find his courage, as well.


You have done so much for us!"





"I thank you."





"By the way, are you using our[red] postboxes[white]?



Well, as you might know, since you left the
island, all[red] letters [white]and[red] packages addressed
to you [white]have been delivered to whatever
[red]postbox [white]was nearest you.
Of course, the system is not perfect_you
tend to move around a lot. So be sure to
check any moving postboxes you find in
your travels. Do not forget!"





"We shall deliver any[red] letters [white]or[red] packages
addressed to you [white]to the[red] postbox [white]nearest
your location.

You may continue your journey knowing this
to be true."





"Ah, [player]!
So you have returned safely.


May I assume that you have been checking
our postboxes?"





"Since you left, our island has been beset
by a plague of monsters, which appear
after the setting of the sun.

Luckily, they have never come during
daylight hours, so you may rest safely. "





"As you can see, when the sun goes down,
monsters appear outside...


Do not worry: the aerie's borders are
well protected, and they cannot get in here.
Please go and rest yourself."





"Make yourself at home."





"Ah, [player]!
It is good to see that you are looking
so hale and hearty."





"Relax and rest your weary spirit."





"Wow! You really DO have [green]green clothes [white]and
a [green]strange-shaped hat[white]...


You're [player], aren't you?"





"Oh, me? I'm an attendant to the great sky
spirit, Valoo. My name is Medli."





"[wait=30]Well, to tell the truth...[wait=10]
I'm not an attendant quite yet. I'm actually
still studying to be one."





"Oh, what am I thinking? Here![red] This [white]is from
the chieftain.


[player], he wants you to[red] give [white]this
directly to[red] Prince Komali[white]."





"The room way in the back on the first floor
is Prince Komali's room. You have to go
down a couple steps to get there."





"By the way, ummmm...
[wait=10]Listen, [player]...


[wait=10]I have a small favor I'd like to ask
of you..."





"Could you please come to the[red] entrance [white]of
[red]Dragon Roost Cavern [white]later?


...I'll explain everything then."





"After you've spoken to Prince Komali,
please come to the [red]entrance [white]of [red]Dragon
Roost Cavern[white]. It's really important.

I'll explain everything then, I promise."





"[player]!
You came to rescue me!


Oh, thank you!"





"I have to tell you what I found out!
This is terrible!


...[red]Some creature [white]is doing [red]awful [white]things to
the great [red]Valoo's tail[white]!


That's why he's so angry!"





"The great Valoo's [red]tail [white]hangs down [red]into the
room right below here[white].


There's got to be something in there..."





"I wonder if those mean monsters who
captured me have something to do with it..."





"We've got to do something! Now! Before it's
too late!"





"I'll go and tell everyone what's happening!"





"Here, [player]!
Use this to get out of here!


It's what I used to get this far.



It's a[red] device [white]we Rito used [red]before we
evolved wings[white]."





"Here, [player]. Climb up on that
little ledge over there, so I can show
you something."





"Grab this branch with the [red]Grappling Hook
[white]and you can swing over there to get out
of this area!

When you aim at a branch that you can
latch onto, [yellow][starburst] [white]will appear. Remember that!


Don't you worry about me, [player].
Get going!"





"Hey, you actually came!



I'm really sorry for bringing you to such a
dangerous place. I had to! I wouldn't have
asked if I didn't need help desperately."





"You see this place? There used to be a
spring here, surrounded by a beautiful
pond... It was peaceful and lovely...

But then the great Valoo...
He became so angry, and...


In his rage, he shook the mountain and this
boulder crashed down, plugging the [red]spring[white].
You can see the result.

[wait=30]Oh, but where is my mind? Tell me,
how was Prince Komali?"





"[size=75][wait=30]Oh... That doesn't sound right... Not at all..."





"I may be partially to blame for the bad
turn that Prince Komali's taken..."





"See, Prince Komali's grandmother was the
great Valoo's former[red] attendant[white].


She was an amazing woman. I was honored
to have her as my teacher...


She was kind and brave, and unsurpassed
in her dealings with the great Valoo.
I'm not yet worthy of being mentioned
in the same breath as her.
If only I'd possessed some of her strength,
I'm sure Prince Komali would have felt
more secure."





"[player], I'm sorry to ask this...
but I need your help!"





"I want to go to the[red] small shrine [white]that's
near the peak of [red]Dragon Roost[white], but that
ledge over there is so high...

If I could get some [red]wind under my wings[white],
I'm sure I could get up there."





"So..."





"Will you help me?
[two_choices]Sure
I don't think so"





"Oh, please? I wouldn't ask if it wasn't
important! It's just that...I'm not that good
at [red]flying [white]yet..."





"Whew... [wait=10][draw_instant]Thank you so much![draw_char]"





"OK, [red]pick me up[white]."





"Then face that [red]ledge[white] and toss me!"





"The atmospheric currents are really messed
up, so pay close attention to the [red]direction
of the wind[white]."





"All right, I'm ready!
Don't hold back, now!
Throw me as hard as you can!"





"I'm... I'm fiiiine! That...didn't really hurt.
[wait=10]What was I saying? Oh, yeah! Once...
Once more! With the wind! Toss away!
Please!"





"OK, that didn't exactly work.
Let's try once more. Use the [red]wind [white]and
[red]throw [white]me up to that [red]ledge[white]!"





"Oh, thank goodness!



I had a bad feeling that you weren't going
to come back, [player]."





"Remember, [red]use the wind [white]to launch me up to
the [red]top of that ledge[white]!"





"Oh, thank you!"





"I think now I'll be able to climb [red]Dragon
Roost [white]and meet with the great [red]Valoo[white]!"





"Don't worry, I'll be fine!



I may be just an apprentice attendant, but
I can [red]understand [white]some of the [red]great
Valoo's language[white]."





"[size=75]I'm not exactly bursting with confidence, but..."





"Look, if anything happens to me..."





"Please look after Prince Komali!"





"[red]This [white]is all I have to give you. I know it's
not much, but please take it!"





"Oh, and please don't tell anyone that I'm
climbing [red]Dragon Roost[white]!


It'll be our secret, OK?"





"Well, good luck!


...To both of us."





"When you meet Prince Komali, please don't
get offended by his manner.


He has no bad intentions, I promise."





"Huh? Who are you supposed to be?"





"What do you want from me, huh?
I... I don't want to talk to anyone right now!"





"What do you want me to do with that, huh?"





"A letter?
[wait=30]From my father?"





"Oh, sure, telling me to be brave is easy
enough for him...


It's not like he's the one who went through
that horrible experience... It's not like HE
still has to go get a scale from [red]Valoo[white]."





"You're in this letter, too, you know...



Poking your nose in other people's
business... You're nosy, aren't you?"





"Sorry, but I really don't feel like going to
see Valoo right now.


I mean, how am I supposed to get a scale
from him when he's so upset?
"





"What? Are you trying to say that YOU can
calm Valoo down?


Psssssh! That's just a big, fat lie!
It's easy to SAY you can do anything!
Bragging doesn't cost a thing!

I'll tell you what: If you can find me
someone who can get past all the obstacles
on [red]Dragon Roost [white]to get to [red]Valoo[white]...

THEN I'll listen to [red]anything [white]you say!"





"What?"





"Oh, [red]this[white]...?"





"It's strange... Holding this calms me down.
I forget all the bad things."





"It's so pretty, isn't it? It's called [red]Din's
Pearl[white]. My grandma gave it to me."





"My grandma used to be Valoo's [red]attendant[white].
She was the only person on the island who
understood [red]Valoo's language[white]."





"Oh, Grandma... If she were here, I know she
could calm Valoo down. I just know it..."





"But my father and the rest? No matter how
hard they try...they'll fail. I know it.


[red]No one [white]else can [red]calm Valoo down[white].
It's impossible..."





"What? What is it, huh?
Listen, you can stare all you want, but
I'm not giving this to you.

This is MY treasure. You understand?



I'm not going to just hand it over to some
[red]do-nothing [white]guy, am I?"





"What?"





"You can stop staring any time now!
I'm not giving this to you!"





"There's no one out there who can get [red]Valoo
[white]to [red]settle down[white]...so just go away and let
me be miserable by myself."





"Master [player], you really helped
us out of a pickle!"





"Am I right, Akoot?"





"You could not be MORE right, Skett!"





"You saved our tailfeathers!"





"Master [player], I must thank you so
very much!"





"What are you, mute, Skett? Could you not
show a little appreciation?"





"I am working on it, Akoot!"





"Er... Thank you oh so very much.
Take care of yourself."





"I believe that Prince Komali has gone to
Dragon Roost to study."





"Is that not right?
Akoot! Look alive!"





"Yes! Yes, of course! I deem you are
absolutely correct, Skett."





"He told us to give you his regards,
Master [player]."





"Master [player], Medli is busy with
her attendant studies."





"Is that not correct, Skett?
...Skett?"





"Oh, that is quite correct, Akoot!"





"Please come back and see her some
other time."





"Master [player], I believe that
Prince Komali has gone out..."





"Am I right or am I right, Akoot?"





"I believe you are right, Skett."





"He should be returning before too much
longer, so do not worry."





"Master [player], if you are looking
for Medli, I believe she is atop the cliff
just outside."





"Do I speak the truth, Skett?"





"You do, Akoot, as usual! She is right in the
same old spot!"





"If you step outside near where she is,
you should be able to hear the song she
is playing."





"Master [player], do not push yourself
too hard."





"Akoot! Speak up! Is there nothing you want
to say to Master [player]?"





"Of course there is, Skett!
And that something is as follows..."





"Do your best!
We are with you all the way!"





"Master [player], you know Medli,
do you not?"





"Well, we cannot find her!
I am not lying, am I, Skett?"





"You most certainly are not, Akoot!"





"Now, I do not think there is any need for
alarm, but let us know if you see her."





"As you're from off-island, allow me tell
you about the [red]Dragon Roost[white]. Even in the
best of times, it's a dangerous place with
all those [red]bomb flowers [white]growing everywhere.
...And now, it's even more perilous. It's so
bad that the [red]bomb flowers [white]themselves have
all [red]dried up[white]. The \"great and wonderful
Valoo\" has created quite a mess!"





"We used to have to worry only about [red]bomb
flowers[white] when we went to get our scales.


Now, climbing's not even an issue since we
can't even get close to the mountain.
You think I'm joking? Go and take a look
for yourself.
The [red]bomb flowers [white]that marked the entrance
to [red]Dragon Roost Cavern [white]have all wilted
because the earth is so dry. They're not
producing [red]bomb-fruit [white]at all. It's sad, really."





"I guess it's to be expected in this heat, but
just take a look down there!
[red]Dragon Roost Pond [white]is completely dried up!"





"The pond came from this [red]bubbling spring[white].
It was such a beautiful little pond...


Now it's so arid that even the [red]bomb flowers
[white]have completely dried up.


It's just so hot...
I'm sure the chieftain and those guys are
having a tough time checking things out,
but it's tough for us guards, too."





"[player], do you know Medli?"





"Just now, some fellow told me that he
saw some unfamiliar [red]creatures [white]near
[red]Dragon Roost Cavern[white]...

He said that they [red]grabbed [white]a girl that
looked like [red]Medli[white]...


...Which is odd, because I know Medli can't
fly well enough to get to the Dragon Roost
Cavern entrance by herself. So I figure it
must be some sort of mix-up.
It IS a bit disconcerting, though..."





"This whole business of someone resembling
[red]Medli [white]getting[red] snatched [white]near [red]Dragon Roost
Cavern [white]has got to some kind of mistake.

Still, I'm going to wait here for a while and
watch things extra-carefully.


Don't worry, [player].



Just look after Prince Komali."





"We used to have such nice breezes blowing
through here... Now the air is crazy.


I'm positive the strange winds are a result
of the[red] wind god's [white]anger.


See, there's an important[red] shrine [white]below here
that got broken...and now we're paying
the price. What cursed luck..."





"We Rito cannot live without the wind.



Before we take to the skies, we always go
down and visit the [red]wind god's shrine[white].
That's the way it's always been."





"Every year, the Rito sponsor a Bird-Man
Contest on that island off to the east.


I wonder if we'll have one this year, what
with the current situation on the island..."





"No time to waste!



Everyone's so busy with the great Valoo
that we're running short of delivery
personnel. It's a mad-house!

Ah, well, back to work!"





"If you want to get to [red]Dragon Roost Cavern[white],
I've got some bad news for you...


The bridge is out. There's no way to even
get inside. I'm sure you'll understand
once you've seen it for yourself.

As for [red]swimming [white]across, well...
You need water for that, and the pond's
all dried up...

No need to panic, though! I'm sure the
chieftain will think of something."





"Sorry to tell you this, but you can no longer
get to [red]Dragon Roost Cavern[white]. Even if you
were of a mind to swim across, the pond's
empty. That's right, it's bone dry..."





"Dragon Roost just up and stopped shaking!



I wonder if this means the great Valoo's
feeling better..."





"This is great news for the fledglings!
Now they can climb Dragon Roost and get
their scales!"





"Long time, no see.



How've you been?"





"Please, make yourself at home."





"Long time, no see.



How've you been?"





"Don't want to stay outside, huh?



Well, make yourself at home."





"I was just thinking that it hasn't been quite
so hot lately, and what do you know?
The pond's gone back to normal!"





"The pond's filled up again! We've got to get
busy repairing the bridge!"





"Hey! Welcome back!"





"Apparently there are still some weird things
up on Dragon Roost."





"Oh, it's you..."





"The night's full of dangers, you know.
It's better to stay inside."





"You can hear that song coming from [red]up on
the cliff[white], can't you?


Mmmm... Such beautiful tone.
Medli's really gotten good."





"[red]The top of that cliff [white]is Medli's special spot.



That girl really is a hard worker. She's
beginning to fill the shoes of her teacher."





"Wasn't Medli [red]on top of that cliff outside[white]?"





"It's starting to get dark... Could you go and
tell her it's time to come inside?"





"It appears that the great Valoo is in much
better spirits.


Maybe we'll have our annual Bird-Man
Contest after all."





"Ah, I'm off to do some more work!"





"We're holding our traditional Bird-man
Contest on that [red]little island [white]over there.
Why don't you give it a try?"





"Maybe I'll go ahead and take a break
myself..."





"You can go ahead and take a look at
Dragon Roost if you want.


They're still assessing the situation, though,
so I wouldn't go inside."





"They're still checking to see if Dragon
Roost is safe. Wait just a bit more, please."





"Ah, I heard of your trials. Nicely done.
You must be weary!"





"Be careful out there..."





"Ah, nicely done. You must be weary!"





"It's dangerous out at night, so be
extra-careful."





"There appear to be markings that indicate
specific directions."





"It's broken..."





"Yep! That's a miiiiiighty nice breeze!"





"The name's Zephos.
I'm the [red]god of winds[white].


So, you're the new Wind Waker, are you?"





"Great, great. For a beginner, you've got a
nice wind-sense about you.
I like you, kid!"





"That tune you just picked up?
Well, it gives you [red]control [white]over the [red]direction
the wind blows[white]."





"Depending on how it's used, wind can be a
good thing...or a very bad thing. You want
an example of it being a bad thing, then
you should see my brother."





"It saddens me to say that my brother,
[red]Cyclos[white], is miffed about his monument here
being broken, and now he spends his time
creating cyclones to torment people with."





"So if you encounter any cyclones at sea,
chastise my brother for me, will you?


And THAT...is my request for you!"





"That's a heck of an arm you've got there!"





"And what an eye! No one's ever been able
to spot me in there before now!"





"You obviously have mastery of the air.
And now that we've established that you're
quite the Wind Waker..."





"Let's see if you can handle this!"





"Bah! What's wrong? So! You can't keep up
with marvelous me after all, can you?
Oh, all right! Fine! I'll show it to
you one more time!"





"Waaaaa-hoooooooooooooo!



In the hands of a Wind Waker like you,
my adorable little [red]cyclones [white]will be as
happy as can be!"





"If you need to move like the wind over the
ocean deeps, just call on my [red]cyclones[white]!"





"Well, I guess I'll head for home now!
See you on down the road!"





"[player]!"





"Well, Prince Komali? Don't you have
something you want to say?"





"Um, I heard everything from Medli...



[wait=20][player]... [wait=20]Thank you so much!
I'm sorry I mistrusted you!"





"I hope I can be like you someday,
[player]."





"[draw_instant]You will, Komali! I just know it![draw_char]
[wait=30]Right, [player]?"





"So, [player]? ...Here!"





"I want you to take this, [player]!"





"Giving you the thing I value most will
give me the courage I need to stand up to
bad things!"





"The great Valoo is grateful to you,
[player]."





"O Hero! Thank you!
O Hero! Use the wind god's wind!"





"Use the [red]wind god's[white]...wind?



That's what he said, but I don't understand.
I wonder what it means?"





"The wind god's wind... I wonder if what
he's talking about has anything to do with
the [red]Wind Shrine [white]that's through that tunnel..."





"Oh, I almost forgot! The great Valoo also
names you, [player], a true [red]hero[white]."





"I agree with him. As far as we're concerned,
[player], you really ARE a [red]hero[white]!"





"Well, I'm going to go and visit Valoo!



I'll come and see you sometime_with the
best pair of wings ever!"





"Hey! Prince Komali!"





"Thanks so much, [player].



See you again someday!"





"Hey! I know you! Yeah!



You're the adventure guy. Sailing from
island to island. Action! Excitement! Right?"





"So, with all the adventuring you do...
Did you happen to find a [red]Golden Feather[white]?


My girlfriend, she's wanted one of those
things for the longest time.


And actually, I kind of promised that I'd
send one to her..."





"I have no idea why she wants a [red]Golden
Feather[white], but you know how it is..."





"It doesn't matter why, really. I just want to
see her happy. To see her smile, you know?


...Which is why I told her I'd send her one..."





"I don't get to see her very often, and I know
she's been a bit lonely...


I just want to make her happy."





"I'm really rooting for you, adventure-guy!
Get out there and do your best!"





"I'm going to write a letter right away and
send this off!


Wow! I'm really excited! And if I'm excited,
then SHE'LL be ECSTATIC!"





"Aw, wow! That's spectacular!
Are you going to let me have it?


You really are a good guy, aren't you?
The best!"





"Hey! That's what my girlfriend wants!
A [red]Golden Feather[white]!"





"So, how many of those do you have?"





"Yeah, well, when you get [red]20 [white]of those,
would you let me have them? I know she
only wanted one, but if I give my girl
20 of them, I'll be loving life!
I'd like to get out and gather them on my
own, but...


Well, you know, I've got guard duty and all."





"So, are you really going to let me have
[red]20 [white]of those?
[two_choices]Sure
I don't think so"





"I guess I understand...
That's a bit too many, isn't it?


But I promised, and...I want to be able
to keep my word!"





"Really? Are you sure? Yessss!



I'm going to stick these little beauties in a
letter and send them off right away!


I'm going to tell her all about you, too!
I'm so happy! Seriously!"





"It's not much, but please accept this."





"Whoa! You've got some cool stuff!"





"Dear [player],
 I recently received some [red]Golden Feathers
 [white]from my boyfriend, who mentioned you.

 I'm something of a bird enthusiast, so I
 know how hard it must've been to get all
 of these feathers.

 I want you to be as happy as we are,
 [player], so I'm sending you this
 [red][heart] [white]as a token of our affection."





"[draw_instant]You got a [red]Piece of Heart[white]![draw_char]
[wait=10]Collect four to form one Heart
Container. More Heart Containers
mean more life energy! How exciting!"





"Oh, [player]!
You're OK!"





"You know, Prince Komali's been asking me
all about your adventures, [player]."





"I can rest easy now that I've seen you safe
and sound with my own eyes."





"Prince Komali's turned into a fine young
adult, hasn't he?


Recently, he's even begun doing things on
his own, without my guidance.


...Every conversation still ends up centered
on you, though, [player]."





"Watching Prince Komali grow up fills me
with pride...but it makes me a little sad,
as well..."





"I wonder if this is how a mother feels...

"





"Oh, but just listen to me go on!
How weird I must sound!
[wait=20][size=75]Hee hee..."





"Well, I'd better continue practicing so that I
can be useful around here, too!"





"Performing music like this is an important
duty of an attendant."





"This [red]instrument [white]is called one of fate's tools."





"Prince Komali's grandmother saw me
carrying it one day and called out to
me to stop. She'd seen my fate in the
curves of the instrument, you see."





"She eventually became my teacher, and
that's how I became the attendant you
see before you today."





"So, now you understand why I need to hurry
and improve my skills, so that I may help
the aerie."





"Hey, is that the [red]Wind Waker[white]?! Wow!"





"[player], will you conduct me?"





"I wonder how I'll do..."





"What song shall we perform?"





"Incredible, [player]!



How was my performance?"





"[player], let's play another song."





"Are you finished? Is that it?
Oh, that's too bad."





"For [skull_necklace_count], I'll pay [red][beedle_rupee_offer][white]!



You sure you want to sell?
[two_choices]Yes
Maybe not"





"Hmm... What a mysterious song...
It sounds so...familiar.


It's almost as if something I've forgotten
is trying to be [wait=20]remembered..."





"Oh... I feel...[wait_dismiss=30]"





"Just now, a sage spoke to me.
She spoke so gently..."





"There's something...something that
I must do."





"[player]...



Thanks to you, I've been awakened to the
knowledge that I'm a [red]sage of the
Earth Temple[white]."





"[wait=20]There's actually something that I can do to
help this world. It's incredible..."





"[wait=20]I bet my teacher knew all about this..."





"[player], please... You must take me
to the [red]Earth Temple[white]."





"We must hurry and wake the [red]power to repel
evil [white]that sleeps within the Master Sword."





"Let's go now, quickly and quietly."





"Oh, Komali... I just want him to remember
me as a simple attendant..."





"[player], the [red]power to repel evil [white]is
not yet fully awakened."





"To complete the awakening of the Master
Sword, you must go to the [red]Wind Temple [white]for
one more prayer."





"Now, [player]...



Step into the [red]light [white]behind you and return to
the surface. Your next duty is to find the
[red]sage [white]of the [red]Wind Temple[white]."





"I will remain here and continue to pray.



You must hurry!"





"...And [player]!"





"Um... [wait=30]About Prince Komali...
[wait=20]Please watch over him for me."





"Well, now! I've not seen your young face
before. Nope. Don't believe so."





"Hmm?



You wouldn't be here in response to our
posting for some part-time help, would you?


[two_choices]Yes
No"





"No? Well, too bad for us, I guess.
Can't say I'm happy to hear that.


With everyone out patrolling the island at
night, we've been a bit shorthanded."





"No? Well, that's not any kind of good
news. In fact, it's bad.


The thing is, this hoopla with the great
Valoo has left me without enough help."





"Ooh, excellent. That's good. But first,
to see if I can use you or not, I need to
give you a little test. Just a small one."





"Match the [red]seal [white]on the envelope with the
[red]same icon [white]on the shelf and throw the letter
onto that shelf. Real easy. Simple.

Use [control_stick] to select a shelf and press [a] to
throw a letter. Like I said: simple."





"Is that clear?
[two_choices]Sure
Not really"





"OK, now listen up..."





"[red]Before time runs out[white], you have to sort at
least [red]ten letters[white]!"





"Give it your best shot!"





"[red][post_office_game_letter_count] letters[white]! Great! Good! Terrific!



You pass!"





"OK, you get [red]one Rupee [white]for every two letters,
so that comes to a grand total of [red][post_office_game_rupee_reward][white],
am I right?"





"Come back anytime. I mean it. Anytime.
The more letters you sort, the more you'll
earn! Not a bad deal. For both of us."





"Hmm, not even one... Shocking. Crazy.



Sorry, but it seems you're not cut out for
this sort of work. You can always try again
some other time, though. It's almost
guaranteed you'll do better than this."





"One letter... Yikes.



Sorry, but it seems you're not cut out for

"[red][post_office_game_letter_count] letters[white]... [wait=20]Too bad. Unfortunate.



Luck wasn't with you this time, I'm afraid.
Try again some other time."





"Are you looking for work?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"No?



Well, we're looking for help, so tell anyone
you know who needs work, will you?"





"Are you looking for work?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"Oh, I see... Disappointing. Sad.
Think it over, will you?"





"You've got spirit! Excellent! Great!



Well, I'm going to give you that simple
test again... You know the drill."

The better you do, the [red]higher [white]your salary
will become! That's economics."

of distressing. Disturbing. Bad.


Are you feeling a bit under the weather?"

[red]Three Rupees [white]per letter comes to [red][post_office_game_rupee_reward][white].
How's that sound?"

You've had a rough time, [player].

you try again, though!"

My mistake, man."





"C'mon... You really ARE
[player], aren't you?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"Really? Truly, man?"





"Just go ahead and put that in the
[red]postbox[white], man. Thanks."





"Hey, there! Long time no see, man!"





"What's up, man?"





"What's up, man?"





"Look, man, I have a big favor to ask of you.
You have just GOT to show me the
legendary [red]twenty-five-letter sort[white]! Pleeease!"





"So, what do you say, man?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"Seriously?!?"





"I just really wanted to see it, man..."





"Ummm... Have you had a chance to mail
that letter to my mom?


I'm counting on you, man!"





"You got something from my mom?



After I told her not to bug you and
everything! Sheesh!"





"My co-workers let me in on your little
secret, man...


All letters addressed to you are specially
delivered to the [red]postbox [white]closest to you!
No matter what island you happen to be on!
[draw_instant]That's so cool, man![draw_char]
"





"I've heard all about the work you did here.



You've really been through some rough
times, man. Way to go."





"To my son's superior,



 Thank you very much for looking after my
 boy. This isn't much, but I hope you'll
 accept it all the same.

 I politely request your continued kindness
 toward my son.

"Listen, man, you're not one of the native
islanders, are you?"





"My problem is, I just have no idea how I'm
supposed to get up there, and I have a job
interview..."





"I've got a bad feeling about this, man.



How am I supposed to get up there?"





"Look, don't be mad at us! It's not our fault
that we absolutely gotta have [red]bombs[white] to
get the treasure we're after!

How about you just think of it as payback
for the nasty little monopoly you've been
running here, yeah?"





"So I bet you're thinking it was foolhardy to
ask pirates to pay such an outrageous
price, huh?[wait=10] Yup. I bet you are."





"...You know, Gonzo, I still can't get over
that bit of fast-talking you pulled to get
that information out of the postman!"





"Huh? ...Oh! Oh, yeah! That was smooth!"





"I tell you, the minute I set my eyes on that
[player], I just knew he was hiding
something back at [red]Outset[white], yeah?

So when I saw that postman, I just
pretended like I was all worried about
the kid and stuff...

And presto! He spills the beans!"





"Good work, Gonzo! Really! Just top notch!
It's funny, though... I'm thinking this is
maybe the first time you've shown such
wit... Such cunning..."





"...You know, with your cunning and Miss
Tetra's smarts... If you two got married and
had a kid...

...That kid would be the greatest pirate to
ever sail the seas! Yup! The greatest!"





"You[wait=10] idiot!
[wait=10]Keep your mouth shut, yeah?
[wait=10]Don't be so stupid!"





"Miss Tetra! Are you listening to this nitwit?[wait=10]
Can't you dock him some pay or something?"





"Quit goofing off, both of you!"





"Keep your childish jokes to yourselves and
get those [red]bombs[white] back to the ship!


The second you're done loading them up,
we're setting sail for [red]Outset Island[white]!"





"Whaaat!? Miss! We have to leave
immediately? But it's been so long since
we were on shore!"





"We need to fill our bellies with some good
eating, yeah? How about we grub tonight
and shove off tomorrow morning instead?"





"I mean... Uh, I-I'm fine either way, of course!
[wait=10][draw_instant]Whatever you say is fine, Miss, is what I
mean to say![draw_char]"





"...It's just that, the boys were so excited
to come to town, yeah? And I can't help but
think it would be awful hard on them to
leave so soon without a proper layover."





"So, what say we set sail tomorrow, yeah?
What do you say, Miss?
[wait=10]That treasure isn't going anywhere!"





"You're with me, right, boys?!
Who's for a night of fun?"





"[size=150]........."





"You're all fools, do you know that?
You saw that demolished island!
You saw the senseless destruction.

We have to hurry on to Outset, or the
same thing could happen there!"





"Huh?



Not to be disrespectful, but by the sound of
things, you're worried more about that
island than the treasure, Miss..."





"Don't be ridiculous!
I want, you know...
[size=75]the treasure..."





"All right! Fine! Have it your way! We can
leave town tomorrow, you big babies.


But we're setting sail at first light, so no
sleeping in! Understood?"





"[size=150]Aye-aye!"





"Say there, brother, what was
[red]today's password[white], again?"





"Mako! Are you serious? You forgot already?
You're so useless."





"Today's password is [red][pirate_password][white], yeah?
Remember?"





"You know that Niko won't let you in if you
don't say it exactly right!
[size=75]And he's real picky about it...
So I'll say it once more..."





"Today's password is
[red][pirate_password][white], yeah?"





"[red][pirate_password][white], eh?"





"Right, right! You may enter!"





"No! No! That's completely wrong!
Now scram, non-pirate!"





"[size=150]Who can't walk the plank?"





"[size=150]What do pirates love
more than the sea?"





"[size=150]The ship's only tooth is a...?"





"[size=150]Who cleans pirates' ears?"





"[size=150]How do you treat a shark?"





"[size=150]I can sail upon the water
or be filled with it. I am a..."





"Oh! [player]!
My old swabbie, [player]!"





"So you're alive?



All the other pirates said you got done
in by that bird-monster in the Forsaken
Fortress, so I thought...

Never mind what I thought! You're alive!"





"Oh, I get it now! You came back because
you missed me so much!


I had no idea you wanted to be my swabbie
so badly! I see, I see..."





"Well, after you left, I went back to being
the bottom rung on the ladder...which is
why I'm stuck here while everyone else is in
town having fun and eating and stuff..."





"But...I guess being so worshiped by my
swabbie ought to cheer me up!


All right! Why don't we set you to your next
test, huh? This one is harder than the last!
Good luck! You'll need it, swabbie!"





"You can see there are [red]lanterns hanging
[white]throughout the room, right?


Well, last time when you pressed the
switch, [red]platforms[white] rose up for you to jump
onto, right? Yeah, well, this time, there
[red]aren't any[white]!
Which means you have to [red]jump[white] from [red]one
rope[white] to [red]the next rope[white]! Pretty tough..."





"And that's not all! This time, I've put a
[red]gate[white] on this [red]door[white], too!


The switch opens the [red]gate[white], but it'll [red]close[white] if
you don't get here [red]before time runs out[white].
Run out of time, and you'll have to try it
again, little swabbie!"





"The [red]switch[white] that opens the gate is in the
same place as before, so go step on it.


If you get all the way to [red]this side[white] before
time runs out, I'll give you the [red]bombs[white] we
got in town! Yeah, you heard me!

Give it your best shot, swabbie!"





"What?! You've gotta be...
You did it already?!"





"You're... You're incredible!"





"[size=75]This isn't good... I've never even passed this test...
How could he do it so quickly...?
And make it look so easy?!?"





"[size=75]And if I give this to him, everyone will
know for sure... Oh, I'll be so busted..."





"Uh...OK!"





"You're the best swabbie of all time!
So...I guess I'll just give you the [red]bombs[white]!
Go on! Take 'em!"





"Just don't tell anyone, OK? I'm serious!
Really serious! OK? OK!?!"





"That's mighty courageous of you...trying to
steal treasure from pirates."





"I suppose I should be shocked...but I'm more
amazed that you managed to survive after
being tossed out of that tower..."





"From the look on your face, I have to guess
you haven't saved your sister yet, huh?


You don't give things much thought, do
you? You just rush in, never thinking how
badly things could go for you.

Like just now... The only reason you got
what you did was because we left a
simple-minded little rat like Niko behind to
look after things.
No one else would have parted with our
treasure so easily, I assure you!"





"And just how do you intend to use those
[red]bombs[white], anyway?


Don't tell me you're going after Jabun's
treasure, too..."





"Right now, [red]Jabun [white]is hiding in a [red]cave at the
back [white]of the [red]island you were born on[white].


But the [red]entrance[white] is blocked by a [red]giant
stone doorway[white]. You can't get in without
[red]breaking down[white] the door."





"We're going to relax in town and eat our
fill of whatever this town has to offer,
but we'll be leaving for Outset first thing in
the morning.
If you manage to find Jabun[red] tonight[white], then I
guess you win.


But if you take too long, we'll come sailing
right by you tomorrow morning! And believe
me, you didn't get ALL of our bombs.

You'd better be quick, kid!"





"Wow! Awesome! You have a stone just like
the one that Miss Tetra has!


Hey, how do you use that thing? Can you
talk to Miss Tetra through that?!
Man! You're so lucky!"





"If you give me that stone, I'll be your
swabbie! I swear I will!


Come on, please! Please give me that stone!
Please! I'm begging here!"

Of course, the auctions are held in the

Do I sense more than a little interest?
Do you wish to join in as well?"

to be doing. I'll be RIGHT back, so can you
just wait here for me?
It'll only take a second!"





"It's true... I know I'm quibbling over
nothing...[wait=10] But being so poor weakens
a person's very soul...

But...it's time I quit making silly excuses
for myself!"





"Thank you so much...[wait=30]"





"Let me at least thank you.
Please take this!"





"Designs that reflect [red]wind[white] are drawn here."





"Don't look at me like that! I didn't steal
it! It washed up on the shore, so I picked
it up. Don't tease me like that!

It's a tiny bottle made of crystal-clear
glass... It's so beautiful.


[size=75]I wish my soul could be that beautiful..."





"Oh! What am I saying?



When you live in poverty, you can say the
cheesiest things without blinking an eye.
...Hmph!"





"So, umm...I guess I should go soon.
My father will start worrying."





"Good-bye, little ally of justice!



[size=75]...and good luck to you."





"...Hmph! That's not funny, you know. I can't
believe you'd try to make a joke out of
this! You're an awful boy!"

"Welcome to you, sir![wait=30]
This way to [red]Windfall's outdoor shop[white],
chock-full of fun and happy products!"





"Thanks to you, I didn't have to sink down
to the level of a common [red]thief[white].


I will never do anything like that again!
Ahhhh... What an amazing feeling!
I've let all of my worries out of my
heart. Wow! I actually feel refreshed!"





"'Bye! Thanks for tonight!"

bargain-loving people for joining us this
evening! Dear me, what a turnout![wait=20]

The [red]auction[white] is about to begin. Yes!
And what do you suppose will pop up
as our item of the evening?![wait=20]

Oh, dear me! I'm so excited I can't stop
sniffling! The calm before the auction storm
always makes my nose run!"





"Let's get to it! This evening, our glorious

"...Oh, my dear, what a prize! At last, the
suspense is over. But all drama aside, you
should know it is extremely rare to even get
a chance to own a fabulous item like this!
It is precious! Quite dear! Very valuable![wait=20]
Yes, yes, yes! Listen well, for I do not lie!"





"My dear! Oh my dear me! As you no-doubt
see, this is the item that [red][auction_character][white]
won in our last auction...[wait=20]

...And yet, for reasons I cannot fathom,
[red][auction_character][white] has since parted with this
fine item, and thus it is once again
appearing in our auction!
But do not worry! This certainly does not
mean the item is subpar. It just means that
clearly this item is worth far more than the
original amount it was purchased for![wait=20]
But just listen to me delay! Enough with
the long-winded explanation..."

The bid is [auction_bid]!
But come now, friends!
I hope you won't let it stop there!"





"Yes, yes, yes! Our current top bidder is the
worthy [red][auction_character][white]! The bid is [auction_bid]!


Do I hear another bid? Come on, my dear
people! Let loose! Let loose!"





"Our top bid is [red][auction_character]'s[white], a bold and
spine-tingling offering of [auction_bid]!
But dear me! Isn't there a lady or gentleman
here willing to bid more than [auction_bid]?
Loosen up those purse strings, good people!
Cast caution to the wind and bid away!"





"[auction_bid]! Very nice! But are you all going
to let [red][auction_character][white] run away with the
prize for a mere [auction_bid]!?[wait=30]?! Truly?!

Dear me, can this be it? Are there any more
bids? Speak up, people! Going once!"





"Time is running out, dear friends!"





"There isn't much time left, good people![wait=30]
Are you done bidding?"

"...But now then! On to business.



For you lucky ones out there, and yes, yes,
also for you not so lucky ones... Let me say
thank you for your participation![wait=30]

"Hm? ...Now, just WHAT are you doing?
Were you listening to us, you scamp?"





"Hmmmmm![wait=30] It looks like you are carrying
a slightly larger [red]wallet[white] around with you,
but still...it is not quite large enough!

If you don't have a really, really big [red]wallet[white],
it will be very difficult for you to carry
enough [red]Rupees [white]to your hardworking friend
[green]Tingle[white]! And that would be terrible!"

at [player]'s [red]bid[white]!"





"Ohhhhhhh! Dear me! The spectacle of it all![wait=30]
[player]! What an incredible [red]bid[white]!
You've sent shockwaves through the auction
house! Can these dear people recover?"





"Incredible! Such passion! Such bidding![wait=30]
[player] steps up with a tremendous
[red]bid[white]![wait=30] He's frozen everyone! Never have I seen
such a powerful display of bidding power!"





"Ohhhhhhhh![wait=15] This is incredible![wait=15]
I never thought it possible, but the bid has
reached the ceiling for this item![wait=15]
No higher [red]bids[white] can be accepted! Dear me![wait=15]"

It's not fair!"

I'm the one who won! I'm number one!"

spring has arrived in my wintry world!"

"You won't catch me losing to some kid!"





"Whuh?! This is terrible! Ahem! AAAA-HEM!
...Clearly there's been some kind of awful
mistake here! I demand an investigation!"





"The key to winning the auction is to be
right in the thick of all the [red]bidding[white].
Be aggressive! It's the only way!"





"For example, try upping the [red]bid [white]by more
than just a few Rupees. You need pretty
deep pockets, of course, but...

If you play it right, your move may just be
such a mental shock to the other bidders
that they don't know what to do!"





"If you manage to shock them, they won't
be able to bid until they snap out of it.
Then you can get things for cheaper than
they would normally go! Neat trick, huh?"





"What? You already knew all that? Well.
...I guess I underestimated you. Sorry."





"So, I guess the objective would be to raise
it by [red]10%[white]...or maybe even [red]20%[white]?"

It's been ten years since I began my now
legendary studies of the Chu Jelly. I must
begin mixing this [red]new potion[white] before my first
new inspiration in years vanishes!"





"...[wait=15]It...[wait=15] It's ready at last.[wait=15]
My new...[wait=15][red]Chu Jelly[white] concoction.


It's still piping hot! And I want you to have
this first batch, my fellow jelly connoisseur!"





"...Hrm? What's this?[wait=30]



Nooooooooooooo! Oh, what a travesty!
You don't have an [red]empty bottle[white]!
I can't give you any potion!"





"La[wait=15] di[wait=15] do![wait=15]
My next project is to create a gripping
advertisement for my new potion!
You come back any time!"





"[sound=134]Hrm...[wait=30] Hm...[wait=30] Hrrrrm???"





"...Whoa whoa WHOA![wait=20]
For a second there I thought we were all
square, but now it seems quite clear that
you [red]don't have enough[white]."





"I hate to ask you this, but can you bring
me some more? Sorry, but we geniuses are
a fickle bunch, and when we say we need
more, we need more!"





"[red]Red Potion    20 Rupees[white]
Drink it to replenish your life energy.
One drink washes away all weariness!"





"[red]Green Potion 10 Rupees[white]
This completely refills your Magic Meter!
Take a swig of it to ease your heart."





"[red]Blue Potion    60 Rupees[white]
This powerful potion replenishes both life
energy and magic power. It's an incredibly
effective dose of medicine!"





"[red]Red Potion   20 Rupees[white]
[two_choices]I'll buy it
No thanks"





"[red]Green Potion   10 Rupees[white]
[two_choices]I'll buy it
No thanks"





"[red]Blue Potion   60 Rupees[white]
[two_choices]I'll buy it
No thanks"





"Hrm?! What!? Don't tell me you don't have
an [red]empty bottle[white]! I can't sell you any potion
if you don't have something to carry it in!
It's not my law...it's the law of physics!"





"...Your bottle is full! Sir, I can't sell you
any potion if you don't have an [red]empty
bottle[white] to keep it in. Sorry, but two potions
can't occupy the same space at one time!"





"...Sir! You don't have enough [red]Rupees[white].[wait=30]
I'm sorry, but I don't just give potions
away. That's just bad business."





"La di do! Thank you muchly!"





"Hello, hello, and hello again! This is the
[red]Chu Jelly Juice Shop[white]! We use only 100%
natural [red]Chu Jelly[white] here, I assure you!"





"Farewell!"





"Zounds!! Whuh-what?!"





"You there! Halt!"





"...Oh, you're just some wretched street
urchin. I thought you were the [red]postman[white]."





"Be thankful, because if you WERE the
[red]postman[white], I would have shooed you out of
here before you could say \"boo\"!"





"But say... You look rather familiar for
a street urchin. Have we perhaps met
before someplace?"





"...What? Whatever do you mean? You
don't mean MY daughter, do you? Because
MY daughter has already been rescued
from the Forsaken Fortress.[wait=20] 
Why, she even returned with a huge load
of lovely, glittering, delicious treasure.[wait=20]
Thanks to her little incident, we've become
filthy rich overnight! And I mean FILTHY!"





"Why, there isn't a girl in the world
who's as good a child as my [red]Maggie[white]!"





"You may not have been able to help me...
but there's no harm done. I'm sure you'll
accomplish something in life...someday.

In the meanwhile, my daughter has
blossomed into quite the little beauty.
Run along! Go spend some time with her!"





"Eeeyeh heh heh heh heh!!!"





"I'm telling you for the last time, we don't
allow [red]postmen[white] here![wait=30]


...Oh! I'm sorry! My mistake!"





"Money for this! Money for that! A little
money over here! A little money over there!
Money, money, money...[wait=30]

[sound=84]Grah ha ha ha ha ha HAR!
Money makes the world go round!"





"What do you need, little urchin?"





"[draw_instant]Eh?![draw_char][wait=20]
This is one of those [red]Skull Necklaces[white] that
my daughter, [red]Maggie[white], brought back from
the Forsaken Fortress!"





"These sell quite well at antique shops...
In fact, it was thanks to these beauties that
I became so [red]filthy rich[white] overnight...[wait=30]"





"Eh? And from the looks of it, I'd say you
have about [red]twenty[white] of these, don't you?
They aren't easy to come by, either.
Frankly, I'm amazed you found so many!"





"[red]Twenty[white] of them... If you bring me [red]twenty
[white]of them I'll give you quite a gift!
...I don't suppose an urchin like yourself
could scrape up a few more for me...?"





"Eeyeh heh heh heh heh heh![wait=30]
I'll be bathing in money yet again!
The money bath! The only bath that gets
you filthy...filthy RICH!!!!"





"All right, boy... I'll give you this as a tip!
Now, I'm not thanking you or anything.[wait=15]
I'm just feeling good today!"





"I was once quite poor myself, you know.
Back then, I used to dream of owning a
boat... A boat I could use to go off in
search of treasure..."





"And now look at my filthy richness!
Chase your dreams, little urchin![wait=30]
[sound=84]Eeeyeh heh heh heh heh!"





"Oh! A [red]Skull Necklace[white]! And not just one!
You brought me [red]twenty[white] of them?![wait=30]


You're a resourceful little urchin, huh?
Well, thank you so much! Allow me to take
them off your grubby little hands!"





"Oh! Did you bring me more? It looks like
they're a bit worn... That's a good sign. It
shows personality! Antique shops love that."





"Don't worry, my little gutter urchin. I'll take
them all off your hands. I'd hate for you to
have come all this way for nothing!"





"Here's your tip: [red]20 Rupees[white]!"





"Here's your tip: [red]40 Rupees[white]!"





"Here's your tip: [red]60 Rupees[white]!"





"Eeeyeh heh heh heh heh!
Keep picking them up, little urchin![wait_dismiss=80]"





"Hmm? Are you actually bragging about
whatever that is?


Well, I suppose being poor does impair
one's judgement..."





"You're pretty bright for a grubby urchin!
Not many people your age can see the
value in these [red]Skull Necklaces[white]!

...But you know what? If this is all you've
got, it's not quite enough for me. Sorry!"

I came to deliver a letter addressed to

won't leave this island[white], so look for us
around in the shadows and behind
buildings and stuff."

You got it, bud?
Ready..."

I can't believe it. You found all four of us...

Talk about utter defeat!"

I guess maybe it's time we chilled out.
From now on, we won't cause no more

Yeahhhhhhhhhhh![wait=15] Thought so!
There ain't nothin' in this town that we

A while back, this thief stole a [red]Picto Box[white],
and he was held in the town jail for a
long, long time! Yeah, real long!"





"That thief managed to get free after a
while, but the box he stole never got found."

Maybe it's still hidden somewhere in the

forget? How many did you give me again?
[red][ms_marie_pendant_total][white]? My, but wasn't that nice!
So! What can I do for you, young man?

teacher, but I assure you I am one. How
long has it been since I opened my school
here on Windfall Island? Twenty years?
Ever since then, I've been teaching the
children of this island about true joy!"





"But I do have a rather joyless problem...
There's this delinquent gang of four young
boys who never listen to a word I say.

Even though I wait patiently for those boys
to show up, they never come. It's as if they
don't want joy in their hearts!

Could you please catch their leader, that
little boy named [red]Ivan[white], and talk some sense
into him for me?"





"Please, young man? For me?
[two_choices]Yes, ma'am
Sorry, lady"





"...Oh! That does NOT make me joyful!"





"Oh, thank you so much! You're such a dear.
They're such troublesome little boys. I'm at
my wit's end over how to handle them..."

own age, will they? I should think not."

running around in the plaza again today.
I'm counting on you to talk to them!"

You said something to those delinquents
for me, didn't you, dear?"





"You can't fool me! I watched it all from the
shadow of my door! You really are a dear!
You fill me with joy! I have to reward you...
so here's a little spare change!"





"When it comes to children, my eyes never
deceive me. Someday, dear, you will grow
up to be fine young man, and your name
will go down in history..."

Little boys shouldn't be out wandering

And let me tell you, I love jewelry more
than anything else in the world!
Hoo hoo! And why not? It's not like I can't
afford it! Why, I have so much cash, I have
my very own oasis [red]cabana[white]! But...I happen to
be after a very particular kind of jewelry."

with collecting [red]Joy Pendants[white]! Those are
very rare trinkets that you can't buy at any
store. They're quite amazing.
Why, their color...and their shape...
I feel as if I was destined to gather them!


If you have any, please show them to me.
Just set them to [y], [z], or [x]!"

Joyous Volunteer Association and the work
they do?

The association's objective is to decorate
our little town of Windfall with flowers and
other small decorative items to make our
town a better, more joyous place."





"If you must know, the society came into
being when the shop master [red]Zunari[white] arrived
here. He heard about my efforts to spread
joy, and it moved him deeply."





"He asked himself, \"Is there nothing a poor,
worthless merchant such as myself might
do to make this a better place?\" And then,
suddenly, his eyes were opened!
That's when I gave him a little advice:
\"Do something that only YOU can do!\"
...Yes, that's what I told him, dear!"

interest in volunteer activities...


He apparently came from a very cold place,

appearance, that [red]Zunari[white] is definitely one
hot volunteer!"

"\"We be tough!\" \"We be bad!\" \"We be the
toughest, baddest boys in town!\"
\"...Yeah! We're the [red]Killer Bees[white]!\"
...It went something like that.
I guess they were looking for something
of a fierce name for themselves. They sort
of failed spectacularly, if you ask me."





"It must be nice...[wait=20]to be young!"

I get it! I get it! You're incredible, dear!"

all else! And that... Why, that is extremely
rare and hard to come by. It's the hottest
thing around, dear!"

from you! No, no! I insist! Only one.


To tell you the truth, [red]I'd actually like about
20 of them[white]. But that would probably only
happen in my wildest of dreams."

And actually, tonight's [red]auction[white] is about to
begin. Oh, dear me, is it EVER!"





"Now it is, indeed, an [red]auction[white], but I like
to describe it in more simple terms: it is a
[red]competition[white] of the very highest order!

Oh yes! It is a competition to see who can
get the item that is being auctioned! Can
you outbid everyone else? Do you have the
courage and the fundage? Oh, the drama!"

I believe I do! Fortunately, we welcome
bidders of all ages! Both kids and adults!"

participate in the [red]auction[white]?

tap [a] repeatedly so you can earn [red]the right
to bid[white]. Oh, the tapping! The excitement!

Yes, yes, when you want to [red]bid[white], tap [a]![wait=30]
As you do, your gauge will gradually build
up. Once your gauge is full, your chance to
[red]bid[white] has finally come! Oh, dear me, yes!
Now, when you [red]bid[white], you're naming the price
you're willing to pay for the item.
Let us just call it your chance to show
off your wealth! Flaunt it, my dear!"





"Of course, if your fellow bidders try to
buy the item out from under you by raising
the [red]bid[white], you can always raise it in return!
Indeed, this produces much excitement![wait=30]
This dramatic back-and-forth goes on until
time runs out, at which point the person
who had the highest bid gets the sublime
honor of purchasing the item.
The auction only lasts [red]one minute[white]_not
counting the time people spend talking!
But do not worry! I will show you how much
[red]time remains[white] when you make your bid."

I still don't get it..."

rather deserted, I'm afraid to say...

due to the fact that I don't have a wide
enough lineup of products. For, if I am to
be fully honest, I only have one product."

I'm out of here!"

I knew you would understand my plight...
It is a rather long-winded explanation, but
please take the time to hear me out."





"My [red]stall[white] is a kind of [red]general store[white] that
makes its money by obtaining rare products
at inexpensive prices and then selling them.
...With a reasonable mark-up, of course.[wait=30]
However, because I have so few products to
sell, the shop remains rather...deserted."

sale! I just need to get some new products!"

and negotiate [red]supply contracts[white] with them
for me?"

contracts, but it is just a word. You do not
have to do anything very difficult.

All I need for you to do is [red]trade[white] one of my
products for a new product that the
merchant has in stock. You see, among
merchants, a [red]trade[white] is proof of a contract!
That is to say, it is the [red]merchant's oath[white]...
That is what we call it. Yes, yes."

this to another [red]traveling merchant[white] and
trade it for something...to build on
the foundation of my [red]merchant's oath[white].
As soon as you trade, the merchant you
traded with will send his products to
my shop, thereby increasing my product
line. Which will make me quite happy!

"[sound=267]Hmm... And who might you be? Why do I
get this strange feeling that we've met
before?"





"Ah... It's you...[wait=30]
The little boy who promises big promises
and then fails to deliver on them. Hmph.
Too bad you couldn't save my daughter."





"Fortunately, not everyone in this world
fails to deliver. As it turns out, my dear
[red]Mila[white] was saved by a group of kind pirates.

The pirates had a leader... [red]Tetra[white], I believe
she said her name was. I was most grateful."





"[size=75]She did demand a rather hefty reward, though...

[size=100]

Thanks to them, my fortune has vanished!
...We've hit rock bottom!"





"But...my little Mila is alive and home safe
where she belongs, so I can't complain.[wait=30]
A daughter is more important than money."





"Being poor must be pretty rough...
You take one look at me, and that's the
first thing you think, isn't it?

I ask you, why is that? Sure, the days can
get kind of tough, but good things still
happen, don't they? Money doesn't make
the sun shine, you know."





"Just recently, my missing daughter, [red]Mila[white],
was returned to me. I didn't think I
could ever feel more joyful...

But then she went and started working at
the shop to help out with our tight
family finances! What a trooper!

Could that girl be any more of an angel?"





"Although...I do worry about how she 
always seems to sneak out at [red]night[white]...


Is there any shop in this town that's
open at [red]night[white]?"





"Hmmm... The look in your eyes seems to
imply that you have something to say.
Well? What is it? Are you suggesting that
I should go to work, too?"





"Owwww![wait=20] But OH! My back has truly been
hurting me of late... Really, just ACHING...[wait=20]
If I were twenty years younger..."





"Lately, my daughter, [red]Mila[white], has been
sneaking out at night to go somewhere."





"I suppose I could tag along and secretly
follow her, but when I think about the
possibility of her doing [red]something bad[white],
I just..."





"If_and this is a huge, unlikely \"if\"_if you
happen to find [red]Mila[white] about to do some
dishonorable act, will you stop her for me?

Just do it if you catch her in the act.
Not that she ever would, but if she does,
just jump out and stop her! Please!"





"Honestly, though,[wait=30] despite how my little
[red]Mila [white]may look, she is a kind child who
thinks only of her poor father.[wait=30]
She'd never do anything bad...[wait=20]"





"My daughter and I have managed to eke
out a decent life, and in the process,
I've realized a great truth...

There is something more important than
money in the world...[wait=30]"





"I think at long last I've finally come to
understand just what [red]true happiness
[white]really is.[wait=30]

...And I'm thankful for it."





""





"Hey?[wait=15] Have we met before somewhere?[wait=15]
Aren't you...? No... Couldn't be.[wait=15]


Me? I am but a poor, [red]traveling merchant[white].
I travel the world searching for rare objects
of all sorts_modern and ancient, foreign
and exotic."





"My dream has always been to someday
open my own [red]shop[white], but plans have a way
of getting delayed, and now it's been
thirty years since I started...[wait=30]
Time certainly laughs at us all, huh?
And still, day in and day out, rain or shine,
I spend my days looking for curiosities and
rare items."





"Which reminds me, that [red]Delivery Bag[white] of
yours looks like it might have some
rare treasure in it..."





"If you happen to have something of the
quality that one could put on sale in
a [red]shop[white], would you consider trading it?"





"I have many fine products to trade.[wait=30]
If you have something you'd like to trade,
could you show it to me, please?"





"I am but a poor [red]traveling merchant[white].[wait=15]
I roam the sea collecting rare goods in the
hopes of someday opening my own shop."





"If you have anything in that [red]Delivery Bag[white] of
yours that would be perfect for selling in a
shop, could you show it to me, please?"





"How satisfactory.[wait=15]
How utterly satisfactory![wait=15]
I am through working today![wait=15]"





"Running a business is eight-tenths effort...[wait=15]
but one still shouldn't work too much.[wait=15]
...That's what my father taught me. And
that's why I trade only [red]three items per day[white]."





"Hooooo! I sure put in a lot of work today.
Satisfactory! Let's keep up that same level
of effort and dedication tomorrow!"





"Say, I heard there's another traveling
merchant not unlike myself on [red]Great Fish
Island[white] to the west of here."





"They say that for every person in the world,
there are [red]two more[white] who look exactly alike...[wait=15]
I wonder what my twins are like?"





"Ummm...[wait=15] Thanks for coming all this way
to show me what you have, but I never
trade more than [red]three items in one day[white]."





"Running a business is eight-tenths effort,[wait=15]
but overworking yourself isn't healthy.
That's what my father taught me."





"Huh? Why, that's...[wait=15]"





"Hmmm...[wait=20] You don't seem to have any items
one could easily sell at a [red]shop[white], do you?[wait=20]


I really only want to trade for the kind of
rare items that one can carry around in a
[red]Delivery Bag[white]. Everything else is just a little
too unsatisfactory for my needs."





"Ummm...[wait=20] This isn't quite the type of
thing that sells itself very well. I'm sorry."

cracked and pristine, wild and woolly!"





"I came from distant lands because I heard
there was a treasure of great worth on this
island, but I can't find a thing.

I thought perhaps my fate would cross with
that most mystic of rare items: the fabled
[red]Shop Guru Statue[white]! ...But it seems as though
I am off the mark yet again."





"By the by, for some reason, looking at that
[red]Delivery Bag[white] of yours gives me the sneaking
suspicion that it might have some rare
treasure hidden in its depths..."





"If you have anything even slightly out of
the ordinary in there, would you mind
trading it to me? Anything at all?"

full of all sorts of wondrous things! Why
don't you show me what you've got, and I'll
show you what I'll trade for it?"





"You see, there's this mystical curio that
I've been seeking for ages now...
It's called the [red]Shop Guru Statue[white].

It's said to be a statue of the most
incredible of men, a man who has long
reigned at the peak of the business world.
...But why would you have it?"





"I've heard there are traveling merchants on
the [red]Mother & Child Isles [white]and on [red]Bomb
Island[white]... I wonder if either of those guys
might have it...[wait=20]
Awwwww[wait=10]...[wait=10] If someone would just trade
that most excellent item to me, I would
offer them a [red]heart-filling reward[white] in return."





"Yes,[wait=15] yes...[wait=15]
I'm closed for the day.[wait=15]"





"Running a business is four-fifths effort,[wait=15]
but overdoing it is a bad policy.[wait=15]

That's why I trade [red]only three items per day[white]!"





"Whoa! That was a worthy day of work!"





"Ah, what kind of man is he, this so-called
[red]Shop Guru[white]?! I am so intrigued by him that I
lay awake at night just thinking about him.

If someone would just trade his idol to me,
I would give them a [red]heart-filled reward[white] in
return. Oh, would that happy event occur!"





"I hear there is a traveling merchant on the
[red]Mother & Child Isles[white] and another on [red]Bomb
Island[white]... I wonder if either of those guys
has that fabled [red]Shop Guru Statue[white]..."

to show me this, but I trade [red]only three
times per day[white]. So sorry."





"Business is four-fifths effort,[wait=15] but overdoing
it is no good for anyone.
That's what my Pops always said!"

that'll cover me.
[red][two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"Hmm... I need at least [red]100 Rupees[white] for this
one, I'm afraid.
[red][two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"It looks like the item you're offering is
kind of dirty, so how about [red]65 Rupees[white]?[red]
[two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"Your item there is in need of repair, so
how about [red]75 Rupees[white]?
[red][two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"Errr... I'll give you a huge deal:
only [red]25 Rupees!
[two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"It looks like the item you're offering is

"The colors on that thing you're offering
have faded most terribly, so [red]60 Rupees[white]![red]
[two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"It looks like the item you're offering is
kind of dirty, so how about [red]65 Rupees[white]?[red]
[two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"Mmm-hmm. This is mighty precious...
I need at least [red]100 Rupees[white] for it!
[red][two_choices][white]It's a deal
No way"





"Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no...[wait=20]
You don't seem to have enough [red]Rupees[white].[wait=20]
It looks like our contract talks have come
to a most unworthy conclusion."





"Thank you, as always!"





"Thanks![wait=20] That settles things.[wait=20]



I'll give you your item, as I promised.
Hold out both hands..."





"So, by trading your goods for my goods,[wait=20]
we've formed a [red]merchant's oath[white].[wait=20]"





"As such, from now on I shall honor our
[red]merchant's oath[white] by sending shipments of my
product to the [red]Windfall Island Shop[white].[wait=20]

How, you ask?![wait=20] Why, my good pal the
postman will take it there for me, so it will
likely get there before you do. Just head
back to Windfall and see for yourself."





"Thanks again!"





"My [red]heart-filled reward[white] has touched your
heart, hasn't it?"





"Is...
Is that...?
It couldn't be..."





"I'm what's called a [red]traveling merchant[white].
Just a poor wanderer cruising the world
in search of rare objects of all sorts_
new and old, strange and unsettling."





"I detected a scent wafting from this island
that suggested to me that there might be
something of value here, so I sailed my tiny
raft all this way from far, far away...
But the high rock wall on the main island
blocks my way, so it seems as though I
won't be able to get much farther. What a
disagreeable turn of events."





"However, my boy, that [red]Delivery Bag[white] of
yours smells to me as if it might well
be home to rare and unique items..."





"If you have any curios that might be worthy
of selling in a [red]shop[white], might you trade them
to me?"





"Someday, I'm going to open myself a shop...
a huge shop! No! A MEGA-SUPER-STORE!
I'm trying to find goods to sell, so can
you show me what you've got on you?"





"I'm what's called a [red]traveling merchant[white].[wait=15]
I scour the world for oddities and rare
items in the hopes of one day opening my
own shop. "





"If you have anything in that [red]Delivery Bag
[white]of yours that's even the slightest bit
rare or of an interesting nature, could you
let me take a look at it?"





"How agreeable.[wait=15] How truly agreeable![wait=15]
That's as much work as I'm going to do
today! I'm calling it a day![wait=15]"





"Running a business is eight-tenths effort,[wait=15]
but you don't want to work yourself into
a grave![wait=15] I trade [red]only three times a day[white]!
...That's what my dad taught me to do."





"Ahhhhh! I sure put in a lot of work today.
Quite agreeable! Let's sustain that same
level of grit and determination tomorrow!"





"Oh, hey... I hear traveling merchants have
appeared on Great Fish Isle and Bomb
Island, too..."





"If you want to know the truth, I was
amazed to hear there were other traveling
merchants in this day and age! What an
odd couple of fellows they must be!"





"Running a business is eight-tenths effort...[wait=15]
but one still shouldn't work too much.[wait=15]
...That's what my father taught me. And
that's why I trade only [red]three items per day[white]."





"A business is eight-tenths effort,[wait=15] but
working too much is bad for your health.
...That's what my dad taught me."





"Huh?
Why, that's...[wait=15]"





"Hmmm...[wait=20] You don't seem to have any items
one could easily sell at a [red]shop[white], do you?[wait=20]"





"Ummm...[wait=20] This isn't quite the type of
thing that shoppers crave. I'm sorry."





"a [red]Town Flower[white]...right?"





"a [red]Sea Flower[white]...right?"





"an [red]Exotic Flower[white]...right?"

"Why, that's a [red]Shop Guru Statue[white]...right?"





"In that case... Would you be interested in

"...Are you sure?[wait=20] Don't come crying to me if
you regret your decision later!"





"Yeah... That'll be [red]20 Rupees[white] on the dot.
[red][two_choices][white]It's a deal

"Yeah... A measly old [red]10 Rupees[white] will do.[red]
[two_choices][white]It's a deal

hot, so I'll need [red]55 Rupees[white] for mine.[red]

"Oh, alas, alas, alas, alas, alas...[wait=20]
You don't have enough [red]Rupees[white].[wait=20]
Looks like these contract talks are an
utter failure. How disagreeable."





"Thanks for your business!"





"Thanks![wait=20] That squares us.[wait=20]



Here's your item, as promised. Hold out
both of your hands..."





"So, by trading your goods for my goods,[wait=20]
you and I have formed a [red]merchant's oath[white].[wait=20]"





"So, from this moment forward I shall honor
our [red]merchant's oath[white] by sending shipments
of my product to the [red]Windfall Island Shop[white].[wait=20]"





"Thanks again!"





""





"Hmmmmmm, now...
I would have to say that I've never seen
your face before. Have I?"





"...Hmmm, now. Intriguing. Beguiling.
I know you're just a small child, but I've
found one can rarely trust strangers.
Where is it you've come from, young sir?"





"I'm sorry, but the years have made me wary.
Once, long ago, I rented a room out to a
traveler for a single night. The next dawn,
my precious [red]Picto Box[white] was stolen...
Tell me, young sir, why are good deeds so
often repaid with cruelty? I spread kindness
where I can, and still my box does not
come back to me. It is a sad thing.
You may look like a child, but you can see
why I cannot be assured of your youth.
Be a good boy, and be gone![sound=163] Shoo! Shoo!"





"Of course, I have countless [red]Picto Boxes[white],
but I do not want any of them stolen from
me. My heart could not take another loss.

[sound=163]Now, shoo! Shoo!"





"Why, young sir..."





"I must say, you seem to be in possession
of a very fine Picto Box there![wait=30]
Are you a lover of pictographs, as well?[wait=15]

There can be no villains amongst the ranks
of Picto Box-lovers! Take your time.
Look around, I implore you![red][heart]"





"Hmmmmmm now.... My, but yours is a finely
crafted [red]Picto Box[white]!"





"I once had a Picto Box of that quality...[wait=15]
I would have liked to have had the chance
to compare it to yours."





"You see, young sir, I have been studying
[red]Picto Boxes[white] since I was but a lad.


My lifelong dream of creating a box with
incredible pictography capabilities is at
long last nearing fruition."





"Young sir, I hesitate to ask, but... Could you
perchance become my [red]research assistant[white]?
[two_choices]Sure
Good-bye"





"[size=75]Hrrf! Well, I never! Kids these days!"





"Oh-ho! Really? Really and truly?!
My heart leaps at your enthusiasm, but I
feel I must tell you...the path an [red]assistant
[white]must follow is not a simple one!"





"I demand that whosoever takes on the role
of my assistant be an individual who can
take whatever command I may issue and
promptly complete it without hesitation.
It will be quite a challenge, I assure you.
Are you still sure you want to do this?
[two_choices]Absolutely
Forget it"





"Hahhh! You must share my love of the
pictograph! What is your name, young sir?

[player], is it...?[wait=15]
Very well then. I shall issue three
commands to you.[wait=15] On the dawn of the day
you complete all three tasks, you shall
be my number-one assistant, [player]!"





"Now then! For my first command..."





"A love letter.
...Do you know what that is, young sir?
It is a collection of words of love,
long unspoken and put into written form."





"Somewhere in this town, there is one who,
despite constant rejection, never learns the
cold lesson of unrequited passion and
continues to write letters of doomed love."





"I am certain the object of this sadly
one-sided affection is in quite a quandary
over the matter. I am of the mind that I
must have a word with the unwanted suitor.
However, I must have physical evidence.
And thus, your first task is to snap a
pictograph of this individual in the act
of sending the unwanted letters!"





"...That sounds easy, does it not?
Rightly so. If you hope to be my assistant,
you must perform this task with ease!"





"Somewhere in this town, there is one who,
despite constant rejection, never learns
love's cruelest lesson and continues to
write love letters without rest.
I need you to recover proof of this sad
story by [red]catching this person in the act[white]."





"Be sure to take a clear full-body shot so I
can see exactly what is going on. And, of
course, so as not to be seen, you should
[red]take the pictograph from a distance[white], yes?
Now, to prove you have completed this
task, you should set your Picto Box to
[y], [z], or [x] and press that button to show
me the pictograph. Clear, young sir?"





"Very well! Next is my second command."





"You must search for this town's most timid
and cowardly resident. I intend to flog his
spirit so as to lend him some backbone.

This individual flinches and jumps at even
the slightest of surprises. I need you to
capture the instant of pure fear on this
individual's face in a pictograph."





"So, tell me, do you think you can complete
this task, young sir?"





"You must search for the town's most timid
and cowardly resident. You must witness
this individual in a moment of weakness,
flinching in fear.
And as this poor creature cowers, you must
capture the moment in a pictograph."





"Since this person's face alone will not tell
the complete story, you must snap a head-
to-toe pictograph so I can see the [red]moment
the fear reverberates through the soul[white].
So, tell me, do you think you can complete
this more difficult second task, young sir?"





"Very good! Next is, at long last, my final
command! Open your heart and mind and
listen to what I say..."





"Somewhere in town is a couple, a man and
woman whose hearts are secretly filled with
thoughts of the other, and yet for reasons
unknown, the two have never spoken.
Even when they happen, by chance, to pass
each other in the road, they each steal a
brief, furtive glance of the other, but
they suppress the longing in their hearts..."





"I cannot let this tragedy go on any longer!
For the sake of the town and my own desire
to help these two poor souls...
I shall become [red]Cupid, archer of love[white]!
These two are timid burglars in the house
of love...and you must capture a pictograph
of them thinking their furtive thoughts!"





"And young master [player]...
If and when, hope beyond hope, you
manage to complete this third task...
Then shall you be my number-one pupil!
[sound=160]Oh ho ho ho ho! Does that not excite you?
...Good luck to you, young sir!"





"In this town is a couple whose hearts are
secretly filled with thoughts of one another,
but when they pass on the street, they only
gaze at one another and speak not..."





"You must capture in a pictograph this
secret couple, [red]at that frozen moment
when they think their furtive thoughts
of one another[white]![wait=20]
Ah, yes, yes! There is one more thing.[wait=15]
Be sure to capture them both in perfect
[red]full-body shots[white]. Their faces alone will
not tell the full story of their love."





"From here onward, come rain or wind,
my heart shall rest in comfortable ease.[wait=15]
And at the same time, your heart will
learn the love that pictography fosters!
[sound=160]Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!"





"My assistant, [player]! Allow me a
brief query. Do you perchance know about
[red]pictographs with color[white]?

I have researched this concept for many
years, and at long last I understand it!
A stronger light is needed to imbue color
in the pictograph. No normal light will do.
In fact, normal light must be overcome!
Color pictography requires a light of the
very brightest intensity!"





"Now, I have heard tales of a mystical
creature in a place called the [red]Forest Haven[white].
It is said to be the tiniest of creatures,
one that unleashes an otherworldly light...
As an aid to me and my research, could
you possibly use an [red]empty bottle [white]to capture
one of these creatures of legend?"





"Ah, young [player]... Are pictographs
not the most divine of creations? You know
it is true, my young sir!"





"You, too, must snap and snap and snap
pictographs until you, like me, finally arrive
at the very pinnacle of pictography!"





"Hmmm, now? Are you offering me this
thing? Sadly, I have no need of it."





"What's this, now?"





"Is... Is that...?"





"...Why, I feared the secret light had been
extinguished forever! Is that truly one of
the long-fabled [red]Forest Fireflies[white]?!
Oh, glory!"





"My fine assistant, [player]...
For ages, it has been said that the
[red]Forest Fireflies[white] possess a mystical power.

For your efforts, I shall place this one
inside your box! Come on now, hand me
your [red]Picto Box[white], if only for a moment..."





"Oh-ho! Now, those pictographs of yours
that have forever lacked the scintillating
palette of life should henceforth show the
world as it was meant to be_in living color!
[size=75]Hmm, now... That was quite an easy thing to do after all!

[size=100]

...Ah, well. Such is life. Now go out there
and snap pictographs. Snap them in color
for me, for all the years I spent unable to
do so! Go to it, [player]!"





"I am a bit of a purist when it comes to
pictographs. I'm sorry, but skill such as
yours would require much polish before I'd
consider you for the position of assistant."





"[size=75]Hmm... That's not quite right.[size=100]
I'm terribly sorry, but there is no way
I could possibly give this a passing grade.
I'm afraid you must retake the shot!
When you snap a pictograph, you must be
sure not to snap it too close-up, and yet,
at the same time it should not be too
zoomed-out...
All of which means you must begin your
study of the pictography basics anew."





"Oh-ho! Now THIS is a finely snapped
pictograph indeed! Hmmm now...
They say love is blind, but what could he
be thinking, mailing all these letters?
I should not ridicule him, though, for he
reminds me of myself back in the innocence
of my youth... Memories of those bittersweet
summer days come rushing back to me..."





"But I digress...
Very good, young sir! I must congratulate
you on...passing your first test!"





"I shall promptly take this pictograph from
you and use it most efficiently!"





"Oh-ho! Now THIS is a finely snapped
pictograph indeed! Clearly this individual
must be the town's most timid of denizens!
Fear is his constant companion!
I cannot complain, young sir! You have
passed in a most admirable manner!
...Say, and is it me, or is this chap quite
the striking individual?"





"Very good, young sir! And this means you
have passed my second test!"





"To take the finest of pictures, you must
spend your days devoted to the path of
pictography, [player]! My young sir...
...My[wait=10] assistant!"





"Oh-ho! This is a finely snapped pictograph
indeed! ...I had no idea these two would
get along so splendidly! You can see the
love there, hidden but thriving.
Even I, who have lived in this town for so
many long years, did not realize in the
slightest the extent of their passion.
You have done well, [player]."





"Now then, my young sir... You have
completed all of the tasks I set you to.


My doubts about you have all been cleared
up! I shall hereby be proud to call you my
assistant, [player]!

And to reward you further for your fine
efforts, I offer you this! The elderly lady
next door tells me it has value, of sorts."





"From here onward, come rain or wind,
my heart shall rest in comfortable ease.[wait=15]
And at the same time, your heart will
learn the love that pictography fosters!
[sound=160]Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!"





"Ahh, pictographs."





"[sound=160]Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
Aren't these some finely snapped
pictographs? You must admit it!"





"...But come now! You needn't be so
surprised, my young sir!


It is a hobby of mine to sneak up behind
people when they least expect it. It's quite
an amusing diversion. Think nothing of it."





"By the way, the pictographs you see
decorating these fine walls have all been
taken by none other than myself.
They are my pride and joy!"





"You see, in my younger days I was tireless,
sailing far and wide across the Great Sea,
snapping pictographs wherever I went..."





"Have a look at them, young sir!"





"What is this a pictograph of, you ask?"





"Well, those are creatures called [red]ChuChus[white].
They are said to have medicinal properties,
so they are a most important resource
treasured by sailors the world over."





"Why, there is even said to be an extremely
rare species of them known as the [red]Blue
ChuChu[white]. It is only under very unusual
circumstances that they are ever sighted.
...You would be most lucky to ever
come across one, young sir!"





"This is a pretty nice pictograph."





"This one is of a tiny rock islet resting
far out in the seas southeast of here.
Isn't it nice?"





"There was a very dignified [red]butler[white] standing
before the door, and I snapped his photo
without even thinking... That aside, I am
certain this is someone's private [red]cabana[white]."





"This is an incredible pictograph."





"I saw this strange platform rising up out of
the seas, seeming to claw at the sky.
...It makes for an even stranger silhouette."





"I wonder if such things still remain out
there on the high seas, lonely on the waves.
Ah, if I only had the chance, I would love
to see these things once again..."





"This is a pictograph of a place I
once visited."





"Isn't it a finely snapped shot? I took it
in my younger days. It is [red]Outset Island[white]."





"It is the most delightful of fishing villages,
innocent and rich with nature's bounty...
It was there I met a beautiful young lass...

Although I suppose she is probably not
as young as she used to be these days..."





"What kind of pictograph is this, you ask?"





"One ill-fated day, misfortune befell me and
my boat was destroyed. Clinging to the
wreckage, I drifted at the whims of the
waves... That's when I saw this monstrosity.
This foul ship, veiled in mist and fading
in and out of sight like something of
another world... Yes, my young sir...
'Tis none other than the [red]Ghost Ship[white]!"





"The rumors I've heard tell of a man who
researched the reaches of the sea where
the [red]Ghost Ship[white] faded in and out of sight,
and that he drew a map of its movements.
But it is said that as soon as the man had
finished drawing the lines of that cursed
map...he died a most unexpected death.
...Chilling! Truly chilling!
Now, if one were able to find that map...
then it might be possible to sneak onto
the [red]Ghost Ship[white] and get the treasure that
is said to lurk within its hull!"





"This pictograph chills me to the bone..."





"The [red]Forsaken Fortress[white]!



This place lies to the northwest of our fair
isle, but it has been enveloped in filthy
dark clouds of late. What are we to do
against the silent evil that lingers there?"





"If you value your life, young sir, then at
the very least you should stay as far away
from that place as you possibly can.

...It feels as if evil that is not of this world
lies in wait there, biding its time."





"Not a bad pictograph, hm?"





"Is that not a rather mysterious statue?
The statue's home is on one of the [red]Triangle
Islands[white]. It lies due south of here."





"There are a total of three [red]Triangle Islands[white]:
the [red]Northern[white], the [red]Southern[white], and the [red]Eastern
Triangle Islands[white]... Each of them has a
statue such as this standing on its shores."





"Does this not make a fine pictograph?



It is the epitome of pictography: not too
close-up, yet not too zoomed-out to discern
the subject. It boasts perfect balance of
scale, wouldn't you say?"





"What's the secret to snapping a fine
pictograph, you ask?


Why, it is to stand back at a slight
distance and to capture your subject
framed in just the right manner.

If the Picto Box is too zoomed-in, you
cannot discern what the subject is, correct?
That is why such pictographs are rarely
considered to be fine snapshots."





"Ah, the conditions for a fine pictograph,
you ask? Well now...


Generally, you should capture your subject
from the top of his or her head to the tips
of his or her toes. Your subject should be
framed fully within the pictograph's border.
Essentially, you should just concentrate on
getting your subject as large as possible
within the frame of the pictograph."





"And with that..."





"Quickly now! Up above!"





"Greetings, O person who has surely come to
take the challenge of the big sky! This is
where you can register for the Official Rito
Tribe [red]Bird-Man Contest[white]!"





"And now, listen. You are free to use any
means, methods or tools you have at your
disposal to help you soar through the sky.

The rules are simple: \"See how far you can
fly before you crash into the roiling seas
like so much dead-weight driftwood!\""





"A banner stands now at the site where the
[red]Great and Talented Champion[white], who has
flown the farthest to date, crashed into the
frothy waves in a massive splash of glory!
If you are able to pass that flag...[wait=20]
then YOU will be the new [red]champion[white]!
And you will be drenched in praise, much
as you will be drenched in sea water!"





"The participation fee is a mere [red]10 Rupees[white]!
Well? Will you take the challenge?
[two_choices]I will
Not right now"





"Ahh, do you not feel the grand romance of
the wide open skies? The roaring invitation
of the wind? The soft call of the clouds?
You are a boring, boring creature."





"Ru... Ru... Rupees! You do not have
enough Rupees, my empty-pocketed friend!"





"Ohhhhh-kayyy! Then up the ladder you go!
My brother awaits you up top!"





"Uh, you don't seem to have any wings or
feathers or anything on your back...


So...you do have something that you can
use to fly, right? I sure hope so.
Here's wishing the wind beneath your,
uh...thing! Whatever it is!"





"Do you want to fly again, young fledgling?
The entrance fee is only [red]10 Rupees[white]!
[two_choices]I'll fly
Not right now"





"Your current record is [red][flight_platform_record][white].
May you return as feathered and winged as
a bird of the skies!"





"Come back any time you have...time!"





"...Uh, what was that?! That was so terrible,
I don't even know where to begin offering
advice! I could have fallen unconscious and
done better than that!"





"Hmm... [red][flight_platform_time][white]?
That's...not impressive.


At the very least you ought to be paying
attention to the direction of the wind
when you fly. Think!"





"[red][flight_platform_time][white]? I suppose that's about average.
By which I mean, not even remotely in the
league of the great and talented.

Say, have you ever thought of flying into
any of the updrafts you see out there?
They can really boost your distance."





"[red][flight_platform_time][white]?
Well, you have some skill_that much is for
certain. But let me teach you the secrets
to pushing your distance further.
First of all, the wind has to be blowing
directly toward your goal. That's the only
time you should be flying. Secondly, use the
updrafts, and use them well.
Keep these two techniques in your head
when you fly... Just don't tell my brother
upstairs! Trade secrets, you know!"





"[red][flight_platform_time][white]!?! Really???
Wow! That's some great flying...but not
quite great AND talented!

I have no more advice to share with you.
All that's left is to cast your luck to
the wind and just fly! Fly, boy, fly!"





"Flight distance was:[wait=5]
[sound=240][red][flight_platform_time][white]![wait=10]


Yes! A whopping [red][flight_platform_time][white]![wait=10]"





"Amazing... You blew past [red]my brother's
best record[white] in impressive fashion!"





"You would make a fine and distinguished
member of the [red]Rito Tribe[white]! I guarantee it!
The [red]former champion[white] upstairs says so, too!
You are both great and talented!"





"So, as the new champion of the [red]Bird-Man
Contest[white], please accept this great and
talented prize!"





"Come back anytime you feel the desire
to fly again! I shall await with one eye
on the sky and the other on the sea!"





"We should have expected as much, 
O champion! Another stupendous flight!"





"This is just a trifling thing, but please
accept it!
"





"Your current record is your superb flight of
[red][flight_platform_record][white]! All hail!"





"O Great and Talented Champion!
You've come again! Would you like to fly?
[two_choices]I'll fly
Not right now"





"Oh, how lamentable!
..Where was your skill, O champion!?"





"Oh! A challenger! The contest is afoot!



You see that banner far off in the distance?
That marks the record distance set by our
[red]Great and Talented Champion[white]!
...You must pass that banner!"





"You can use whatever means, methods and
tools you have at your disposal! All you
must do is take to the skies and aim for
that flag, plain and simple!
Just imagine you are flying down from the
very summit of Dragon Roost Mountain!"





"Have you finished all your stretching
exercises? Is the wind blowing the way
you like? Is your ballast balanced?"





"Once you have performed all your preflight
checks, step onto that launch pad and take
flight like an elegant creature of the air!

The banner you see out yonder marks the
record set by our [red]Great and Talented
Champion[white]! ...You must pass it!"





"Your current record is [red][flight_platform_record][white]!"





"Oh! You are the [red]New and Great and
Talented Champion[white] who surpassed even me!


Please show us humble brothers yet another
great flight! I tremble with anticipation!"





"Have you seen the small metal pedestals all
around town? We call those [red]Joy Pedestals[white]."





"Yeah, they got installed a little while ago
by the newly formed [red]Joyous Volunteer
Association[white]. It's part of this grand plan to
help decorate the town."





"Anyway, they're brilliant! I may as well tell
you that both myself and [red]Zunari[white], the guy
who runs that stall over there, are members.
You just have to be a part of stuff like this!"





"Hey there, little joy junior! Thanks so much
for being a [red]Joyous Volunteer[white]!"





"Wow! Windfall just seems to be filled with
joy lately... Don't you think?"





"Say, you haven't been cooperating with the
volunteers, have you? You know what I'm
talking about? Decorating the town?"





"Oh, really? ...You have? Wow, it never fails
to amaze me how kind and thoughtful folks
can be. ...I know! I'll return your kindness
with some of my own!"





"I hope you'll continue to help the
[red]Joyous Volunteer Association[white] with its work,
little joy junior!"





"Now I get it... You're secretly assisting the
[red]Joyous Volunteer Association[white], aren't you?"





"Yeah, I've been a member for a while now,
so I can just tell these things. And being
a member is so rewarding! Spreading joy is
something you just HAVE to experience!"





"The [red]Joy Pedestals[white] are set out so that
people can place little joyful objects in
them and decorate the town."





"The items you can place in them should be
on sale over there, so try asking [red]Zunari
[white]about the whole deal. Honestly, you're
missing out if you don't take part!"





"Whoa! Don't startle me like that!
...Sheesh! I thought we were having an
earthquake or something!"





"Both [red]Mila[white] and [red]Maggie[white] returned unharmed!



It sounds as though they went through
quite an ordeal, but they're safe now."





"Oh, the horribleness! I don't know what I'd
do if I were kidnapped and taken to the
Forsaken Fortress! Just the thought of it
sends shivers down my spine! Brrrr!"





"Lately, I've been hearing that monsters from
the [red]Forsaken Fortress[white] have been going
around kidnapping girls with long ears."





"I can believe it. After all, two girls from
Windfall have already been kidnapped. Poor
[red]Maggie[white] and [red]Mila[white]... It just breaks my heart
to think about those two."





"Both of their fathers are desperate to find
anyone who can rescue their poor little
girls... What kind of world has this
become?! So much fear and suffering..."





"[cyan]Tee hee hee!
Tell me, little boy...
[wait=20]Can you control the wind?"





"[cyan]Hee hee! So young, to have such power...[white]
[cyan]How did you know to find me here?"





"[cyan]I am the queen of the fairy world!



What is the matter, my child?
Does that not surprise you?[wait=10] Young one..."





"[cyan]I like you.



And so, I shall give new power to the
[red]bow[cyan] that you wield."





"[red]Ice Arrows[cyan] can freeze the hottest flames,
and [red]Fire Arrows[cyan] can melt the coldest ice."





"[cyan]The fairies in this fountain will ease your
weariness.[wait=20] Use them as you need to."





"[cyan]Child...



I must tell you... You are just my type.
Tee hee hee!"





"[cyan]Young waker of the winds..."





"[cyan]Allow me to aid you in your quest."





"[cyan]The fairies in this fountain shall ease your
weariness. When you grow fatigued from
your battles, come here to be refreshed."





"[cyan]Oh, waker of the winds..."





"[cyan]Thanks to you, I have been freed from
that beast's foul grasp..."





"[cyan]As thanks, I shall give you just a little
of my power..."





"[cyan]May the winds of fortune always blow
across your bow..."





"[cyan]In the [red]place where the wind god guides
you[cyan], you will find one who can grant new
power to the [red]Hero's Bow[cyan] that you wield."





"[cyan]...Power that can freeze fierce flames and
melt the coldest ice."





"[cyan]When you find you have need of such
power, you must call upon the powers of
the wind god."





"Oh! A fine welcome to you, young person
that I've never seen before!


You're so lucky to meet me at this time!
This shop will close in just [red]seven more
days[white], and I'm having a clearance sale."





"I'm going to be closing very soon, so if you
want to buy something, you'd better buy it
now. That's what I'd recommend."





"Use [control_stick_right][right_arrow] to browse, huh?"





"Why are you looking at me, huh?
Look at the goods!"





"Come again!"

"[red]Treasure Chart  Current Price
[white]The price may be high, but it'll pay
off handsomely in the end!"





"This [red]Empty Bottle[white] is a mere [red]500 Rupees[white]!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy buy buy!
[two_choices]I'll buy it
No thanks"

"OHHHHH! You don't have enough Rupees!
Come on! Get it together!"





"You can't carry anything more!"





"Oh! You don't have an empty bottle!
I'm only selling the contents! Sorry!"





"OHHHHH! Thank you so much!
You're happy, I'm happy...
We're all happy!"





"I didn't lie! I closed...and completely redid
the inside of my shop. Tah-dah! It's reborn!"





"What? I have nothing to talk about...
Just buy something, huh?"





"What's that? Why would I know what that
is? I'm not Beedle! Or whatever his name is!
Don't show me that!"





"If you have time to show me that, then
you're not doing what you should be!
Stop fooling around!"





"OHHHHH! I'm sad to say that this shop will
close in just six short days.


Right now, I'm having my clearance sale.
Great deals to be had!"





"OHHHHH! I regret to inform you that this

a bit and then come on back, huh?"





"Sorry about that!"





"OHHHHH! Hey! I've been waiting for you!



These scurvy pirates sold me some [red]bombs
[white]for cheap! This may be your only chance!
Buy buy buy!"





"By the way, are you friends with that
adorable little kid?"





"Ohhh, you're pretty smart for someone with
such a young face, huh?
[sound=125][wait=10]Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!"





"Buy something, you little imp!"





"Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!"





"We close tomorrow! If you're going to
buy, you'd better buy now!"





"We close today! Which means this is the

means that you'd better buy buy BUY!"





"I don't have anything for sale at the
moment, but I'm constantly looking for
things that I can sell at good prices JUST
to you. I'm serious! I'm not lying!"





"Have I ever tricked you before?
[two_choices]Yes
No"





"Of course not! So believe me! Just wait a
little longer, huh?"





"I'm sorry, I wasn't listening just now..."





"What? I couldn't hear you."





"I'm sorry, I don't understand the words
that you use. What language is that?"





"OHHHHH! You're absolutely right! I've never
fooled you! Not even one time! Not once!
Thank you so much for believing me!"

"Hmmm... Well, that's not quite enough...
I know! If you could collect [red]20[white] of them for
me, I'll give you something quite splendid.

Yes! That's your homework for today, dear!
Collect [red]20[white] of them!"





"It's just not in my nature to do such
scrounging for jewelry... But you can do it,
can't you? Please wrap me in the pure joy
of [red]20[white] of those delightful things!"





"Why, to think a child like you would pay
such a large tribute to me...


Oh, your teacher is very impressed by
your efforts, little dear! My whole body
is numb with the thrill of excitement!
...So this is what pure joy feels like!"





"I'll take precisely [red]20[white] of them, thank you.
That will do just fine! My heart will be
all aflutter! I don't know if you know,
but [red]20[white] is my [red]lucky number[white]!"





"And just as I promised, I will reward you
for going out and collecting all these for
me. I'm going to give you...

A wonderfully splendid[red] thing[white]!
Close your eyes, dear..."





"Dum-dah-DUM!



You see, although I am but a mere teacher, I
own my very own [red]cabana[white] in a tropical
oasis down south. But lately I haven't
made use of it at all, so you can have it!
[sound=159]Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo! It's all right, dear.
You can stop gaping in amazement now!"





"Now that you have this deed, that [red]cabana
[white]is all yours! You OWN it! So whatever
you do, don't lose this piece of paper!"





"I am getting on in age, and sea travel
hasn't exactly agreed with me as of late...
Now I can just stay here and relax as I
continue my work with the children."





"And just so you know, you'll find the place
[red]southeast[white] of here! It's on a tiny, lonely little
isle near the Triangle Islands.

From now on, it is your own little
[red]bachelor pad[white]! Good luck finding it!"





"Oh, and one more thing...
Don't tell ANYBODY, dear!"





"My dear! Did you bring me [red]Joy Pendants
[white]yet again?"





"Hmm... Are you giving these to me as well?
But I told you I was perfectly satisfied
with the [red]20[white] you gave me before!"





"But my, you are such a persistent little
dear! Since you are so insistent, I will
accept them happily!  ...Fine! I have no
choice but to unleash pure joy on you!
Prepare for an onrush of joy the likes
of which you've never imagined!"

...And speakin of, bud, did you know it's
gonna be [red]Mrs. Marie's[white] birthday soon?"





"Boss! Ooh! Boss!
You think maybe we should we give her
some kinda present or something?"





"Don't be stupid! We're the [red]Killer Bees[white]!
We ain't no teacher's pets!"





"Yeah, but Teach' loves jewelry and junk
more than anythin' else in the world!


What's she into these days?
What'd she call 'em? [red]Joy Pendants[white]?"





"Really? Where do you find 'em? Are they
just lyin' around? If we could just find
some, we could give 'em to Teach' as a
present, and she'd be all happy..."





"Hey... Now that I think about it, when I was
climbin' trees the other day, I saw some
[red]sparkly light up on top of some tree[white]
in town. Where was that...?"





"Maybe that's one of them pendants!
What d'ya think, Boss...?
Nah! That's crazy-talk!"





""





"Yo, bud! Looks like you found yourself
a [red]Joy Pendant[white]! Solid work!"





"Actually, I gotta admit, we hid that thing
up in the tree. We thought you might find it!"





"Listen up! It's gonna be [red]Mrs. Marie's
[white]birthday soon. We were thinkin' of givin'
her a present, so it was good that we
finally got our hands on that thing..."





"...But we can't be goin' around givin'
presents to people! No way! That just
don't fit the Killer Bees' style!"





"Come on, bud! Can't you give it to Teach'
for us? Can't you?"





"And it's not like we could ask just anybody
to do it for us, neither. It's gotta be
someone reliable, who can keep a secret...
You're the only one we could ask, bud!"





""





"You listen, young man! I haven't seen you
around, so I guess you're new to Windfall...
but don't you know it's bad to eavesdrop on
conversations meant only for adult ears?"





"We're discussing...very, VERY important
topics that kids just wouldn't understand.
You're far too young to be listening to us,
young man! So shoo!"





"So anyway, you know that brick building at
the top of the steps? Well, the gentleman
who lives there has SUCH class!"





"Ooh, I KNOW! That mysterious pictographer,
[red]Lenzo[white] is so...dreamy! Ohhhhhhhh...
He makes my heart go aflutter!"





"But...do you think the rumors could be true?
Is he actually devoted to someone special?
He just seems too serious about his work to
be involved with somebody..."





"The lucky lady! Who could she be?! I wish
someone would take a pictograph of the
two of them together so we could see if the
rumors are true! Oh, that'd be to die for!"





"Well, I suppose we were all wrong about
the rumors of [red]Lenzo[white] and his \"girlfriend\"..."





"Ahhh... I simply can NOT wait!
Tonight's auction is going to be so fun!"





"Oooh! Oooh! The excitement! The drama!
Just wondering who's going to win the
bidding race tonight gives me goosebumps!
...I'm not sure I can wait until dark!"





"I'm going to be the auction star tonight,
I just know it!"





"They call those pictographs. I know all
about those things. ...That one's pretty nice."





"Oh, you mean [red]Lenzo[white] and the lady who loves
pictographs? Yes, yes, I already know
about that."





"OH! 
[size=75]This is..."





"It's the pictographer, [red]Lenzo[white], and that
pictograph-loving lady!"





"I guess we were completely wrong about
Lenzo having a girlfriend...


It looks as though they're just old friends
who happen to share the same hobby."





"Thanks for setting us straight, young man.
We really should stop spreading idle
gossip like that.[wait=20]

...You've taught us the error of our ways,
and to thank you, we're going to give you
something nice. Stick out your hand!"





"My naughty little boy found this
somewhere. I'm sure you'll like it!"





""





"You look like a curious boy... Did you know
there's an island a little to the east of
here called [red]Dragon Roost Island[white]?"





"Folks say that the island is the home of a
tribe of people who dance in the skies like
birds on the wind. They call themselves the
[red]Rito[white], and they say a [red]sky spirit[white] lives nearby."





"But...to someone like me, a person who's
never left this little island, it may as well
be a fairy tale out of a child's book.
...Oh, if only I had my own boat!"





"[red]Dragon Roost Island[white]...
I'd surely love to go there some day. They
say it's only a little ways to the east..."





"The sky-dancing [red]Rito tribe[white]... A mystical
[red]sky spirit[white]... Dragon Roost Island just
sounds like a paradise floating in the
ocean of my dreams!"





"Is... Is... Is that...your boat?
Well, that's startling!"





"Umm, if I may suggest something, I'd prefer
you to take my pictograph from the front...


I'll certainly have no complaints if you take
a perfect shot of me from my face down to,
oh, say...my hips! Yes, that would do nicely!"





"Well, that's an excellent pictograph of me!
...I'm amazed! Usually, I look awful on film!


Oh, but...somehow my complexion just
doesn't look right. Maybe that's because
it's a black and white pictograph..."





"Oh, yes! Look at my face!
...How charming!"





"Well, is this how I look today?
...Why, I had no idea that the gloss on my
skin was so...perfect!"





"Just LOOK at me! I am so stunning!
...Oh, I feel so wonderful now!


I have to reward you for making me
feel so good about myself! Here!"





"My son picked it up somewhere, and I
would imagine you like this sort of thing,
correct? My son likes it, so you must, too!"





"If you could indulge me for a moment,
please admit that I am looking FINE!
Why, looking this fine would have won me
the Miss Windfall crown way back when!
I'm STILL looking better than all the
younger girls I know! Hoo hoo hoo!"





"Oh, hoo hoo hoo! And how do I look today?"





"My skin will always be beautiful!



Hoo hoo hoo! Not even the younger girls
look prettier than me!"





"You know, HE always shows off his pictures
of me just as soon as he's taken them."





"...What?! I'll have you know I've only come
here to have him take a pictograph of my
exceptionally beautiful skin!"





"I've been a huge fan of pictographs for a
long time now...


So don't go taking this the wrong way! "





""





"Allow me to think... Ah. Yes. I first started
searching for pictographs that recorded
true beauty...oh, about ten years ago..."





"How interesting!"





"Hah?[wait=15]
...Who's there?[wait=15]"





"Wh-Wh-Wh[wait=15]-What are you doing here?[wait=15]
Were you trying to give me a heart attack?"





"Hmm... And now that I think on it, just how
did you get in here? Why, I never even
noticed you!"





"Well, if that isn't a [red]Joy Pendant[white]! Wait...
Are you trying to say that I look even
more fabulous when I wear jewelry?

Why, you delightful little rascal!
Tee hee!"





"You learned the [red]Command Melody[white]!"





"You learned the [red]Earth God's Lyric[white]!"





"[draw_instant]You got the [red]Hero's Clothes[white]![draw_char]
[wait=10]They look like they might be a little
warm for this weather..."





"Hey there, boy! Did you happen to see the
postbox down near the docks?"





"Well, just so you know, if you want to send
someone a letter, just set it to [y], [z], or [x],
and use that button to put it in the
[red]postbox[white]. It's just that easy."





"Before long, the [red]Rito postman[white] will come to
deliver it to whomever you've sent it to.
He's a hardworking fellow, I tell you!"





"I wonder if the [red]Rito[white] [red]postman[white] has already
come today..."





"Let's see... Was that all I needed to send?
I didn't forget anything, did I?"





"Dang! I DID forget to send something!
What a drag..."





"Awwww... What are you doing, taking
pictures like this?


I'd only send something like this to my
future wife!"





"I don't feel guilty at all!"





"Oh! A pictograph!



You know, there's a famed pictographer
living in the red brick building in town.
Have you been to see him yet?"





"Welcome!"





"Oh, my! You're a very small customer,
aren't you? Well, that's fine, of course.
You just feel free to look around!"





"Oh, can I help you with something?
[two_choices]Let's talk
Maybe next time"





"Well, 'bye!"





"You know, the world's a crazy place, kiddo.
You're still young, so you probably don't
know about what goes on out there beyond
the comfortable confines of your home."





"Listen to this... The other night, a gang
of gangly pirates came into my shop
without any warning, and do you want to
know what they did?
Well, I'll tell you! They said, \"Hey! You!
You'll be renting your little place out to us
tonight! You got that?!\" I had no choice!"





"And that night, they stayed up all night
drinking coffee, singing strange pirate
songs of \"love and loss\" (whatever THAT
means), and generally causing a ruckus!
...Now THEY were a troublesome bunch!"





"If I look a little worried, it's just because
my pop's been sick and bedridden for a
long time now."





"That's why I'm stuck managing this cafe!"





"It's taken me a while, but I think I'm finally
getting the hang of running this place."





"When night falls around here, this place
fills up with all these sour, swarthy sailors."





"In fact, there's this little boat called the
[red]Shop Ship[white] that shows up at night and
cruises around the island selling things.
I'm not sure what the story is with that.
I guess what I'm trying to tell you here is
that this town has two faces: the nice,
pretty one you see in the [red]day[white] and the
darker, shadier one you see at [red]night[white].
...But I suppose that's too heavy a concept
for a youngster like yourself, eh?"





"Shhh! Keep quiet! ...This is no time for a kid
like you to be coming in here!"





"You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Just be a good kid and go home, OK?"





"Just a second, there, kid! ...Look, this isn't
any time for a kid like you to be coming
in here! Just trust me, OK?"





"Go on, now! Go home!"





"Fine night, isn't it?"





"You know, this thing may look like a
windmill, but it's actually a [red]wind-powered
ferris wheel[white]! It used to harness the wind's
power to spin in quite a nifty manner...
But we rarely get a favorable wind around
here anymore, so it doesn't budge."





"I'm pretty sure it's not broken or anything,
though, so if the [red]wind [white]blew [red]in the right
direction again[white], we'd just have to hit the
[red]power switch[white] out back to get it moving."





"Whoa! That's a pretty incredible wind
we've got blowing right now![wait=20]


But...the funny thing about this [red]ferris wheel
[white]is the fact that it doesn't matter how strong
the breeze is_it still won't budge unless
someone presses the power switch!
I don't know why they didn't just make it
work like a regular old windmill.
That would have been way better!"





"Hmmm... It looks like a southeasterly wind
is blowing right now."





"Hmm... It looks like a southwesterly wind
is blowing now."





"Hmm... It looks like an easterly wind is
blowing now."





"Hmmm... It looks like a westerly wind is
blowing now."





"Ummm... It looks like a northerly wind is
blowing now."





"Hmm... It looks like a northeasterly wind
is blowing now."





"Umm... It looks like a northwesterly wind is
blowing now."





"Do you see that, little man? The light in
the lighthouse has been reignited! Check
out the beam of light that sweeps out now,
shining through the night's darkness!"





"Seeing that brave beam fighting the gloom
has made me so happy, I just feel like
giving somebody a present. So, here! I'm
giving this to you, little man!"





"Now Windfall is going to be even more
lively than before! Hurray for everything!"





"Well, would you look at that! The ferris
wheel just started moving all on its own!
Somebody must have started it up.

I wonder who got the thing going again?
I don't know who it was or where he is, but
he must be one nice guy_assuming, of
course, that he IS a guy."





"Well, seeing as how it's finally moving
again, you should go for a ride while you
have the chance.

You can jump into the [red]gondola seats [white]just
around the corner from here! Trust me,
little man, it's fun."





"This tower was originally used as a
lighthouse for Windfall Island, you know.


Yeah, it used to send a bright shaft of light
onto the night sea_sort of a safety beacon.
...But that was quite some time ago."





"Even now, what's left of that lighthouse's
illumination device still spins around up
top, all night, every night.
...But its fire remains extinguished."





"Isn't that a sad story? And it doesn't have
to be. I bet that thing would light up again
if someone could just get a spark of fire
inside it."





"Looking out from the top of a lighthouse
is the best! Don't you agree, little man?"





"[player]...[wait=60] [player]...
[wait=60]Wake up, [player]!"





"Pull yourself together, [player]!"





"Well? Have you come to your senses yet?[wait_dismiss=80]"





"You are surprisingly dull-witted..."





"[wait=30]Did I startle you?



I suppose that is only natural. As wide
as the world is, I am the only boat upon
it who can speak the words of men.

I am the [red]King of Red Lions[white].
Do not fear... I am not your enemy."





"[player]...



I have been watching you since you went to
the Forsaken Fortress to rescue your sister.


I understand how your desire to protect
your sister could give you the courage to
fearlessly stand up to anything...

But such a bold attempt was foolhardy!



I suppose you saw him... The shadow that
commands that monstrous bird..."





"His name is...[wait=60][draw_instant]Ganon[draw_char]..."





"...He who obtained the power of the gods,
attempted to cover the land in darkness,
and was ultimately sealed away by the
very power he hoped to command."





"He is the very same Ganon...
The emperor of the dark realm the ancient
legends speak of..."





"I do not know why the seal of the gods has
failed, but now that Ganon has
returned, the world is once again being
threatened by his [red]evil magic[white]."





"Tell me, [player]...
Do you still wish to save your sister
from him?"





"And will you do anything to save her?"





"...I see.



In that case, I shall guide you as we go
forward...advising you on what you should
do, and where you must go.

Ganon cannot be defeated by human
hands, let alone by what little strength
you possess."





"The key to defeating Ganon is locked
away in a great power that you can wield
only after much toil and hardship.

Do you understand?"





"In that case, we depart!
To the Great Sea!
[wait=30]...Ah, but I am getting ahead of myself."





"This is actually a bit embarrassing for me
to admit, but...although I am indeed a boat
that possesses the power of speech...
I possess no [red]sail[white].
And a boat with no [red]sail [white]can sail no seas."





"I have brought you far to the east of the
dark gaze of the Forsaken Fortress. On this
island is a town of merchants who deal in
a wide variety of goods.
If you search hard enough, surely you can
find one who will sell you a [red]sail[white].


I am sorry to ask this of you, but without
a [red]sail[white], I will be useless to you."





""





""





"This island of merchants is home to many
valuable goods.


While the sail must come first, do not feel
limited to buying only it. Once you have it,
feel free to stock up on anything else you
think you may need.
But remember: there is no time to play.
Come back here immediately as soon as
your errands are done."





"It is just as the postman told us.
The pirate ship has stopped here to avoid
drawing the attention of the townsfolk..."





"I know not what they are researching, but
if they are hoping to get their hands on
Jabun's sacred gem...

I doubt they would tell you anything
directly if you were to ask them.


[player], I think you should try to
find out what the pirates are up to...
without them finding out about you."





"What is the matter? Go see what the
pirates are doing, and come back as
quickly as you can."





""





"What is the matter, [player]?



...Have you forgotten the password?



It's simple. It's [red][pirate_password][white]!



And remember, once you hear a password...
do your best not to forget it."





"Well done! Our preparations are complete.



If what the girl says is true, the pirates
won't be leaving until morning.


You must meet with Jabun and get the [red]pearl
[white]from him before they arrive.


Let us delay no longer, [player]!"





"There is no one playing music nearby."





"Medli, listen carefully to what I am about
to tell you."





"The temple ahead is the nest of an evil
creature...the same creature that stole the
life of your predecessor, the sage.
It is a dark and frightening place.
That is why, if you do nothing else,
then at least do this..."





"If [player] comes near you and
presses [r] to call you, then be silent,
and follow closely behind him."





"And if [player] presses [a], allow
him to lift you, and if need be, fly and
carry him through the air."





"And [player]..."





"If [red]Medli[white] gets stuck and cannot continue in
the temple, use the [red]Wind Waker[white] to conduct
the [red]song [white]you learned in the Tower of the
Gods. Do you understand?"





"[player], protect Medli.
And Medli, protect [player].


The power to repel evil shall surely be
returned to the Master Sword!"

"He's got such a distinguished chin...
And he's always walking back and forth."





"Hey, I've had something on my mind ever
since the [red]pictographer [white]who lives in the red
brick building told me my fortune."





"He told me that if I send a beautiful
pictograph of myself to the one who has
captured my heart, true love will blossom
in return..."





"So I couldn't help but notice...that you
have a [red]Picto Box [white]of your own, don't you?
Do you think you could take a pictograph
of me to the apple of my eye?
Maybe he'll notice my affections...
[two_choices]Leave it to me!
Keep me out of this!"





"Really?! How splendid!



Be sure to get my good side!



Oh! I want to show off this outfit, so
don't just take a pictograph of my face.
Can you be sure to get [red]my whole body[white] in
the pictograph?"





"Well, that's just plain mean!"





"After you do your little \"CLICK! CLICK!\"
and take my pictograph, be sure to take
it to him for me!"





"[size=75]Then surely..."





"[size=75]Maybe... He'll come tomorrow!"





"The two of us...are going to start dating!
Don't we make a delightful couple?"





"I'm so happy! And that's why I want to
share some of our happiness with you!"





"Take good care of it!"





"You delivered my pictograph, didn't you?
Well, it looks like that was what brought us
together... Thank you so much!"





"Thanks to you, [red]Anton[white] and I have grown so
close to one another.
...Thank you so much!"





"You...don't look at all familiar, buddy.
Are you some kind of tourist or something?
If you are, I'll show you around_why don't
you join me for a little stroll around town?"





"Our [red]Windfall Island[white] may be a little cozy,
so to speak, but people from all over the
world come here. The town's always lively."





"Ha ha! Why, just walking around and
having a look at things is quite fun!
THAT'S the mark of a great town!"





"So anyway, taking strolls is kind of like a
hobby of mine. I'm always moving, buddy!
...But do you think it's strange for a young
guy like me to walk around so much?"





"Well, whatever. I'll tell you one thing:
Because I take so many strolls, I know all
the best walking courses in town."





"Take that little path beside the bomb shop,
for example. How many people in town know
that it kind of sneaks around behind the
building? I think I'm the only one, buddy!"





"I tell you, every time I walk by, she kind of
gives me that look... You know that look I'm
talking about? What do you suppose that
look could mean...?"





"There's this certain someone that I've had
my eye on lately. I don't know her name,
but boy, oh boy..."





"Whenever I think about her, my heart just
starts fluttering in my chest. I've never
felt anything like this before...

You think I'm catching a cold, buddy?"





"That's it! I've made up my mind! First,
I'm going to ask her out for [red]coffee[white], then,
if things seem to be going right, I'm going
to profess my love for her!"





"Urrgh... I just can't seem to settle down.
I'm so nervous... I mean, just when am I
supposed to invite her out, buddy?"





"Hey! It's you! Listen to this, will you?
I...DID...IT! I worked up my courage, and
I talked to her, and it was totally the
right move!
You know why, buddy? She likes me!
She actually likes me!"





"Everything's coming up roses for me...
Life IS good, buddy!"





"I'm so happy! And you, [red]Linda[white]...
You're so swell!"





"Oh! A pictograph, eh, buddy?"





"Say... Speaking of pictographs, did you
know we have a famous pictographer living
here on the island? [red]Lenzo[white] is his name."





"Have you met him yet, buddy?"





"...But man, is this a terrible pictograph!
Who is this, anyway?!"





"...Hmm, this one's not bad, but the color
just isn't right, somehow."





"Maybe because it's in black and white?"





"Ah! This girl...!



Actually, buddy, this is the girl I've had
my eye on lately."





"Wow! She really IS that pretty! I mean,
just seeing this pictograph reminds me
of how gorgeous that girl is...

But no! I'll never be happy with just a
mere pictograph! Never!"





"That's it! I've made my decision! I am going
to get that girl to go out with me!
It's got to be done, buddy!"





"I've got it! Maybe I'll invite her to join me
at the cafe bar_for coffee, of course!


...So what's her name, anyway?
Do you think she's nice?
Does she have a steady fellow?
Ohhhhh, I'm so NERVOUS!"





"Oh, that's nice, buddy!"





"Yep, to sailors like us, the wind's our
whole life! It'd sure be nice if a fair wind
blew today..."





"Oh! There's a fair wind blowing to the west!"





"If you were to set sail and let this easterly
wind take you where it would, you'd end up
at a place called the [red]Mother & Child Isles[white].
It's a real pleasant sail_not too far away."





"But the thing is, the mother island is
pretty much surrounded by this high rock
wall. There's no way anyone'll ever get in
there...unless they can [red]fly[white], of course!"





"Oh, there's no fair wind blowing west
right now."





"Yup, we men of the sea are real sensitive
when it comes to wind direction!"





"Squid.



...You ever been all ate up by one o' them
squid out on the Great Sea?
[two_choices]Oh yeah
Nope"





"Don't you go lyin', now! Why, stick any
other sailor out there in my position and
he'd be belly-up. He'd have been finished.
FINISHED, I'm tellin' you!
It's a darn good thing I'm about as
rough-and-tumble a sailor as you'll ever
meet! Oh, you better believe it!"





"This one time, our ship got caught in this
giant whirlpool, you get me? And what's
there waitin' for us in the middle of it?
...The giantest squid you ever seen!"





"All over its body the thing had these
beady, gnarly, glowin' eyes...
And I don't even KNOW what was goin'
on with its tentacles!"





"...Now that I'm thinkin' on it, those were
the squirreliest eyes I ever seen! If I ever
come across that beastie again, I'll whale
him in the eyes. THAT'S what I'll do!"





"The sea's a fine thing, to be sure, but it's
not until I get back to town again that I
can really relax, know what I mean?"





"And when I see the area around this fine-
lookin' gate we got here... Well, that's
when I really start feelin' good. Yeah,
that gate in particular just says...
\"At long last, you're home, boy!\"
...I s'pose that's the feelin' I'm
talkin' about. That comin'-home feelin'."





"That huge gate there at the entrance to
town is one of Windfall Island's most
famous features. No matter how much I see
it, I never get tired of it, you know?"





"Hey, by the by, there's a statue way up
there on top of the gate that looks kinda
familiar somehow...

...Is that [red]Zunari the Shop Master[white]?"





"Hey, by the by, there's a statue way up
there on top of the gate that looks kinda
familiar somehow...

Is that an idol carved in the style of the
[red]Rito Tribe[white]? That's a mighty nice lookin'
statue, if it is. Well, I guess it's mighty
nice even if it isn't a Rito, but still."





"Hey, by the by, the top of that gate is
lookin' mighty fancy, if you ask me.


...Is there some kinda festival today
or somethin'?"





"Hey, by the by, the top of that gate is
lookin' mighty regal these days!
...A lover of flags such as myself can't
get enough of it, know what I mean?"





"Hey, by the by, they seem to have put all
sorts of statues on top of that gate...
It's a mighty peculiar way of decoratin' the
thing, but I like it, know what I mean?"





"Hey, by the by, don't it look like they've
tried to spice that gate up by decoratin' it
and such?

I think so, too. But whoever did it don't
have no sense of pomp and circumstance
at all, do they?!

I gotta tell you, before I became a sailor,
I wanted to be an [red]artist[white], so when it comes
to ar-tis-tic expression, I'm kind of a snob,
know what I mean? A good snob."





"But I gotta admit, it'd be nice to have that
gate decorated proper. You know, with a
true sense of decorative style...

Ain't there any youngsters around who
want to be [red]artists[white] anymore?"





"Look at that! It's brilliant! It makes
me so happy to see the gate like that!
...Here! I want you to have this!"





"What inspired you to decorate that gate?
What, are you tryin' to be an [red]artist
[white]or somethin'?

Well, nice work, I say! Nice work!"





"Heh heh...
What are you doin' in a place like this
at such a late hour?

Isn't it bedtime for all the little brats?"





"Yeah, yeah. Step right up."





"Eh?"





"Oh, you again?"





"You like this place, eh?"





"Wow. Haven't seen you around here for a
while. You must be a busy little kid..."





"If you have confidence in your [red]target
shooting[white], why don't you give this a shot?"





"It's [magenta]50 Rupees [white]per game. Wanna try?
[two_choices]You bet
No thanks"





"[size=150]Ah!"





"[size=75]...Oh... Never mind... My mistake..."





"Yeah, whatever.
Come again. Or not."





"Umm, it's [magenta]50 Rupees[white] per game..."





"All right. Now then...
Ermm... EH-HEM!"





"Oh! Ho! Ho!
[wait=10]So, you're the little shrimp who
thinks he's a target-shooting hotshot, yeah?"





"And you say this knowing full well that we
are pirates who are so frightening that
crying babies shut their mouths when we
step into the room?!"





"Har! This should be funny!
Fine then, hotshot!"





"If you can manage to sink the [red]5[white] pirate
ships you see off on the horizon, we'll
acknowledge your skills with a cannon,
you shrimpy little landlubber!
HOWEVER! We won't tolerate any comments
about how the pirate ships look like
barrels! And you get only [red]10 shots[white]!
You heard me!
You can [red]move [white]your cannon with [control_stick][red] [white]and
[red]fire[white] it with [a]. Watch the water plumes
carefully when you fire, yeah?"





"You got it, shrimp?
[two_choices]I got it!
Not really..."





"Then clean out your ears and listen up!"





"If you manage to sink all [red]5[white] pirate ships,
we'll give you all the [red]treasure[white] we've
stolen up until now! Good luck to you,
shrimp! You'll need it, yeah?"





"Oh! Ho! Ho!
You again, shrimp!?"





"So, our little shrimp has returned to us."





"Oh... Too bad."





"It's [magenta]50 Rupees[white] per game...



Want to try again?
[two_choices]Sure
No thanks"





"Psssh!
[wait=10]Wow![wait=10] Nice shooting...


But we won't hand over our priceless
[red]treasure[white] so easily, yeah?"

"You're a talented little kid!

and look at this! It's YOU again! Look at
you and that adorably cute face of yours!

I can't help but give away our [red]treasure
[white]to you. It's yours, so take it!"





"Did that boy beat you guys again!?
Give me a break! This is ridiculous!"





"Are you sure a kid like you should be
playing in a seedy place like this?


Oh well, a promise is a promise! Take our[red]

title, it'd be a Know-It-All Sailor. I'm wise.
Learned. Experienced. G'head, ask me
anything you want to know about the sea."





"I know it sounds kind of odd for me to say
this about myself, but you should know that
my mood changes with the wind. I'm a
whirlwind of emotion, laddie! Aye!
...But don't let that stop you from asking
me anything you want to know! Ask away!"





"Right now the wind is blowing to the north.
Say, that reminds me... There's an island to
the north that blasts out mighty gusts of
wind. Aye, a mysterious place... "





"No one can get near it... It's like the very
breath of the earth is gushing out from the
bellows of the world. I tell you, laddie,
that's no average wind!"





"I don't think anyone could fight through
that wind_not unless he were a real hefty
bloke. Even a guy like me would be blown
back like a feather! And I'm a burly sort!"





"So the wind is blowing to the northwest
now, is it? Interesting, laddie!"





"Aye, now that I think about it... There's a
strangely magical island northwest of here.
It's the kind of place that feels like it
came straight out of a fairy tale."





"Why, I've even got mates who claim to have
seen fairies on that island...but who knows
whether they're telling the truth or not.
The boys are prone to...boasting a wee bit."





"So the wind is blowing to the northeast?
A nor'easter, is it, laddie?"





"Y'know, when you're out at sea at night,
and you take a look at the sky, the stars
are just amazing. In fact, when the weather
is fair, you can see the Big Dipper up there."





"I don't know why that just sprung to mind,
to tell you the truth. You can see the Big
Dipper anywhere, not just northeast of here."





"The wind is blowing west today, laddie!
Ah, west... There's a mighty interesting
island due west of here. Aye, so there is."





"There's a gigantic cannon on it, and it's
manned by a suspicious-looking bloke.
Rumor has it, he's got something mighty
peculiar that he's showing off there."





"I sure wouldn't mind taking a gander at
whatever it is myself, laddie!"





"So, the wind blows east, does it, laddie?
Have you seen the mountain far to the east
of this island? The [red]volcanic isle[white] that spews
molten lava?! Oh, not a nice place! "





"Legend tells of a powerful treasure that lies
waiting for one who can brave the very
bowels of the earth and lay claim to it!
Aye, that tale's famous amongst us sailors!"





"That treasure... If the rumors are true, it can
turn you into a titan! Aye! It bestows so
much strength upon you, you could lift
stones the size of small islands, laddie!"





"...WHAT?!?
You already got that treasure!?
You can't be serious, laddie!"





"Why, I've heard just getting your hands
on that treasure makes you sturdy enough
to stand in the face of the fiercest winds!"





"Not many know of it, but there's an [red]island
of ice[white] far to the south. Aye, it's said to be
wrapped in a biting blizzard so nasty, it
can freeze visitors solid in their tracks!"





"But there's said to be a great treasure
hidden there, amongst the savage snows.
Or so the sailors tell..."





"Y'know, laddie, I've seen some odd things,
but nothing so odd as this one island. It
was far, far to the south of this town, and
it was home to this humongous head!"





"I've got to say, laddie, it looked to me like
that head was on watch...like there was 
something that it was guarding...
Maybe something below it..."





"But I never confirmed my suspicions. That
stone head was so heavy, I almost threw
my back out trying to move it! Aye, you'd
need unnatural strength to lift that thing!"





"So the wind blows to the southeast, does
she? Southeast..."





"Now that I think about it, I recall seeing the
strangest of houses on a lonely little
isle to the south. It seemed downright
[red]out of place[white] to me, laddie..."





"I don't know what kind of fool goes
building a cabana in these treacherous
seas... But whoever did it has got some
nerve, I tell you! Oh, aye!"





"Ahhhhhhh! Nothin' better than a cup of
refreshment at your local cafe after a long
day's work... Nothin'!"





"My story is a strange one... I came across
cursed seas from a land far away...a land
where the blizzards blow violently...heading
for this town called [red]Windfall[white]."





"But dear me! As I traveled, a terrible storm
descended and tore my ship to bits...yet
mysteriously, only [red]that[white] escaped without
so much as a mark on it..."





"From the looks of you, I would say you
are a traveler as well. Oh, yes indeed!
...Could you not purchase [red]that[white] from me?
It is my one and only heirloom from home.
The people of this town do not seem the
least bit interested in [red]that[white], despite the
fact that it would help them travel the
dangerous seas about their town...
Please! I beg of you! I wish to open a
business here in this town, so I am in
desperate need of finances!"





"How does...[red]80 Rupees[white] sound?
[two_choices]I'll buy it
I don't need it"





"Why, you don't have enough [red]Rupees[white]!
...You are a pitiable soul yourself!"





"Ooooooooh... Oh, dear me... Sadly, I have
nothing else I could possibly sell you.
I have naught but my hoodie coat_and it is
a keepsake from my dear, dear mother!"





"Ooooooooh... Please buy [red]that[white] from me!
Please purchase my only belonging!
[red]That[white] is a very, very fine thing indeed!"





"Yes, yes, yes! Thank you very much, indeed!
I have received precisely [red]80 Rupees[white] for it.
I can use these funds to finance my new
business! Oh, dear me, what a happy day!"





"Very well, young master... As I promised,
please! Take [red]that[white]!!! "





"Yes, yes, yes! You have made a good
purchase today, my young master!


And you have saved my life and business
as well! Treasure it dearly! It is the finest
[red]sail[white] in the world! Treat it as such!"





"Windfall is a warm and bustling place, I
deem. I do believe I shall settle and open
my business here. Yes, yes, that is a plan!

Oh, yes! I must say, if you happen to come
across a [red]delivery bag[white] that looks handy for
carrying products, let me know! The first
thing I must do is find products to sell!"





"Yes? Who is it? I'm busy now!



I'm trying to grow wings, so I can go visit
my friends! It's not easy_so let me be!"





"[player], you know Medli, don't you?"





"I think something weird happened to her..."





"It stinks, too, because I went to all the
trouble of picking this flower to surprise
her with! And now she's not around!"





"Tell me if you spot Medli, will you?"





"[player]..."





"[wait=10]My flower... [wait=10]It wilted..."





"The joy on Medli's face when she saw this
flower... [wait=10]I really wanted to see that..."





"Medli...
[wait=10]I wonder where she's gone..."





"My dear! Did you bring me [red]Joy Pendants
[white]yet again?"





"How many [red]Joy Pendants[white] have you brought?
[red][ms_marie_pendant_count][white]...?"





"My goodness! When I put these together
with the ones you've already brought
me, they add up to a whopping [red][ms_marie_pendant_total][white]!
Oh, thank you! THANK YOU! I'm so joyful!"





"...To receive so many mountains of these
beautiful pendants... I am quite simply
brimming with joy, my dear!"





"To thank you, I have to give you my most
precious of precious belongings!
I shall give you...this very special
piece of [red]jewelry[white]!"





"Now, close your eyes, dear...
This [red]item is so rare[white], there is not
another like it anywhere in the world!"





"What do you think? Isn't it dashing? It is
the rarest of things, and it will show you
its true worth [red]when you wear it in the
presence of a monster[white]."





"For now, just select it on your [red]Quest
Status Screen[white] to put it on.
...And when you do, promise to think of me
and treasure it with all your heart!"





"My, oh my, oh my! Have you brought me
[red]Joy Pendants[white] again? Again? Oh, thank you,
you sweet little dear! Thank you!"





"My goodness! When I put these together
with the others you've given me, I now have
a total of [red][ms_marie_pendant_total][white]!
Why, I'm so joyful, it's frightening!"





"And you, my little darling dear, you are like
the [red]Champion of Making People Joyful[white]!
Please, take this, you noble champion!"





"It's not much, but even you need some
pocket change, right, dear?

...But let's keep this just between us."





"But now that I think about it, my room is
filled with these pendants now...
Are you sure you haven't been going a
little overboard with these things?"





"By the way, how is your [red]cabana[white]?
Have you been to see it yet?


It's next to the [red]Triangle Islands[white]
south of here. Don't forget, dear!"





""





"This is the [red]Wind Waker[white]! It is a baton of
sorts that was used long ago when the
people played music in prayer to the gods.

In those days, simply using it allowed one
to borrow the power of the gods, but
I do not know if it still works.

Even so, I thought it might be of some use
to you. Perhaps you should try using it."





"You know, I've been a teacher here for a
long time... It's tough to put one past me.
That being said, I'm pretty sure I know who
put you up to this, dear.
Those little sweeties! I'm so joyful! It's the
best birthday present I could ask for!"





"I suppose I ought to thank you!
Close your eyes, dear..."





"And if you see those boys again, tell them
I say hello!"





"Oh, if it's [red]Joy Pendants[white], I suppose I'll take
them this time. But I think double-digit
amounts of joy are enough for me!

To be honest, I can actually only count to
99, anyway.


...But that's fine! I'm not a math teacher.


...Hey! Don't look at me like that!"





"People from all over the world seem to
gather here on [red]Windfall Island[white], all hoping
to become successful merchants.

I suppose you could say that this is the
island where people and money come
together. But you know what...?

Money is important, sure...but don't you
think people need to open their hearts a
little more than their wallets?"





"I've been kicking around this crazy world
for a long time, and I've learned to stop
and sniff the flowers along the way!"





"[sound=261]'Hoy! Hold it right there, small fry!"





"I don't know where you got your mitts on
that [red]Sea Chart[white] you got there..."





"But it looks to me like it's pretty much got
nothing but seas drawn on it!


It's pathetic! In fact, it's almost an insult to
call that thing a [red]Sea Chart[white], if you ask me!"





"[sound=264]What's the matter, small fry? I'm just trying
to be nice here! I'm telling you that you've
got a problem. And you do.

Don't give me that stupefied look! It makes
you look like you oughta be in diapers!"





"Just listen, OK? I'm here to teach you what
I know about this island, so open up your
[red]Sea Chart[white]! And make it snappy!"





"That's all I can teach you, small fry!



But I will do this for you, since I'm feeling
so generous: I'll send word to all my
brethren living near the islands of the
Great Sea. Good bunch of fish.
If you see a fish [red]leaping[white] out of the water
when you sail near an island, sail up to it
and spread [red]bait[white] out on the water's surface.
Trust me, this is good advice, fry. 
See, the baiting process allows you to get
a [red]chart[white] of the island, along with any [red]info
[white]that might be of use to you. I HIGHLY
recommend you make a habit of doing so.
See, you're [red]definitely[white] going to need a
reliable [red]Sea Chart[white] to help you search for
things out at sea. I can't emphasize that
enough, fry. You NEED a well-drawn chart.
If you don't get a chart for every island
you come across, it'll just be a bigger
hassle for you later on! Now don't say I
never did anything for you, fry!"





"'Hoy! You there! You Kingly Red Lion guy!
That's it! I've repaid my debt! I'm done!
You take care of the rest!"





"[sound=261]`Hoy, small fry!"





"Yeah, yeah, I've heard. I take it you want a
[red]chart[white] and [red]information [white]about this island?


Then start by opening up your [red]Sea Chart[white]!"





"And that's all the info I've got to offer!



If you want to hear it again, you'll have
to throw some more [red]bait[white] on the water for
me! Sorry, but that's my policy, fry!

I can't go fighting evil on an empty
stomach, you know!"





"And with that...I'm off!"





"[sound=262]Aww! Gimme a break! What's with using the
same bait all the time? Don't they make a
premium brand of this stuff?

Oh, well. Such is the life of a fish. So...
You want to hear the [red]info [white]about this here
island again?"





""





"And that's all the info I've got for you, fry!



You'd better be thankful for the clues you
got from me! I'm serious!"





"And with that...I'm off!"





"Hey... Have you ever seen what I call the
frightening fish-men?"





"Check this out... The other day I was out
at sea on a cruise, and without thinking
much about it, I tossed some leftover
bait out on the waves..."





"And you will NEVER guess what happened!



This fishy-looking thing popped up on the
surface, but it was no ordinary fish! It had
this weird, human-looking smile on its face,
and it just gobbled up the bait!"





"The ocean is so very vast. Many mysterious
things that we've yet to even dream of lie
sleeping beneath its waves..."





"You'd better remember this! Even if you see
a shadow underwater that you THINK looks
like a fish, whatever you do, don't throw
bait out for it, OK?
Because if you do, one of the dreaded
fish-men might appear and pull you
underwater with him!"





"So, I'm feelin' pretty good. Why? 'Cause I
recently got myself a pet pig. Three, in fact!
I got a black-splotched pig, too! How often
do you see one of those? Not often, chum."





"I've let 'em ashore to graze over yonder.
...But the thing is, I can't stop worryin'
about the little guys!"





"Hey! What are you doin', lollygaggin'
around! There's only [pig_game_time] left!"





"See, if I don't get 'em out and exercise 'em
once in a while, they pick up excess flab!
Nobody likes an extra-fat pig, chum!

...So I'll be countin' on you to handle
this tomorrow, too!"





"Hey, just so you know, if you ever have
money issues, I give good financial advice.
You come talk to me anytime, chum! I may
not look rich, but I've got plenty of cash!"





"Oh... You got that look about you...that look
that says you've run into some tight money
troubles... Am I right, chum?"





"You got any interest in takin' care of my
pigs for me? I'll pay cash, chum!
[two_choices]Definitely
I'm not that desperate"





"You want to baby-sit my pigs again?
[two_choices]Definitely
I'm not that desperate"





"...You aren't a very likable kid, are you?"





"Really?! Then let me explain..."





"I've let three pigs loose on this island, but
now I'm a little worried about one of 'em."





"Is he hungry? Has he gotten sick? Is he
lonely? Angry? Depressed? I can't help
worryin' about him, so I want you to find
the little guy and bring him back to me.
If you can do it in under [red][pig_game_time][white],
I'll give you some pocket change!"





"As for how you tell this guy apart from
the others... Well, it's easy, chum!
He's [red]the pig that angers easily[white].

That pig's precious to me! Bring him back
here without injuring him and press [r] to
set him down beside me, all right?"





"As for how you tell this guy apart from
the others... Well, it's simple, chum!
He's [red]the stinky pig[white].

That pig's precious to me! Bring him back
here without injuring him and press [r] to
set him down beside me. All right?"





"As for how you tell this guy apart from
the others... Well, it's real easy, chum!
He's [red]the slightly stupid pig[white].

That pig's precious to me! Bring him back
here without injuring him and press [r] to
set him down beside me. All right?"





"Are you ready, chum?
[two_choices]Absolutely
I'm not sure..."





"Then let me explain it to you once more..."





"All right! Startin' now, you have to do it
within [red][pig_game_time][white]! Ready[wait=10].[wait=10].[wait=10].[wait=10]?"





"GO!!![wait_dismiss=12]"





"What's that, chum?!"





"Oh! Did you go and bring me another
[red]Skull Necklace[white]?"





"Oh! Chum! That's a [red]Skull Necklace[white]!



I collect these things! ...But how'd you
know that?!"





"I can sell these for huge profits at antique
stores. Which reminds me, there's somethin'
I want to talk to you about, chum..."





"Could you give me [red]three[white] of these? If you
do, I'll let you play a really fun game.
[two_choices]I'll give you three
Good-bye"





"...I can't stand you, chum...p!"





"Hey, now! You don't have enough of 'em!
Don't rile me up like that, chum!"





"Thanks, chum! I'm happy to take 'em off
your hands!"





"All right, then! Now I'll let you play my
little game. It's called...[red]Piggy-Sitting[white]!"





"I've let three pigs loose on this island.
You have to bring 'em all back to
me within [red][pig_game_time][white]!"





"If you do a good job, I'll pay you for your
trouble! Are you ready, chum?
[two_choices]Absolutely
I'm not sure..."





"All right! Bring 'em all to me within
[red][pig_game_time][white]_startin' now!
Ready[wait=10].[wait=10].[wait=10].[wait=10]?[wait=10]"





"Oh... Too bad! Time's up! If you can't beat
my pigs, I guess you're still a little green,
chum! But don't sweat it!"





"Hey! Why didn't you show up yesterday???
I was waitin' all day for you, chum!
Oh, well... I guess that's all water under
the ship's bridge..."





"Way to go, chum! I don't know how you
figured out how to catch 'em all_this guy
in particular!"





"Oinky, oinky! Looks like you're full of
energy! I guess I didn't need to worry
after all. Well, thanks for playin', chum!"





"Oh, yeah! I guess a promise is a promise...
I owe you a little pocket change, don't I?
All right, hold out your hand, chum!"





"I'm sure it was a good work-out for my pig,
too. Thanks again, chum!"





""





"Well, whatever. I guess I can let you
make one mistake. But hurry up! You only
have [pig_game_time] left!"





"Boooo! Wrong!
...I said I'd let you make one mistake, right?
ONE!"





"I guess you can't beat my pigs at their
own game! ...You're still a little green,
chum! But don't sweat it!"





"Wow! You found the third one! Nice work!
Well, chum...
You win."





"But still... Cripes! How could my little
piggies lose like that...? They must be out
of shape_time for an exercise regimen!
Things won't go so easy for you next time!"





"Oh-ho! The first one arrives!
...You got [pig_game_time] left, chum!"





"The second one shows up! Well, chum,
there's only [pig_game_time] left!"





"Have you by chance seen...any
[red]Skull Necklaces[white]?"





"My son is a sailor, but lately he's been
obsessed with collecting Skull Necklaces.
He never pays attention to his dear mum
anymore! He just goes on about necklaces!"





"You did it! Nice work! Perhaps next time
you can take me out to the cafe for a
drink afterwards!"





"Why, that was so easy! You see, this is
how one wins with dignity!"





"Aww... This bug in my belly just won't
settle down... I'm going straight home to
drown my sorrows in food!"





"You little darling...
Could I adopt you?"





"That's the only way the auction could end!
I'm a fierce competitor at everything I do!"





"I suppose there's no beating time...
I think I got a few more wrinkles tonight!"





"Young man, you shouldn't be so loose with
your wallet. I mean, you must have gone
through a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to
earn that kind of cash!"





"Well, I suppose good things DO come to
those who wait! Imagine that!
...Maybe I have more talent for this
sort of thing than I thought!"





"What's with that person!? Why, I've never
seen a pair of eyes change color like that
at the mere mention of the word \"auction\"!"





"Wow! I'm impressed! It looks like the
old gal doesn't win this time..."





"I did it! I tell you, I know how to use
my experience to make the most of any
situation! They did once call me \"Miss
Auction,\" I'll have you know!"





"Oh, well... But next time, I'll come bidding
like a racehorse right out of the gates!"

filthy rich is this kid, anyway?!)"

senses, you wanna play again, right?"





"Oh! Way to be!"

They're all yours. Enjoy, kiddo!"

and do it again sometime."





"What are you doin'? You gotta cross the
finish line [red]BEFORE time runs out[white]!
Otherwise I can't give you any Rupees!
C'mon, kiddo, use your brain!"

finish line without collectin' a single
Rupee? And I mean a major foul."

Me, I just like to sit and gaze at the night
sky. That's all the hobby I need."





"If you have anything that's good for looking
at the night sky, have a look at that moon.
I highly recommend it."





"Well? Cool, right? Doesn't looking at the
moon just cleanse your soul?"





"If you want to know the truth, I'm actually
a little...heartbroken...at the moment. I just
can't shake this depression."





"See, I found out that my childhood friend
Linda had her eyes on someone besides me
all this time... And you know what's worse?
He was my buddy! I just can't take it!"

sorry if you got wrapped up in it."





"Hmph! Nobody understands how I feel.

...Do me a favor? Beat it!"





"What a jerk! How did he manage that?!
Right under my nose!"





"[size=75]But I guess he IS an all-right guy..."





"You pesky little brat! Nobody understands
how I feel! Do you hear me? Nobody!
Not you! Not anybody!"





"Wait...



Are you trying to tell me that you DO
understand how I feel?
[two_choices]Completely
I couldn't care less"





"Jerk!"





"...Oh, really? Then how about a little test
to see if you really do!"





"I want you to show me a picture of the
first [red]perfectly round[white], [red]pale thing[white] you can
think of."





"If you show me something that's exactly the
same as my favorite thing, then you win,
and I'll acknowledge...that you understand
the inner workings of my heart and mind.
It's quite a simple little riddle, isn't it?
Quickly, now! Bring it to me!"





"Wow! I feel totally rejuvenated, and its all
because of you!
...Thanks a lot!"





"What in the...?
Why are you so proud of this terrible
picture? Am I supposed to be impressed?

Let me tell you, if you don't show me a
zoomed-in pictograph of my favorite thing,
I can't be certain you know how I feel!
And then I'll consider you a liar!"





"Oh, too bad...
The point of focus isn't exactly bad...
but it's not quite right, either."





"...What's round about this? Nothing!
I said [red]something perfectly round and pale[white]!"





"What's pale about this? Nothing!
I said [red]something perfectly round and pale[white]!"





"Oooooh! That's right! That certainly is the
pictograph I'm looking for! The correct
answer is exactly what you've shown me:
the [red]full moon[white]!"





"Unrequited love may have twisted me up
inside, but I can still find peace when I
gaze at the timeless moon...

And of all her phases, I particularly love
gazing at the [red]full moon[white]!"





"I know I caused you a lot of trouble,
but...thanks!


I really mean it! I want you to have this for
all your efforts. Just a little reward for
easing the pain of this troubled heart."





"This supposedly has a spot on it that
marks where some sunken treasure lies.


I don't have a boat, so I can't leave this
island to go look for it anyway."





"Tonight I'll be asking the night sky to help
you find the treasure! Best of luck!"





"Yes! Tonight is a full moon!"





"Awww... I wanted to see Linda, not you."





"Heh heh! It's another fine moon tonight.
Say, did you know...?"





"Like the human heart, the shape of the
moon changes with time. Every night,
it becomes just a little bit different."





"Look at that! Aren't the three sister-stars
impressive? What a stellar family!"





"Heh heh heh heh! Do you know what the
name of that constellation is?"

"Har har harrrrr! You won't get any from us,
bub! Not likely!"





"Lemme ask you something real quick:
who wanders around on a fishless sea?


I'll tell you who, bub: Only pirates,
monsters, and treasure-hunters like
ourselves! And maybe some other things
that I've never heard of..."





"Y'know, with all the weak island-dwellers
who never leave their shores, I'm amazed to
see such a tiny little guy out here."





"I like your style, bub! I feel like I've known
you my whole life!"





"So hey, bub, tell you what! As one treasure-
hunter to another, I'll give you this...
You'll definitely be needing it if you want
to haul up treasure.
Come on! Take it! I won't take \"no\" for an
answer. I also won't take \"nay,\" \"nope,\"
or \"nar.\" Just grab it!

After that, all you need to do is use the
same thing we use to haul up treasure: one
of those [red]Grappling Hooks[white] that the Rito
tribesfolk of [red]Dragon Roost Island[white] use."

Use your [red]Grappling Hook[white] while [red]in your boat[white]!
Trust me, it'll work, bub!


The only other thing you need is patience!"

I mean, it's not brain surgery."





"Then quit bugging me!"





"To get treasure, you have to check
your Treasure Charts carefully and then
use your [red]Grappling Hook[white] to haul it up.

You do get that, don't you, bub?"

up pretty quickly because they don't get

treasure..."





"Keep it quiet, but our actual goal is to
find the legendary treasure that [red]sleeps at
the bottom of the sea[white]!

If you must know, bub, it's these golden,
triangular-shaped...


Triumph Forks!!! Yeah! Some sort of magical
cutlery! That's what we heard!"

secret, bub..."





"[player]...
As was the case with Medli, I have no
doubt that Makar, too, has some special
role to play in these events.
Discovering that role is your duty."

of you can overcome the dangers and
pitfalls of this temple..."

has already..."

".........."





"[sound=262]Why? What ails you? What?
Lose the long face!


The monsters are gone from the world!
Doesn't that make you a little happy?"





"[player], I have troubling news...



Ganon has not shown himself above the
seas since Valoo unleashed his fiery wrath
upon him.

And what's worse, there is not a creature
stirring in his base of operations in this
world...the Forsaken Fortress.

...I cannot imagine how it is possible,
and yet I cannot shake this foreboding
feeling I have about the princess, Zelda."





"[player], you must search for all the
[red]Triforce shards[white] so that we can head back
to Hyrule without delay!"





"[player]! You must sail to the
[red]Tower of the Gods[white] immediately!


We must go down to Hyrule with the
completed Triforce!"





"What are you doing?



Is the place you should be seeking not
marked on your [red]sea chart[white]?"





"What are you doing? Make haste! You must
go to the place [red]marked[white] on your sea chart!"





"[player]... I sense that terrible things
are happening...


Quickly! We must hurry on to the place
[red]marked[white] on your sea chart!"





"What are you doing?!



We must get to [red]Windfall[white] quickly and see
what we can learn of the [red]pirates' [white]motives."





"What is the matter, [player]?
It is time for you to return to your
homeland. We must sail to [red]Outset Island[white]."





"We cannot get inside the [red]cave [white]unless you
can destroy the [red]stone slab[white] that blocks its
entrance...and you must do it before we are
sucked into the whirlpool!
I suppose the only way to destroy a stone
slab that large is to break it into pieces,
[red]starting at the top[white]. Take care not to waste
your [red]bombs[white]."





"You must set one [red]pearl[white] in each of the
locations marked on your sea chart.
At that time, the place where your courage
will be tested shall become clear to us.
Come! We must press on, undeterred by the
rising tide of Ganon's evil designs!"





"Beyond this place, you must do battle with
the power of the gods...but even as you do
so, you must also borrow that power!"





"What are you doing?!



Quickly! You must rise up and meet the
challenge of the [red]Tower of the Gods[white].
It is the only way you can get the strength
you need to save your sister!"





"The power you must obtain lies ahead,
hidden [red]within the castle[white].


Go. Enter the castle. Do not get lost!"





"At long last, our preparations are complete.
You must return to me so that we can return
by the same path that brought us here.

The time has come to save your sister from
her prison in the Forsaken Fortress!
Hurry, [player]!"





"Why do you delay? We must head for the
[red]Forsaken Fortress[white] to save your sister!"





"Your sister is being held at the top of the
[red]central tower[white]! [wait=10]...I hope you have not
forgotten how to get there!"





"The temples where the sages await cannot
be entered easily.


It is at times such as this when one would
be wise to gather information from [red]those
who live in the seas[white] nearby."





"So, Ganon's reach has extended to the very
sages themselves...


The hint that will help us find the [red]new sage
[white]can be found in the [red]shape of the instrument
[white]on the [red]rock door[white].

Does it not look familiar to you?"





"What is the matter? Quickly! Guide this one
to the temple so the Master Sword can
regain its power!"





"Why do you tarry? Power has not fully
returned to the Master Sword..."





"The Master Sword's power still has not
fully returned. Perhaps I am mistaken,
but I fear the worst for the sage in
the remaining temple.
You must hurry, [player]!"





"You must guide a [red]new sage [white]to the remaining
[red]temple[white] if the Master Sword is to regain all
of its power!

If we are ever to ease poor [red]Fado's[white] regret,
we must seek out the new sage!"





"Why do you delay? You must guide this
one to the temple if the power to repel
evil is to be returned to the Master Sword!"





"What distracts you? The Master Sword still
has not recovered the power to repel evil..."





"We cannot return to Hyrule without first
re-forming a piece of the Triforce.


It is now our duty to gather the
[red]eight Triforce shards[white]!"





"The Triforce you possess is complete.
We must make for the [red]Tower of the Gods
[white]and return to Hyrule."





"What are you doing? The path to Hyrule
has already been opened! We must return
to where Princess Zelda waits!"





"I am concerned about Princess Zelda...
Quickly! Go into the castle and confirm
her safety!"





"So, despite our efforts, the princess has
fallen into Ganon's hands...

Yet all is not lost...
Beyond the bridge on the far side of the
castle stands [red]Ganon's Tower[white]. I am certain
Zelda is being held there.

Now that the Master Sword is once again
blessed with the power to repel evil,
you should be able to break through
[red]Ganon's Barrier[white] and enter the tower!"





"Long ago, Ganon's Tower was an
impenetrable fortress that not even
the daring and dauntless Knights of
Hyrule could hope to assail.
You must sharpen your senses so as not to
fall victim to Ganon's illusions."





"If you wish to return to the world above,
then climb aboard and enter the light!"





"The world above is still calm and peaceful.
...But the future is bleak. If Ganon is able
to absorb Zelda's powers...

[player], we must return to Ganon's
Tower as soon as your errands are
complete. You must rescue Zelda from
Ganon's clutches at all costs!"





"Ganon has likely been made aware of our
little incursion already...


...But you have the Master Sword!



That sword shall shine in the darkness,
casting back evil... With it in your hands,
none can keep you from rescuing your
sister!
Do not be afraid!"





"I see... So this is the portal through which
Ganon was able to seep into the
unsuspecting world above...

[player], we shall make use of this
path that Ganon created for himself.


If there is anything from the world above
that you believe you need, then climb into
the boat and enter the column of darkness!"





"Do you sleep still?"





"Wait!"





"Do not be so hasty, boy..."





"I can see this girl's dreams...



[wait=15]Oceans...
[wait=15]Oceans...


[wait=15]Oceans...
[wait=15]Oceans...


[wait=30]Oceans as far as the eye can see."





"They are vast seas...[wait=15]
None can swim across them...
They yield no fish to catch..."





"What did the King of Hyrule say?
[wait=30]...That the gods sealed Hyrule away?"





"And they left behind people who would
one day awaken Hyrule?!"





"[wait=30]How ridiculous...



So many pathetic creatures, scattered
across a handful of islands,[wait=15] drifting on this
sea like fallen leaves on a forgotten pool...
What can they possibly hope to achieve?"

Komali's never once complained, though I'm
sure he's been lonely at times. He's the
chieftain's son through and through.
However, his grandmother passed recently,
and Komali seems lost. His confidence is...
gone. His grandmother was always with

The Energy of Life
To be young is to know no limits to
one's stamina. To become stronger, one
must first know oneself.

The [red][heart][heart][heart][white] in the upper-left shows one's
current [red]life energy[white]. Perhaps a fancier way
to describe it would be to call it a life
gauge.
As one experiences trials and hardships in
life, one will naturally gain more [red][heart]s[white].


However, if one is injured and takes
[red]damage[white], those [red][heart]s[white] will decrease. At such
times it may be possible to replenish one's
health by cutting grass and finding hearts."

Do Not Underestimate the Sea
It's easy to get swept up by a little success

Swimming for too long will drain one's
energy, and eventually one will sink.
Watch the round icon in the [red]bottom-right[white]
while in the water. This is one's [red]swim timer[white].


One should be sure to get back to shore
before one's swim timer runs out. If one

the lower-left.

The [yellow]yellow arrow[white] shows one's current

the map with [d_pad][left_arrow].

Material Goods
The more things one tries to experience

belongings one tends to gather.

And, of course, with those belongings
comes a need to keep track of them and
keep them in good order.

One needs only to press START/PAUSE to
see the items he or she has obtained.


The [red]Items screen[white] contains items the
player can set to and use with

How Not to Regret the Things One Fails to
Do in Life. A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON!


There are many things one longs to do in
the limited time one has in this world.
The easiest way not to regret things one
wanted, but failed, to do is to [red]save[white].
While one may feel invincible and wish to
continue one's quest, one never knows when
disaster or calamity may strike.

If one's life energy is extinguished before
one has had a chance to save, then one's
life will have been lived in vain.

It is a shame to regret the deeds one has
failed to accomplish in life. Press

Improving Human Relations
To improve one's relations with one's
fellow beings, one must be outgoing and
press [a] to speak to all people one meets.

When one opens one's heart to others,
others will open their hearts in return
and offer wisdom on many important things.

If the person's advice is strange or cannot
be understood, one should not feel shy.
One should simply ask the person to repeat
the statement by pressing [a] again.
More often than not, if one asks politely,
a person will say the same thing over and
over again until the meaning is clear."

Knowing One's Own Abilities
To improve one's life, it is wise to watch
[a] and [r] calmly whenever one comes
across a person or an object.

By doing so, [a] and [r] will pass along
wisdom regarding how one can best interact
with that person or object. To know one's
own abilities is to know one's limits."

The young often assume that they can see

are missing out on a grander view.

By using [c_stick] to change perspective, one
can often find oneself gazing upon sights
and discoveries one never expected to see.

Once one has seen all there is to see
around oneself and determined an
appropriate course of action, it is wise
then to press [l] and take action.

up toward the top of the Forest Haven...


Don't you have a [red]Telescope[white]? I mean, who
doesn't in this day and age?"





"You have to hit that switch up there if you
want to get down into the [red]Nintendo Gallery
[white]nestled beneath this island.

If you had a [red]Telescope[white] you could probably
see what I'm talking about.
...That switch is a real pain!"

If you do, please show it!"

process is a trade secret, I'm afraid. I can't
let you take any pictographs of my work.
Could you come back tomorrow?"





"...What's this? This is in black and white!
Monochrome pictographs just don't provide
the kind of inspiration I need to create a
beautiful figurine, I'm afraid."





"Hmmm... Yes... This is a fine pictograph, but
it just isn't the type of thing that inspires
me. No, not even in the least bit."





"I'll buy up to [red][chu_jelly_count][white] of them."

figurine of this. Haven't you seen it yet?"





"Faces are the very soul of all figurines!
If you don't give me a shot where the
subject is completely facing the Picto Box,
I'm afraid I can't craft a figurine for you."





"Oh! Well, this is almost right...
If you only had taken a shot that showed
the subject's entire body, I'd be quite
inspired to craft a figurine of this."

Did one of our members provide you with
an introduction, I hope?"

We've been losing members due to our lack
of \"gimmicky attractions\"...but we don't
worry. True fans know we're the coolest.
So anyway, do you know what it takes to
become a member of our club?"

all been made using [red]pictographs [white]provided
by our devoted members."

Then you'll become a member, and you'll
become able to view the collection in our
galleries. And won't that be nice?"





"Do you have such a pictograph?"





"Would you like to be a member? Oh?
In that case, bring me a [red]pictograph
[white]that steals my breath away."





"As far as what kind of pictograph has the
power to steal my breath away...


Well, it can be either a person or a monster.
You just have to be careful to take a
[red]full-body [white]shot with your subject [red]facing you[white].[red][heart]"





"...But until you bring me a subject that I
like, you can't join. Sorry, but that's
the way the cookie crumbles!

I AM making these figurines for free, so I
figure I should be allowed this one little
rule, don't you?"





"Welcome, [player].
Did you find me a new subject?
Well, show it to me! [red][heart]"





"How do you like my figurine? Isn't it
marvelous? We do use only the highest
quality material, after all, so I suppose
it couldn't be anything less than lovely.
You can make figurines out of many
different materials, but I carve mine from

whose colors defy description.
Rainbow stone is a very precious material,

Wow! My lifelong dream has at long last
come true! Such joy!"

my dream! It's a [red]heart-filled reward[white]
brimming with gratitude!

All right, hold out your hands..."





"My, but I have received a worthy item!
Tonight, I will hold this close to my
bosom as I sleep!
...I can't wait!"





"...Don't you know? The hooded guy who
runs the little stall downstairs...
I think his name is [red]Zunari[white]...

Anyway, he's been hiding an incredible
treasure down there. That's what he says,
anyway. Something incredible."





"The fact is, he comes up here all the time
just to brag about it.


To be honest, I'm pretty tired of hearing
about it, whatever it is."





"Have you heard? About [red]Zunari[white]? You know,
that big-hooded man who runs the stall
just downstairs from here?

Well, I hear he had an incredible treasure
that he valued above all else in that safe
of his, but that he went and gave it to
some strange boy for no apparent reason!"





"\"My dear! I've gone and spread a little
joy to a pitiable boy! Dear me!\"
...That's what he said, with the most
serious of looks on his face. 
It was a real eye-opener! I mean, what a
great person! I've completely changed my
opinion of him!"





"[player], what's going on?



We must hurry to reach the [red]Earth Temple[white]!"





"[sound=228]Well, [player]...



I'm not very confident, but I think I should
try to fly...


I'll fly where you tell me to... 
Just tap [a] to keep me airborne!


OK, whenever you're ready... Just use the
[red]Wind Waker [white]to guide me."





"[player], what are you doing?



Please take me to the [red]Wind Temple[white].
Quickly!"





"[sound=268][player]...



I don't think I have the power to aid
you much, [player]...


But I can at least plant a tree here in this
soft soil...


If you conduct me, I can use [a] to
sow [red]seeds[white].


Use your [red]Wind Waker[white] to conduct me."

"[sound=268][player]!"





"The stone that blocks the entrance seems
extremely heavy.


The only way you could move it,
[player], is if you were to become
as [red]heavy[white] as the Great Deku Tree himself."





"[sound=268][player]!



[player], I think that the [red]Hookshot
[white]you have can probably latch onto the
trees I planted. Give it a try!"





"[player], I'm feeling a bit more
confident now.


I'm not sure how high I can fly while
carrying you, [player], but I'll
do the best that I can.

Just pick me up and[red] jump[white], OK?"





"It seems like the [red]instrument [white]I'm carrying
can [red]reflect [white]light!


This can help, I think! Instruct me where to
reflect the light and use [a] to [red]face [white]my
instrument in that direction.

Use the [red]Wind Waker [white]to guide me, OK?"





"[sound=277][player]!!
I'm over here!"





"[sound=228]Well... I just thought of something.



If we use your [red]shield [white]and my [red]instrument
[white]together, I think we can reflect light onto
two different places at once.

Do you think that'd be useful?"





"[sound=228]Well, I'm not sure how to...explain this...



I think the[red] light [white]that I reflect off of my
[red]instrument [white]can be redirected using
your [red]shield[white], [player]...

Do you think this could prove useful?



I hope you're not offended by my
suggestions. I just want to be helpful..."





"This is but one of the legends of which the
people speak..."





"Uh, [player]..."





"Were you listening to that?
Oh, how embarrassing...


I may have spoken to you about this
before, [player], but..."





"My, what beautiful stars!

a great day in pictography!"





"Today marks the day long past when I,
as a young lad still struggling to reach
the pinnacle of pictography, received
my very first [red]Legendary Pictograph[white]."





"A [red]Legendary Pictograph[white] is an image of a
being or essence that has passed
beyond the knowledge of this world.
They're quite incredible, really.
These are images that one comes across

I am the leading pictographer in the land,
I have managed to gather many of them."

I am willing to pass on to you one of these

Lately, his club has been losing membership
because he hasn't done anything \"cool\"
with it, but as long as [player]
hangs around, everything will be all right!"





"[red]Manny[white]

Talent: Herd movements

These little beasts are quick and agile.

"[red]Keese & Fire Keese[white]
Habitat: Dragon Roost Cavern
Least Favorite Thing: Projectiles

Habitat: Dragon Roost Cavern
Weakness: Water

These creatures are covered in a hard
exoskeleton that not even the searing heat
of lava can penetrate. Their eyes are their

"[red]Armos Knight[white]
Habitat: Tower of the Gods
Vulnerability: Bombs

These auto-homing statues were created to
deter intruders. To destroy them, you must
toss bombs into their gaping mouths."





"[red]Poe[white]
Habitat: Earth Temple

form, so physical attacks pass right
through them. Shining light on them with
the Mirror Shield makes them take form."





"[red]ReDead[white]

These undead creatures live only in the
darkest depths of the earth. Their icy cold

with a sword or shield."





"[red]Seahat[white]
Habitat: The Great Sea
Weakness: Projectiles

These tremendous flying fish can be found
only on the Great Sea. They tend to ram

is best to attack them from a distance."





"[red]Gyorg[white]
Habitat: The Great Sea
Weakness: Projectiles

These so-called ocean killing machines are
plentiful in the Great Sea. You should

they're able to knock you into the sea."





"[red]Moblin[white]
Habitat: Forsaken Fortress
Spoils: Skull Necklaces

These mighty enemies swing their long
spears with the greatest of ease. They've
knocked [player] around with that
attack countless times."





"[red]Mothula[white]
Habitat: Forbidden Woods
Effective Weapons: Deku Leaf, projectiles

This gigantic moth scatters its scales
through the air. Even using projectiles to
clip its wings won't assure safety_it can
still run around swiftly and release larvae."





"[red]Darknut[white]
Habitat: Tower of the Gods
Spoils: Knight's Crest

These mighty knights are protected by
heavy-duty armor. Rather than attacking
from the front, it might be best to slip
around behind them and cut their armor off."





"[red]Darknut[white]
Habitat: Earth Temple
Spoil: Knight's Crest

These knights are well protected by their
round bucklers and mighty armor. If you use
a parry attack to jump up and knock off
their helmets, it'll spell their doom."

Habitat: Hyrule Castle
Spoil: Knight's Crest

These are Darknut captains. Some wear
capes that must be burned or cut off before

 Light Arrows, Master Sword

deflect his magic attacks."





"[red]Stalfos[white]

"[red]Wizzrobe[white]
Habitat: Tower of the Gods
Magic: Fire, summons

These mighty mages are adept at wielding
flame and summoning other creatures to
their aid.

physical form."





"[red]Wizzrobe[white]
Habitat: Wind Temple
Magic: Summons

These high-level mages use the magic of
summoning to aid them in battle. They are

"[red]Big Octo[white]
Habitat: Great Sea
Effective Weapons: Projectiles

There are said to be six of these legendary
giant squid in different reaches of the Great
Sea. When ships pass by, they create
tremendous currents to try to sink them.

their weak spots_their eyes_with projectiles
before being sucked in."





"[red]Gohma[white]
Habitat: Dragon Roost Island
Effective Weapon: Grappling Hook

This gigantic shelled insect inhabits
areas of lava and magma. The only way to

"[red]Kalle Demos[white]
Habitat: Forbidden Woods
Favorite Thing: Makar

This plant-monster is a gigantic parasite
that lives in the depths of the

tentacles with the Boomerang will its tender
core be revealed."





"[red]Gohdan, The Great Arbiter[white]
Habitat: Tower of the Gods
Effective Weapon: Arrows

This monstrous machine was created by the
gods as a trial for the great hero. You can
drop it to the ground only by piercing
its hands and face with arrows.
Once it has fallen, you can defeat it by
immediately tossing a bomb inside it.
Oddly enough, arrows occasionally drop
from its nostrils."





"[red]The Monstrous Helmaroc King[white]
Habitat: Forsaken Fortress
Master: Ganondorf

The Helmaroc King is a monstrous bird that
has been fitted with a mighty steel mask.
Once the mask has been split with a
hammer, its tender beak will be revealed."





"[red]Jalhalla, Protector of the Seal[white]

tongue, then slash at it with your blade."





"[red]Puppet Ganon[white]
Habitat: Ganon's Castle
Effective Weapon: Light Arrows

This is a gigantic marionette created by
Ganon himself. It transforms into three
different shapes, but all are vulnerable
to rays of light.
Rather than shooting randomly at it, try
to deduce when it can be easily targeted
and then take advantage of your chance."





"[red]Ganondorf[white]
Base of Operations: Ganon's Castle
Effective Weapons:
 Light Arrows, Master Sword
The possessor of the Triforce of Power,
Ganondorf controls many fell beasts.

"[player], it is I, the King of Red
Lions. I am afraid there are some areas
to which you will not be able to bring
the servants of the tower.
But do not fear leaving them behind! Once
you have awakened them, they will wait
patiently for your return. Of this I
assure you!"





""





"[player], do not worry about
straying away from Medli in the depths of
the temple.

Just relax and open your [red]Dungeon Map[white].
As long as you have the [red]compass[white], you can
easily confirm her whereabouts."





"I hear there's a fellow on [red]Windfall Island
[white]who's collecting [red]Skull Necklaces[white]!


You know who it is, fry? I don't. Sorry.



What I CAN tell you is that those
piggish monsters you see here in the
[red]Forsaken Fortress[white] seem to carry those [red]Skull
Necklaces[white] around all the time.
Not that I think it's easy work stealing
anything from the likes of those guys."





"I hear that somewhere out in the wide world
is a handy[red] arrow that can freeze anything[white].


With something like that, you could even
freeze that nasty monster in the Forsaken
Fortress...for a while, anyway.

But then, what would you do with a frozen
monster, you say? Good question, fry.


Why, I'd say you'd give that thing a whack
and watch it shatter into teeny-tiny pieces!"





"The little [red]shop master[white] on Windfall Island
apparently got his hands on a truly
amazing [red]treasure[white].

He calls it [red]Magic Armor[white] or something like
that. It's a pretty cool magical relic,
from what I've heard.

If you want him to give it to you, try
staring deep into his eyes and winning
him over with flattery, fry!
Ahhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"





"Are you thinking you want to get into that
cave, small fry? The one that's protected
by the crazy winds on that island?

Heh heh heh! OK, then. Let me just tell you
a little secret...


If you go [red]five squares south[white] and [red]one square
east[white] from here, you'll reach [red]Ice Ring Isle[white],
where you'll find an item that will make
you [red]as heavy as stone[white]!
If you get that item, you won't have to
worry about getting blown over by winds."





"You'd best be careful sailing these waters
on [red]nights when the moon is full[white].


Well, if you like pure, soul-freezing horror,
fry, then maybe you can handle it."





"If you see [red]seagulls[white] flying all around some
sea waters, that's a sign that you need to
be wary, fry.

Because the seagulls flock to wherever
[red]Big Octos[white] appear... [red]BIG OCTOS[white], I tell you!
Those things don't mess around!"





"Hey, small fry, do you know about the
golden [wait=10]Triumph Forks[wait=10]?
They're there, I tell you... On that island...
The [red]chart[white]'s there, is what I mean to say.
But the cliff there rises sharply, and even
if you wanted to climb it, there aren't any
ledges or footings for you grab on to.

So? What are you going to do, small fry?"





"You've seen those weird [red]rings of light
[white]that appear on the surface of the sea,
haven't you, small fry?

Did you know that some of those rings only
appear at night? Didn't think so."





"They say that [red]inside[white] the ring of rock
that makes up the perimeter of that [red]island[white],
there lives an incredibly [red]beautiful fairy[white]!

But the thing is, nobody's ever met her.



Supposedly, the only way you'll ever meet
her is to take a ride on a whirlwind and
drop inside that rock perimeter from the
sky above. Doesn't sound easy, fry..."





"Beware the night when [red]the crescent moon
faces up[white]!


That's all I can tell you, small fry."





"Out on the cape of this island is this crazy
dancing fool who can't tell day from night! 


The guy's nuts...but you've got to respect
someone who's not afraid to just let it
all hang out like that, you know?

I've been watching him, thinking I'd try to
learn that dance and compete with him
from out here in the ocean...

But I just can't seem to swing with that
crazy, funky rhythm of his.
[wait=15][draw_instant]That guy's incredible![draw_char]"





"Do you know what a ChuChu is, small fry?
 


[wait=20]No, I'm not talking about the sound you
make when you kiss someone![red][heart][heart][white]
I'm talking about ChuChus!

They're those slimy, monster-like puddles of
goo that turn into blobs of jelly, stand up,
and start jumping at you like crazy when
you come near them. 
Well, in any case, there's lots of them on
that island over there, so if you see any,
I'd avoid them. They can get...nasty.

Now that I think about it, every once in a
while I see the [red]potion brewer[white] who lives on
[red]Windfall Island[white] come here...
Now why would he do that, fry?"





"There's a real peculiar [red]cave[white] toward the
backside of this here [red]Dragon Roost Island[white].


Yeah, real peculiar. But I doubt you'll ever
get there to see it, small fry_unless you
manage to sprout wings and fly, that is...

`Cause you won't be getting there otherwise!"





"To the west of here, over on [red]Dragon Roost
Island[white], you'll see all kinds of rocks.
Big ones, little ones...you get the picture.

Anyway, they say that long ago, there used
to be [red]treasure[white] hidden inside those things.


Who knows? There may still be some left,
so you should open your eyes and take a
good look around...from as high-up as the
sun to as low-down as your toes!"





"I hear the bird-people who live on [red]Dragon
Roost Island[white] east of here have invented
an incredibly useful device that they call
a [red]Grappling Hook[white]... No lie, fry!
I hear you can throw that thing at monsters
and use it to grab [red]treasure they've hidden
in their pockets[white]. Talk about cool.

Oh, and have you seen those [red]imp-like
creatures[white] called [red]Bokoblins[white] that hang out
on the lookout platforms at sea and stare
through their telescopes?
I hear those guys keep [red]Joy Pendants[white] hidden
in their pockets, so if you get one of
those Grappling Hooks, you can use it
to swipe their pendants!"





"I wonder how long it's been since the
light in Windfall's lighthouse went dark...


It was quite a grand sight, I tell you,
the way that ray of light shone out like a
shaft of gold through the cold darkness.
I used to gaze at it with dear Gillian...
Anyway, I bet if someone could shoot a
[red]powerful spark[white] into the top of that
lighthouse, it would light up again!

Of course, that's just my intuition
talking...


Then again, you should never doubt a fish's
intuition, small fry!"





"Let me tell you a little something about
that island over there, small fry...
The guy who lives there is named [red]Tingle[white],
but he won't grow up and act his age.
He still dresses like a little kid.
That...is not normal.
Still, from what I hear, he can [red]decipher
[white]maps like nobody's business!
It just goes to show you that you can't
judge a person on appearance alone, fry!


Of course, the thing about this Tingle guy
is that when it comes time to pay his
[red]deciphering fee[white], you'd better be ready to
fork over some serious dough.
[red]Anyone who doesn't have a deep wallet
[white]won't be reading any maps, that's for sure."





"Let me tell you, something, small fry...
The school on that Windfall Island has one
gorgeous teacher!

But the thing is, this gang of four little
hoodlums is always causing trouble for her.
 

Those little delinquents like to cause all
sorts of trouble. They go climbing trees and
hiding behind buildings instead of going to
school... What a bunch of savages.
Somebody's got to scold those scoundrels
and set them straight for the sake of that
poor teacher! You hear me, fry?"





"Word is, they hold an auction every night
over there on Windfall Island.


Every night the people gather in the Hall of
Wealth to amuse themselves by spending a
little money. Ah, the rich!

Auctions may be a race to see who can bid
the highest, but I'll let you in on a little
secret: the key to winning an auction is to
be both patient and bold. I'm serious, fry!
From what I hear, they get some great
things up on that auction block, too.
...Like [red]heart-shaped[white] stuff, among other
things. Maybe that's just a rumor.
You should try it out, small fry.
You might just like it!"





"You see that there volcano that's spewing
out lava like there's no tomorrow? Yeah,
well, they say there's a great [red]treasure
[white]hidden inside that thing.
The thing is, everyone who's ever tried
to get inside has just been blasted away
by the great balls of fire that come
shooting off the top.
If you want to get inside, you ought to go
find the island that's [red]one square north [white]and
[red]four squares west[white] of here. That's where [red]the
power to freeze anything [white]is hidden.
...Or so they say. Maybe it's not true.
But it wouldn't hurt to look, fry!"





"I wouldn't sail through these seas on nights
when [red]the left half of the moon is missing[white]...
You'll regret it if you do, fry!

I'm warning you! It's not my fault if you get
so scared that you can't go to the
bathroom at night anymore!"





"I met a really weird guy on the island due
east of here. He had a pack on his back
huger than any pack I've ever seen.
I mean, it was B-I-G, fry!
He said he was looking for treasure, but
what does he expect to find in a place
like that?

I tell you...the guy is completely obsessed!"





"You should come around these parts on
nights when just a wee bit of the [red]left half
[white]of the moon is missing.

...[wait=30][draw_instant]That's when IT appears, fry![draw_char]"





"You've seen those weird [red]rings of light [white]that
appear on the seas at night, haven't you?


Yeah, well, those things are a sure sign
that there's treasure in the deeps, fry!


But let me tell you, there are some lights
that don't always shine. Yeah. There are
these special ones that [red]shine like crazy[white],
but only when you open a [red]Treasure Chart[white]!
They say that those mark the spots where
the greatest treasures are hidden!"





"They've got a shop over there on Windfall
island_a nice outdoor shop! Did you know
that, small fry?

And in that shop they've got this really fine
safe that looks to be brimming full with
riches...and they just leave it sitting
outside_day and night!
I tell you, one of these days that thing is
going to get hauled off by a thief!
Mark my words, fry!

Of course, if I were to find a thief in the
act of thieving, I'd stop the perpetrator
right there and catch the rat red-handed!

I'm sure if I did, the owner of that shop
would thank me. Yeah, he'd be happy.


...That would be the honest thing to do!"





"I've done a fish-fortune on you, small fry,
and from what I can tell, it looks like you're
fated to come to this place many times.

And the keys that control that fate are
none other than the lucky items known as
the Triumph Forks! Yeah, they're some sort
of magical utensils!
If you want to learn more about the
Triumph Forks, talk to that guy, [red]Tingle[white]!
That's what the fish-fortune told me!

Now, I know I may only be a fish, but my
fortune-telling is uncannily accurate!
You'd better believe it, small fry!"





"Tell me, small fry... Have you ever caught a
fairy before?


`Cause from what I've been told, when
you've been beaten to a pulp by monsters
and such, and you think that you've finally
met your match...
If you've got a fairy with you then you've
got nothing to worry about. Don't you
wish you had something handy for carrying
fairies around with you, fry?
If you want one, go [red]south[white] from here until
you see a miserable-looking [red]submarine
[white]floating on the sea. Look there!"





"Tell me, small fry, do you have any of them
[red]Golden Feathers[white]?


I hear those things are all the rage with
Rito ladies on [red]Dragon Roost Island[white] these
days. They just go ga-ga over them!

But the thing is, the only way to get a
[red]Golden Feather[white] is to defeat one of those
bird-monsters...or so they say.

Yup! Rito men who have girlfriends sure
have tough lots in life, I tell you!"





"You've seen the boats sailing around here
with the real huge cannons, right, fry?
 

I bet you those things have their hulls
packed with treasure!


Of course, if you don't have a [red]cannon
[white]yourself there's no way you'll ever sink
one of them..."





"Tell me, small fry, have you ever heard of
the fabled set of Triumph Forks?


Well, it's right there, my young fry...
On that island... You know... A chart,
showing you where to find them...

Of course, getting it's the hard part."





"So tell me, small fry, have you heard about
the golden [wait=10]Triumph Forks[wait=10]?
There are such things...

And there's a [red]chart [white]that'll show you where
to find them on that island there.


If you want it, try asking that huge,
grouchy-looking [red]stone watcher[white]!


I doubt you could even budge the thing,
though... You've got skinny arms, fry."





"A famed pictographer lives far to the [red]north
[white]of here on [red]Windfall Island[white].


He's apparently real wise and talented
in the ways of pictography.


He's even said to have [red]legendary
pictographs[white] that he treasures above all
other things. He keeps them hidden away
in a secret safe, or so they say.
By the way, small fry...
What exactly is a pictograph, anyway?!"





"So, tell me, small fry... Have you heard of
the golden set of [wait=10]Triumph Forks[wait=10]?
It's right there, I tell you! A [red]chart[white] that
shows you where they are! In that house!
If you want it, you'd better go in there
and scour the place from floor to ceiling!"





"You ought to come sail these seas [red]on nights
when the right half of the moon is missing[white]...


It'll give you shivers, fry!"





"Tell me, small fry, have you ever heard
of the golden [wait=10]Triumph Forks[wait=10]?
They're there, on that island... Or, at least,
a [red]chart [white]leading to them is there.
Where's it hidden, you ask? Well, for the
answer to that, you'll have to ask a gull."





"Oh, I've got some great information,
small fry! Lucky you!


If you use the [red]treasure[white] that's hidden on
that island there, the thing that vanishes
as soon as you get near it... It won't
vanish anymore! You know...IT!
I'm talking about IT! That thing that
appears [red]on nights when a wee bit of the
right half of the moon is missing[white]!
Don't you know what I'm talking about?! IT!"





"Long ago, there was this huge [red]fairy[white] who
lived to the [red]south of here[white], in [red]the forest
[white]on [red]Outset Island[white].

But now, all that's left is the ruins of the
fairy fountain where she lived...
It's sort of sad...

But to tell you the truth... I hear there
still IS a fairy there. Yup! She's still
alive and kicking down there, fry!"





"Tell me, small fry, have you ever been
caught in one of those cyclones?


The wind [red]deity[white], [red]Cyclos[white], uses those cyclones
to fly across the sea [red]instantaneously[white], or so
I've heard. Could be just a rumor.

Boy, if you had that power, you wouldn't
have to spend so much time sailing back
and forth across the sea all the time.
Wouldn't that be nice, fry?
But let me tell you, there's no way he'll
give up his power easily! You can't get near
the guy, so you'll have to figure out how to
shoot him from a distance.
Don't you have a weapon that can pierce
things from a distance? You know, fffwip?
FFFWIP, I tell you! You get my point, fry?!"





"Listen up, small fry_this is just between
you and me...


On [red]Outset Island[white], buried [red]beneath the black
soil[white]...there's some serious [red]treasure[white].


I know it sounds like I'm trying to pull
your leg, but I'm serious. Try [red]digging[white] there!"





"There's this amazing [red]treasure[white] inside that
freezing ring of ice over there.


But even if you wanted it and tried to get
inside, you'd just be frozen solid as soon
as you approached the shore.

But...if you go [red]four squares north[white] and [red]three
squares west[white], you'll find [red]the power to melt
any ice_no matter how cold[white]!
Search for it, small fry!"





"Just a wee bit [red]north[white] of this island, I've
sometimes seen a [red]merchant[white] of incredible
girth with a monstrous pack on his back.

Now, what could he be doing on that lonely
little isle?


I tell you, there are some strange folk in the
world, fry..."





"Hey, small fry, do you know about the
[red]Nintendo Gallery[white]?


The only way in there is to hit a [red]switch
[white]that's way up high on the [red]Forest Haven[white].


But the only way to do THAT would be to
bribe one of the gulls by putting a little
[red]bait[white] on your head!"





"On the [red]island due east[white] of here lives an
[red]old man[white] who was once a master
swordsman. He's got proof of it, too:
he has a [red]Knight's Crest[white].
Want to know what that thing is, fry?



Well, too bad... I can't go giving away
every secret!"





"I heard that beneath the [red]big-head boulder
[white]on top of the hill here on [red]Outset[white]...


...is where the greatest treasures of all,
the golden Triumph Forks, are buried.


But actually, fry, I must have misheard
or something...


`Cause this one guy told me that what was
actually buried beneath that weird rock
was a chart to this shard of something
called a [red]Triforce[white]. Whoever heard of that?
That's crazy! There's a big difference
between \"Triumph Forks\" and \"Triforce\"!
I mean, I think someone intentionally
buried something misleading there."





"Small fry, there's a [red]real heavy stone head
[white]blocking a cave on that island. Don't you
wonder what's behind it? Don't you want to
get in there?
Heh heh! Let me tell you a great secret!



If you go [red]north four squares[white] and [red]east three
squares[white] to [red]Fire Mountain[white], you'll find an
item that gives you [red]the strength to easily
lift anything[white], no matter how heavy it is.
With that thing, you could lift that stone
and toss it out of your way as if it were
light as a feather."





"I tell you, lately no one around these waters
has seen the beautiful [red]fairy [white]who [red]bestows
magic power[white]. She used to live here, fry.

All anyone ever sees anymore are the
[red]Big Octos[white] that have been appearing
lately. Maybe they scared her off...
Oh no! I sure hope...they didn't eat her!"





"[red]Northeast[white] of here is the [red]Forest Haven[white]...
They say a truly unique kind of [red]firefly[white]
is indigenous to that place.
You heard of it, small fry?
It emits bursts of light in [red]seven colors[white]!
Supposedly it's as beautiful as a rainbow!


If you want to capture one though, you'd
best have a [red]bottle[white] to keep it in."





"Lemme ask you something, fry...
Have you been using [r] to make your boat
[red]jump[white]? Well? Have you?

...Of course, going out to sea just to jump
around would be real dumb, if you ask me.


Anyway, what you can do is tilt [left_arrow][control_stick_left_right][right_arrow] to
move your tiller just as you land...
That's how you make a sharp turn. If you
didn't know that, why don't you try it out?"





"Have you seen it, small fry?
[wait=20]...The [red]Ghost Ship[white]?


`Cause it's real. It's even been seen here,
in these very waters...


[red]On nights when the crescent moon faces
down[white]... That's when horror rises..."





"[cyan]Come visit my fountain again when you
have met that individual...when the time
has come for you to face new challenges.

At that time, I shall show you my true self."





"[cyan]Tee hee hee!
Greetings, child!"





"[cyan]Tee hee hee!
It seems the door to your fate has already
swung open, has it not?"





"[cyan]I am the queen of the fairy world.



What is the matter?
Does that not surprise you, [wait=10]child?"





"I'll buy up to [red][golden_feather_count][white]."





"You want to sell your [red]Golden Feathers[white]?

Crests[white], I'll buy them for [red]5 Rupees each[white]!"

"I'll pay up to [red]10 Rupees[white] for a
[red]Knight's Crest[white]!"





"These things have been all the rage with
[red]monsters[white] lately! They sell like hotcakes.
Like hotcakes, I tell you!

I'm laughing my way all the way to the
bank! Laughing at monsters!"





"Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!"





"Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!"
