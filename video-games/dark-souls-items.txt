With such dangers, the crest can do more harm than good in the hands of the uninitiated. Key to the hanging cage in Sen's Fortress.

The Archive Tower, once a trove of precious tomes and letters, became a prison after the onset of Seath's madness. The serpent men who guard the prison know not the value of what they hide.

In the wintery painted world, there is a structure resembling an old cathedral;
its annex serves as a type of storehouse. Key to the dungeon of the Undead Asylum to the North.

But this Chosen Undead knows not what this pilgrimage has in store. Key to the iron bars on the east side of the second floor of the North Undead Asylum.

The victims now roam the ruins as ghosts. Key opening the door from the lower Undead Burg to the Depths.

Those banished from the Undead Burg eke out their existence in the Depths, a damp lair with no trace of sunlight. Nearly half of the Depths form a perilous flooded labyrinth.

Sorcery catalyst used by sorcerers of Vinheim Dragon School.

Equip catalyst to use sorceries.
Attune sorceries from a scroll at a bonfire.
Most sorceries have limited no. of uses.

Catalyst belonging to Beatrice, the rogue witch. Contrasts with Vinheim catalysts.

This ancient catalyst shows signs of being used for age-old sorceries. It has passed the hands of many generations to get here.

Catalyst of the banishment sorcerers who flooded New Londo to seal off away the Darkwraiths and the Kings who fell to Dark.
In contrast to other catalysts, the metal catalyst qualifies as a weapon, as it inflicts physical damage, however small.

Catalyst of Big Hat Logan, the great sorcerer and seeker of knowledge.
Originally the same catalyst employed by the Vinheim sorcerers, only terribly strengthened over time due to Logan's use. Very powerful when used by one of superior intelligence.

Catalyst born from the soul of the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who watches over the abandoned city of Gods, Anor Londo.
Gwyndolin is Gwyn's lastborn and a legitimate god, but he is also a Moon sorcerer, and this wand is boosted by faith, not intelligence.

Sorcery catalyst of lost land of Oolacile.
Formed by enchanted whitebark branches.

The whitebark boosts sorcery adjustment, but the sorceries of this lost land are gentle and not affected by intelligence.

Catalyst imbued in terrifying crystal magic.
Used by Logan after his fixation on Seath.

Makes all sorceries incredibly powerful, but demands extremely high intelligence from its wielder, and halves sorcery usages.

Demon catalyst formed from Izalith molten rock. Can be used as fire weapon.
The Demon Firesage was the first demon, and the last master of the original fire arts, before the Witch of Izalith was engulfed by Chaos, creating pyromancy.

Catalyst of the Witch of Izalith of long ago, when her daughters were still flame witches, before they were engulfed by the Chaos Flame.
Before the birth of pyromancy, their wands were mediums for sorcery, but knowledge of this flame sorcery has long since vanished.
