Hi?
; )
Ooh, I
have to
disagree
; )
Temmie,
are you
okay?
; )
* Since you flexed at me,
  I've been thinking of a
  lot of things ; )
* Like...
* Flexing ; )
* And flexing ; )
* You came all this way to
  see me flex ; )
* This really says something
  about you ; )
* I... I'm sc-scared... ; )
* Ghosts aren't real, right?
* ; )
* What? They are real?
* Oh nooooooo ; )
* First ghosts, are real, now
  anime's real ; )
* All my nightmares are true ; )
Alphys
* W-well, of course
  I'm going to go
  out and...
* Um...
* No, I should be
  honest!!
* I'm gonna stay inside
  and watch anime like
  a total loser!
* (Oh My God?)
* (Frisk. Please.)
* (Help me explain what
  anime is to Asgore.)
* Y-you see, it's
  like a cartoon,
  but...
* H-hold on, uh...
* I think I have
  some on my phone.
* Here, l-look at
  this!
* ...
*...Oh, uh...
* Um... that's the...
* That's the wrong...
* Uh, nevermind.
* Eheheh... yeah!
* It sure is!
* Psst...
* F-Frisk.
* Um, you've gotta
  tell me.
* D... do you think
  Asgore and Toriel
  are...?
* Uh, ever gonna get
  back together?
* Error...
* Y-yeah!!!
* Yeah, that's what
  I hope, too.
* Just think about how
  cute they must have
  been together.
* It's quickly becoming
  my number one ship
  of all time.
* Tori and Gorey...
* My...
* My old boss and
  his ex-wife.
* ... uh, that sounds
  a lot less cool
  all of a sudden.
* ... yeah, that's what
  I thought.
* A woman can dream
  though, right?
* And write fanfiction.
* A LOT of fanfiction.
* Y-yeah, Asgore.
* Don't break Undyne's
  heart.
* That's my job.
* Wow... it's e-even
  better than on TV.
* WAY better!
* Better than I ever
  imagined!
D-don't do that.
Uh.... OK?
   
Uhhh, sorry!
I'm still getting
dressed!
H-how do I look?
My friend helped me
pick out this
dress.
She's got a great
sense of...
Um, anyway!
Let's do this thing!
H-h-hey, w-w-wait!
Actually, we still
can't start the
date yet!!!
Umm, I've gotta give
you items to raise
your affection
statistic, first!
That'll increase the
chance of a successful
outcome to the
date!
Right...?
Anyway, d-don't worry!
I'm prepared!
I-I've been
stockpiling gifts
in anticipation
for a date like this!
F-first, I've got...
Some metal armor
polish!
Um, maybe you can't
use that.
But!!!
I also brought some
waterproof cream for
your scales!
Your, uh...
Scales...
Uh, well, how about...
This magical spear
repair kit, that I...
Um...
Hey, let's forget
about the items!
Let's just start
the date!
Yeah!!!
Let's, uh, date!
... uh...
Do you... like...
Anime...?
H-hey!
Me too!!
Oh.
Hey!
Let's!!
Go somewhere!!!
But where's a good
place to go on
a date...?
...
I've got it!!!
Let's go to the
garbage dump!!!
Here we are!
This is where Undyne
and I come all
the time...
We find all sorts
of great stuff
here.
Heh, she's
really...
Uh...
Oh no.
That's her over
there.
I c-can't let her
see me on a date
with you!
Because, uh...
Well...
Oh no, here she
comes!!
Oh my god...
W... well, I guess
it's obvious, huh?
I... uh...
I really like her.
I mean, more than
I like other people!
I'm sorry.
I j-just figured,
y-you know...
It'd be f-fun to
go on like, a cute,
kind of...
Pretend date with you?
T-to make you feel
better?
Well, it sounds even
worse when I put it
like that.
I'm sorry.
I messed up again.
Undyne's the person I...
Um... really want to
go on a date with.
But, I mean...
She's way out of
my league.
N-not that you
aren't, um, cool!
B-but... Undyne...
She's so confident...
And strong...
And funny...
And I'm just a
nobody.
A fraud.
I'm the royal
scientist, but...
All I've ever done
is hurt people.
I've told her so
many lies, she thinks
I'm...
She thinks I'm a
lot cooler than I
actually am.
If she gets close
to me, she'll...
She'll find out the
truth about me.
What should I do?
The truth...?
But if I tell her
that, she'll hate
me.
Isn't it better
this way?
To live a lie where
both people are
happy...
Or a truth where
neither of us
are?
They say "be
yourself."
But I don't
really like who
"myself" is.
I'd rather just
be whatever makes
people like me.
Eheheh...
No, you're right.
Every day I'm
scared...
Scared what will
happen if people
learn the truth
on their own.
They'll all get
hurt because of
me...
But how can I
tell UNDYNE the
tr... truth?
I d-don't have the
confidence...
I'm going to mess
it up!
How can I
practice!?
Yeah... yeah, you're
right!
I've come this far,
I c-can't tell
her now!
Sh-she'd be really
hurt if she found
out, right?
S-so it'll just
be, uh, a little
secret!
What people don't
know can't hurt
them!!
Th-thank God I've
got an honest
friend like you!!
B... but what if she
finds out on her
own, somehow?
Or if I ever
m-mess up...
Sh-she'd find out
the truth, and...
Pr-probably be even
more hurt than if
I told her myself.
N-not to mention,
l-lying so far...
h... has...
Been really
stressful, and scary.
I think I'm going
to have to tell
her the truth.
B-but how!?
I... I don't have
the confidence...
How am I supposed
to practice
something like that!?
R... roleplay?
... That actually
sounds kind of
fun!
OK, which one of
us will be Undyne?
Oh. Right.
Obviously.
Ehehe.
Ahem.
H-hi Undyne...
H-how are you doing
today?
Ha! Ha!
Glad to hear it!!
Uhhh, so I'd like
to, um, talk to
you about
something.
Th... thanks!
You say that to me
a lot, and I
never know what
to say!!
But I know, you just,
mean it platonically,
because we're just
friends!
Eheheh!!!
Umm, you see...
I... I...
I... I h-haven't been
exactly truthful
w-w-with you...
Y... you see, I... I...
Oh, forget it!
Undyne!!!
I... I want to
tell you how I
feel!
Y-you're so brave,
a-and s-strong...
A-and nice...
Y-you always listen
t-to me when I talk
about n-n-nerdy
stuff...
Y-you always d-d-do
your best to m-make
me f-f-feel
special...
L-like t-telling me
that y-you'll b-beat
up anyone that
g-gets in my way...
WH-WHAT!?
UNDYNE WOULD NEVER,
UH....
...
I kiss her back...
S... softly...
I... l-look gently
into her eyes...
UNDYNE!!!
I CAN'T TAKE THIS
ANY LONGER!!!
I'M MADLY IN LOVE
WITH YOU!!!
HOLD ME, UNDYNE!!
HOLD ME!!!
I START HOLLERING!!
UNDYNE!!!!
I LOVE YOU!!!
UNDYNE!!!
KISS ME AGAIN,
UNDYNE!!!
M-m-me?
Undyne???
Uh, uh, uh, uh,
ok!
I'll say what I
think she'd say,
and you... ummm....
You show me what
I'm supposed to do!
*ahem*
Ngahhhh!!!
Hey, Alphys!
You look cute
today!
Which I say often!
But platonically
because I would
NEVER like you.
Talk, to you?
Hmmm...
I guess so.
I often seem
excited to listen
to you for some
reason.
I will make intent
eye contact with you
so you sweat while
you talk.
So, what is it?
What!?
A... alphys!?
What's gotten into
you!?
H-hotbaby!?
How dare you call
me that!?
First off, I'm a
baby KNIGHT!
Captain of the
babies!!!
Treat my position
with respect, or I
will strike you
down!
Uh, now pretend
I'm suplexing a
boulder for no
reason.
Um! Anyway!
What do you
want to say,
Alphys!?
What!?
So you've been
lying to me the
whole time...
Alphys!!!
I can't believe you!
You w-worthless
slime!
How could you
betray our
friendship!!
After how much I
trusted you!!!
WH-WHAT!?
I WOULD NEVER...
Alphys!
What are you
d-doing!
I s-say, pushing
you away from
me...
You sh-shouldn't
k-kiss me...!!
B-but, y-you're so
good at it...
B-b-b-because of what
you learned from
th-those d-d-dating
video games...
I....
I c-c-can't help but
k-k-kiss you back...
ALPHYS!
I'LL NEVER LOVE YOU!
NEVER WILL YOU FEEL
MY PASSIONATE
EMBRACE!!!
I, UNDYNE, WILL
NEVER KISS YOU
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL
LIPS!!!
NGAHHHH!!!
NGAHHH!!!!
I'M UNDYNE AND I'M
PILING ON THE
SMOOCHES!!!
U... Undyne!
I... was... just...
UHHH, YES!
I mean, UHHH NO!
I mean, we were,
 but
I mean, actually we
were only romantically
roleplaying as you!
I MEAN!!!
I mean...
Undyne...
I...
I've been lying to
you!
About... well...
Everything!
I told you that
 seaweed was like...
scientifically
important...
Really, I just...
I just use it to
make ice cream!
And those human
history books I
keep reading...
Those are just
dorky comic books!
And the history
movies...
those...
Those are just, uh,
anime!
They aren't real!
And that time I
told you I was
busy with work on
the phone... I...
Was just eating
frozen yogurt in
my pajamas!
That time I...
I... I just wanted to
impress you!
I just wanted you
to think I was
smart and cool.
That I wasn't
some...
nerdy loser.
Undyne, I...
I really think you're
neat, OK...
Undyne...
You...
Y-you're gonna train
me...?
 
 
    U-Undyne...
 
 
    I'll do my
    best...!
OH! OH! I KNOW
THIS ONE!!!
IT'S SNAIL ICE
CREAM!!!!!!!!
IN THE FOURTH
CHAPTER EVERYONE
GOES TO THE
BEACH!!!
AND SHE BUYS
ICE CREAM FOR
ALL OF HER
FRIENDS!!!!
BUT IT'S SNAIL
FLAVOR AND SHE'S
THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS IT!!!!!!
IT'S ONE OF MY
FAVORITE PARTS
OF THE GAME
BECAUSE
IT'S ACTUALLY A
VERY POWERFUL
message about
friendship and...
H-hey, I've done
research about this!
There are alternate
universes out there!
S-someday, maybe, I
could meet them...
You hate
me,
don't
you...?
I've got
to keep
lying...
All I do
is hurt
people.
 No, that's not true!
 My friends like me!
 And I like you,
 too!
* Th-that last
  question...
* He wasn't s-supposed
  to ask that one...
* I... I just need
  a moment.
* S... Sorry about
  that!
* L-let's k-keep
  going!
* S-so you're about
  to meet ASGORE,
  h-huh?
* You must be...
* Y-you must be...
* Pr... pretty
  excited about all
  that, huh?
* You'll f-f-finally...
* You'll finally get
  to go home!
* W...
* Wait!
* I mean, um...
* I...
* I was just going
  to...
* ...um...
* Say goodbye, and...
* I can't take
  this anymore.
* I...
* I lied to you.
* A human SOUL isn't
  strong enough to
  cross the barrier alone.
* It takes at least
  a human soul...
* And a monster
  soul.
* ...
* If you want to
  go home...
* You'll have to
  take his soul.
* You'll have to
  kill ASGORE.
* I'm sorry.
* I... I managed to open
  the lock!
* Are you two...
* Oh my god.
* Mettaton!
* Mettaton, are you...
* H... hey...
* D... don't worry
  about it...
* I can always...
* I can always build
  a different robot!
* ...
* Why don't you go
  on ahead?
* ... thank GOD, it's just
  the batteries.
* Mettaton, if you were
  gone, I would have...
* I would have...
* ...
* I m-mean, h-hey, it's
  n-no problem, you
  know?
* He's just a robot, if
  you messed it up, I
  c-could always...
* J-just build another.
* Why don't you go
  on ahead?
* H-hey!!!
* Wh-wh-what's going on!?
* Th-th-the door just
  locked itself!
* Oh.
* My god.
* I didn't expect you
  to show up so
  soon!
* I haven't showered, I'm
  barely dressed, it's
  all messy, and...
* Ummm...
* H-h-hiya!
* I'm Dr. Alphys.
* I'm ASGORE's royal
  scientist!
* B-b-but, ahhhh,
  I'm not one of
  the "bad guys"!
* Actually, since you
  stepped out of the
  RUINS, I've, um...
* ... been "observing"
  your journey through
  my console.
* Your fights...
* Your friendships...
* Everything!
* I was originally
  going to stop
  you, but...
* Watching someone on
  a screen really makes
  you root for them.
* Watching you, I felt
  like... like I was
  seeing an old friend.
* S-so, ahhh, now I
  want to help you!
* Using my knowledge,
  I can easily guide
  you through Hotland!
* I know a way right
  to ASGORE's castle,
  no problem!
* Well, actually, umm,
  there's just a
  tiny issue.
* A long time ago, I
  made a robot named
  Mettaton.
* Originally, I built
  him to be an
  entertainment robot.
* Uh, you know, like
  a robotic TV star
  or something.
* Anyway, recently I
  decided to make him
  more useful.
* You know, just some
  small practical
  adjustments.
* Like, um...
* Anti... anti-human
  combat features?
* Of c-course, when I
  saw you coming, I
  immediately decided...
* I have to remove
  those features!
* Unfortunately, I may
  have made a teensy
  mistake while doing so.
* And, um...
* Now he's an unstoppable
  killing machine with a
  thirst for human blood?
* Ehehehehe...
* Heh.
* But, ummm, hopefully
  we won't run into
  him!
* Did you hear
  something?
* Well that was
  certainly something.
* Wait, wait!
* Let me give you my
  ph-phone number!
* Th-then... m-maybe...
* If you need help,
  I could...
* Wh... where'd you get
  that phone!?
* It's ANCIENT!
* It doesn't even have
  texting.
* W-wait a second,
  please!
* Here, I upgraded it
  for you!
* It can do texting,
  items, it's got a
  key chain...
* I even signed you up
  for the underground's
  No. 1 social network!
* Now we're officially
  friends!
* Ehehehe!
* Heheh...
* Heh...
* I'm going to the
  bathroom.
* (O-oh n-no, is that another
  letter...?)
* (I don't want to open it...)
* (C-can't I just slide it
  back out...?)
* (N... no... I can't keep doing
  this.)
* (I'll read this one.)
* (Um...)
* (I-it's shut k-kind of
  strongly, isn't it?)
* (Wait a second...)
* Hey, if this is a
  joke, it's...
* Oh My God?
* Did YOU write this
  letter?
* It wasn't signed, so,
  I had no idea who
  could have...
* Oh my god.
* Oh no.
* That's adorable...
* And I h-had no idea
  you, um, wrote that way!
* It's surprising, too...
* After all the gross
  stuff I did...
* I don't really deserve
  to be forgiven.
* Much less, um...
* This?
* And so passionately,
  too.
* You know what, okay!
* I'll do it!
* It's the least I can
  do to make it up
  to you!
* Y-yeah!
* Let's go on a date!
* Hey, Undyne!!
* Wait up!!
* W-we were so
  worried...!
* It felt like you
  were out forever!
* Ehehe...
* Ehehehe...
* AHA! AHAHAH!
* HA!! HA!!!
* Oh, Toriel.
* You have NO idea.
* (O-oh, that sounds
  REALLY good.)
* (On second thought,
  maybe I'll o-order
  a pizza.)
* I-I'll see if I
  can manage to find
  any like that, Undyne.
* But they CAN'T fly.
* On second thought,
  maybe I WON'T write
  fanfic of real people.
* I mean, isn't real life
  already the greatest
  fanfiction of all?
* Uh, don't tell
  anyone I said that.
* Cause I'm gonna
  post it online!
* I sure am excited
  to finally use the
  human internet.
* I bet they have all
  sorts of things Undyne
  and I can watch!
* Of course, Undyne!
* What do you think
  we've been fighting
  for all along?
* Jinx!
* I knew you were
  gonna make that joke!
* Well...
* I...
* TORIEL!?!?!
* Hey Frisk, why
  don't you go look
  for Mettaton?
* He was here for
  a while, too...
* But he said he
  had to go somewhere.
* Hey!
* Stop!!!
* I got you guys some
  food, okay!?
* Sorry about that...
* They get kind of sassy
  when they don't get
  fed on time.
* Um!!
* I think they smelled
  the potato chips you
  had, and...
* Anyway!
* The power went out,
  and I've been trying
  to turn it back on!
* But it seems like you
  were one step ahead
  of me.
* This was probably just
  a big inconvenience
  for you...
* B-but I appreciate
  that you came here
  to back me up!
* As I said, I was
  afraid I might...
* Not come back...
* But that's not because
  of these guys or
  anything!
* I was just worried I
  would be too afraid...
* To tell the truth...
* That I might run away,
  or do something...
* Cowardly.
* Uh... I...
* I suppose I owe you
  an explanation.
* As you probably know,
  ASGORE asked me to study
  the nature of SOULs.
* During my research, I
  isolated a power I
  called "determination."
* I injected it into dying
  monsters so their SOULs
  would last after death.
* But the experiment
  failed.
* You see, unlike humans',
  monsters' bodies don't
  have enough...
* Physical matter to take
  those concentrations
  of "determination."
* Their bodies started to
  melt, and lost what
  physicality they had.
* Pretty soon, all of the
  test subjects had melted
  together into...
* Those.
* Seeing them like this,
  I knew...
* I couldn't tell their
  families about it.
* I couldn't tell anyone
  about it.
* No matter how much
  everyone was asking me.
* And I was too afraid to
  do any more work,
  knowing...
* ... everything I'd done
  so far had been such
  a horrific failure.
* ... but now.
* Now, I've changed my
  mind about all this.
* I'm going to tell
  everyone what I've done.
* It's going to be hard.
* Being honest...
* Believing in myself...
* I'm sure there will be
  times where I'll
  struggle.
* I'm sure there will be
  times where I screw
  up again.
* But knowing, deep down,
  that I have friends
  to fall back on...
* I know it'll be a
  lot easier to stand
  on my own.
* Thank you.
* Come on, guys.
* It's time for everyone
  to go home.
H-hey!
Nobody
hurt
each
other!!
Uh,
h-h-hi!
(THERE'S
TWO OF
THEM???)
Y-yeah, ASGORE!!
Undyne's totally
right about that
fish thing!
S-sometimes you've
just got to, uh...
S-stop going after
furry boss monsters
and, uh...
J-just get to know
a really cute
fish...?
It's a metaphor.
He's
right.
LET'S
DO
IT.
Uhh, right!
S-sorry, I got a
little carried
away there.
H-hey, that
reminds me.
Papyrus...
YOU called
everyone here,
right?
Well, besides,
uh, her.
Uh, anyway...
If I got here
before you...
How did you know
how to call
everybody?
A tiny...
flower?
Technically, it's
impossible for you
to beat him...
B-but...
Somehow, I know
you can do it!!

ALPHYS updated status. 
* OH MY GOD HOW DID THAT EVEN
  END UP WORKING LMAO
Alphys (call)
    
* Um...
* I noticed you've been
  kind of quiet...
* Are you w-worried
  about meeting ASGORE...?
* ...
* W-well, don't worry,
  okay?
* Th-the king is a
  really nice guy...
* I'm sure you can
  talk to him, and...
* W-with your human
  soul, you can pass
  through the barrier!
* S-so no worrying, OK?
* J-just forget about it
  and smile.
* L-looks like you
  beat him!
* Y-you did a really
  great job out there.
* What?
* Oh no, I mean...
* You were the one
  doing everything cool!
* I just wrote some
  silly programs for
  your phone.
* ... umm, h-hey, this
  might sound strange,
  but...
* ... c-can I tell
  you something?
* ...
* B-before I met you,
  I d-didn't really...
* I didn't really
  like myself very
  much.
* For a long time,
  I f-felt like a
   total screw-up.
* L-like I couldn't
  do a-anything
  w-without...
* W-without ending up
  letting everyone
  down.
* B-but...!
* Guiding you has
  made me feel...
* A lot better about
  myself.
* So... thanks for
  letting me help
  you.
* Uhhh, anyway, we're
  almost to the CORE.
* It's just past
  MTT Resort.
* Come on!
* Let's finish this!
* Hey!
* This um, doesn't have
  anything to do with
  guiding you... but...
* Uhh, hey, would you want
  to watch a human TV
  show together???
* Sometime???
* It's called, um,
  M...Mew Mew Kissy
  Cutie...
* R-really!?
* It's so good!
* It's um, my favorite
  show!
* It's all about this
  human girl named Mew Mew
  who has cat ears!
* Which humans don't have!
* S-so she's all
  sensitive about them!
* But like...
* Eventually!
* She realizes that her
  ears don't matter!
* That her friends like
  her despite the ears!
* It's really moving!
* Whoops, spoilers
* Also, this sounds
  weird, but she has
  the power!
* To control the minds
  of anyone she kisses!
* She kisses people and
  controls them to fix
  her problems!!
* They don't remember
  anything after the
  kiss I mean!!
* BUT IF SHE MISSES
  THE KISS!!!
* THEN!!
* Then, uh, and, uh,
  also I mean, of course
* Eventually, she
  realizes that
  controlling people
* OKAY WELL I almost
  spoiled the whole
  show, but
* Uhhh, I think you'd
  really like it!!!
* We should watch it!
* After you get through
  all this!
* Um! Well!
* That's okay!
* Just thought I'd!!
* Ask!!!
* B-but I think you'd
  really like it!!
* If you gave it a
  chance!!
* U-uhhh...
* (Oh my god, help...)
* I'd like to order a...
* Um...
* A pizza...?
* With, uhh...
* The toppings are, uh...
* I have them copied, I'll
  just paste them to you.
* ...
* H-hey, Undyne, are
  you okay...?
* U... uh, okay!
* Man, she's tsundere...
* Um, hi...
* S-sorry, I hate
  talking on the
  phone.
* I don't really know
  what to say.
* Hey, why didn't you
  tell me the queen
  was so cute?
* Uh, I mean, uh...
* Mettaton's doing OK!
* And! Um!
* I'm trying to figure
  a way for us to
  get out of here!
* B-but I kinda have
  no idea what I'm
  doing.
* I'll figure it out
  eventually, though.
* The queen is a lot
  different from
  ASGORE...
* She actually checks to
  see if I'm doing
  anything.
* She's really turned
  this whole place
  around!
* Oh!
* Hey!
* Wait a second!
* Hey! TORIEL!
* Do you wanna talk
  to...?
* Well, she says she's
  busy.
* B-but, if you want
  to, call and talk
  to her any time.
* G-good...
* Good...
* Hey, why do I
  have to be the one
  to hang up?
* Eheheh...
* I hate goodbyes...
* Um, we'll see you
  again someday!
* H... hey.
* So... you're the one
  who killed all my
  friends.
* I just called to tell
  you.
* I hate you.
* Yet... strangely...
* It's because of you,
  that...
* That I was forced to
  become a better
  person.
* When I first saw you
  hurting people...
* I just sat there.
* Watching you.
* I felt so guilty knowing
  I hadn't do anything
  to stop you.
* I felt like all I
  do was...
* Was hope you would
  destroy me, too.
* But when Undyne called,
  with crazed desperation
  in her voice...
* I...
* I realized I had to do
  something.
* Even if it meant
  everybody would...
* Have to learn the
  truth about me.
* It's strange.
* You know?
* Even after all the
  bad things I did.
* People treated me like
  a hero.
* And then they...
* Asked me to run
  everything.
* So I'm trying my
  best, here.
* I think I have some
  good policies, but,
  y-you know...
* Talking to people
  still makes me
  nervous.
* I'm no ASGORE,
  you know?
* God...
* I miss everyone.
* Now that they're
  gone, it...
* It feels so clear what
  I should have done.
* What I should have
  said.
* Undyne...
* Asgore...
* Mettaton...
* At least Sans is
  still here.
* He's...
* He's a good guy.
* And with him around...
* I...
* Sigh.
* You know.
* Just daydreaming here.
* But...
* I really should have
  killed you when I
  had the chance.
H-hey!!
Th-this seems bad,
but don't worry!!
Th-there's one last
thing I installed
on your phone...!
You see that 
yellow button...?
Go to this phone's
[[ACT]] menu and
press it!!!
Now press [Z]!!!
U..uh... I can't see
what's going on in
there, but...
D-d-don't give up,
okay!?
Th... there's o-one
l-l-last way to beat
Mettaton...
It's... um... it's...
This is a work in-
progress, so don't
judge it too hard...
But, you know how
Mettaton always faces
f-f-forward?
That's because
there's a switch
on his backside.
S-s-so if y-y-you
c-c-can turn him
around... um...
And, umm... press
th-th-th-the
switch...
He'll be... um...
He'll be...
Vulnerable.
Well, g-g-gotta go!
* Wh-what!?
* Wh-why aren't you
  m-m-moving?
* N-no...!
* I must not have
  added enough fuel!
* D-darnit...
* I'm sorry...
* Even when it's
  something like
  this, I...
* I still...!
* I still...
* What?
* Wh...
* What are you...
* H-hey, it's kind of
  dark in there, isn't
  it?
* Don't worry!
* I'll hack into the
  light system and
  brighten it up!
* Oh no.
* W-wait a second!!!
* Couldn't you make
  a...
* Couldn't you use
  a...
* Couldn't you make
  a substitution in
  the recipe?!
    
* Uhh, what if
  someone's...
* Vegan?
    
* Uh well I mean
* Oh no!!!
* There's not enough
  time to climb up!
* F-f-fortunately, I
  might have a plan!
* When I was upgrading
  your phone, I added
  a few... features.
* You see that huge
  button that says...
* "JETPACK"?
* Watch this!
* There!
* You should have
  just enough fuel to
  reach the top!
* Now, get up
  there!!!
* Wow!
* We... we did it!!
* We... we really did
  it!!!
* Great job out
  there, team!
* W-well, uh, anyway,
  let's keep heading
  forward!!!
    
* U-um...
* I guess we...
* ... did it?
*    
* Watch out!!
* I'll save you!!
* I'm hacking into the
  firewall right now!
   
* That's right!
* Come on, Mettaton,
  give up already!
* You'll never be
  able to defeat
  us...
* Not as long as
  we work together!
* Your puzzle's over..
* Now go home and
  leave us alone!
* Flames, deactivate!!
* ... huh?
* Wh-wh-what?
* TH-THAT puzzle?
* I mean, uhh...
* Great job!
* We've got him on
  the ropes, now!
* Okay, I'm back!
* A-another dark room,
  huh?
* M-my hacking skills
  have got things
  covered!
* Are you serious?
* D-don't worry!
* I installed a
  bomb-defusing program
  on your phone!
* Use the 'defuse' option
  when the bomb is in the
  DEFUSE ZONE!
* N-now, go get 'em!
* That's b-because!!!
* While you were
  monologuing... I...!!!
* I f... fix...
* Um... I ch-change...
* Yeah!
* That's what I did!
* W-wow...
* W-we really showed
  him, huh?
* H-hey, I know I was
  kind of weird at
  first...
* But I really think
  I'm getting more...
* Uh, more...
* M-more confident about
  guiding you!
* S-so don't worry
  about that b-big
  d-dumb robot...
* I-I'll protect you
  from him!
* A-and if it really
  c-came down to it,
  we could just t-turn...
* Um, nevermind.
* Later!
* B-boy...
* That was close, huh?
* I guess a little
  closer than I would
  have liked.
* I should have given
  you better directions...
* A-and there j-just
  w-wasn't enough
  time...
* W-well!
* That's Mettaton's fault,
  not mine!
* I c-can't second
  guess myself now.
* I'm f-finally starting
  to f-feel confident
  about g-guiding you.
* I'll protect you from
  that mean old robot,
  n-no matter what!
* If I have to,
  I'll even t-turn...
* We're over halfway
  to the core!
* Let's go!
* Error.
* Great job!
* Keep heading around the
  room!
* Try to go for the
  one in the bottom-
  left next!
* Try to go for the
  one in the top-
  right next!
* Great job!
* Head to the left
  next!
* Great job!
* Head to the right
  next!
* You couldn't even
  get one bomb...!?
* Error,
* Great job!
* Head for the center!
* There's one left there!
* Great job!
* Head for the center!
* I'm using, uh, EM fields
  to trap the glass of
  water there!
* Great job!
* There's only one left
  in the bottom-right!
* Great job!
* There's only one left
  at the top!
* Great job!
* There's only one left
  at the top-right!
* Great job!
* There's only one left
  at the bottom-left!
* It's... it's...
* M... more lasers...
* Okay, I...
* I won't mess around
  this time.
* I'll just deactivate
  the lasers and let
  you through.
* They're...
* They're not turning
  off...
* I can't turn them
  off, I...
* I-i-it's okay!
* I have this under
  control!
* I'm going to turn
  off the p-power for
  that whole node.
* Then you can walk
  across.
* Okay, go!
* H... huh?
* I... I guess this
  was the right way.
* W-WAIT!
* STOP!
* Th-the power...
* It's turning itself
  back on.
* D-damn it...
* Th-this isn't supposed
  to...
* I'm gonna turn
  it off again.
* When it turns off,
  move a little, and
  then STOP.
* OK?
* Y-you won't get
  h-h-hurt.
* Oh my god, are
  you okay!?
* I-I c-couldn't keep
  the power off
  long enough...
* No, no, we've
  got this, it's just
  a little further!
* S-see?
* I've got everything
  under control.
* Everything's under
  control!
* Oh my god, are
  you okay?
* I... I'm sorry, I
  gave you the
  wrong order.
* E-everything's fine,
  okay?
* L-let's just keep
  heading to the
  right.
* Oh my god...
* Are you hurt?
* I... I'm so sorry,
  I... I gave you
  the wrong order.
* Everything's going
  to be fine, okay?
* H-hey, why don't
  you try to use
  the elevator first?
* H-hey, why don't
  you try to go
  to the right first?
* Okay, you should
  be able to make
  it through here...
* W-watch out!
* Th-that was close...
* Wh... why are there
  so many monsters
  here?
* I mean...
* It's no problem,
  r-r-right?
* W-w-we've just got
  to keep heading
  forward!
* Sorry, I... I...
* I thought that...
* Let's try the
  right path instead.
* A-are you okay?
* Why didn't you
  head to the
  right...?
* C-C'mon...
* Y-you trust me,
  d-don't you?
* Huh?
* Who are they?
* N-nobody else is
  s-supposed to be
  here...
* Oh well!
* We can't worry
  about that now!
* OK!
* Now press the third
  one!!!
* .............
* .............
* H-h-hey!
* Looks like you!!! 
* Only needed to press!
* Two of them!!!
    
* H-h-hey!
* You did it!
* I was worried I
  messed it up
  there...
* But I guess we
  make a pretty good
  team!
* What?
* The elevator should
  be working...
* W-well then!
* Go to the right
  and keep heading up!
* W-well then!
* Let's go to the
  left!
* H-hey, watch out!
* You're going to get
  really hurt!
* I can't watch this.
* I'm disabling the
  lasers.
* Th... there.
* Be careful, okay?
* I-I'm sorry, it's
  m-my fault you
  got hurt.
* I didn't explain the
  lasers well enough,
  and..
* If I hadn't...
* If I hadn't...
* Um, delayed using
  my hacking skills,
  I mean...
* ... sorry.
* I didn't explain the
  lasers well enough,
  and...
* O-oh, there's no
  time for this now!
* Sorry.
* OK!
* Y-you should...
* You should...
* Head to the...
* Head to the...
* I... I...
* I don't know?
* This doesn't look
  like my map
  at all...
* I'm sorry...
* I... I...
* I have to go.
* W-wait!
* No, I think you
  should h-head up!
* A crossroads...
* Uhh...
* Uhhh...
* Tr...
* Try heading to the
  right!
* Looks like you can't
  proceed until you
  hit the switch.
* B-but, those lasers
  will activate when
  you do.
* Ummm...
* Looks like they'll
  come in this order:
* Orange. Orange. Blue.
* G-got it?
* Move until the
  third one!
* Alright, now just
  keep heading
  up!
* ...
* That pit...
* Isn't on my map.
* Forget it!
* Let's try the
  left side!
* H-hey, aren't
  you gonna use
  the elevator?
* I guess you can
  go this way!
* If there wasn't
  a huge pit in
  the way...?
* Wh... where'd this
  pit come from?
* You should be able
  to walk across
  here...
* Ready?
* This is it!
* Take the elevator
  up to the top
  of the CORE!
* Hi, Alphys here!
* This room is like
  the room we saw
  before.
* There are two puzzles
  to the north and
  south...
* You'll have to solve
  them both to proceed!
* A-also... I'd like
  to say!
* I don't really...
* Like giving away
  puzzle solutions.
* But if you need
  help, just call
  me, ok?
* Actually, wait, I
  have an idea!
* Let's be friends
  on UnderNet!
* Then you can just
  ping me when you
  need help!
* Wait, we're already
  friends, aren't we?
* I signed you up,
  didn't I?
* You've been reading
  my posts the whole
  time...
* Well! I hope!
  You agree with me!
* About Mew Mew 2!
* Uh, h-h-hey!
* I'm going to the
  bathroom, so I'll
  be MIA for a bit.
* I'm... I'm sure you
  can handle this
  puzzle yourself!
* S-see that building in
  the distance?
* That's the CORE.
* The source of all power
  for the underground.
* It converts geothermal
  energy into magical
  electricity, by...
* Uhh, anyway, that's
  where we're going to
  go.
* In the CORE is an
  elevator directly to
  ASGORE's castle.
* And from there...
* You can go home.
* Uuuh, I think...
* Umm...
* Hey!
* About the puzzles on
  the left and right...!
* They're a bit difficult
  to explain, but...
* ... uhhh, you already
  s-solved them?
* Awesome!
* Alphys! Here!
* Th-that blue laser
  seems totally
  impassable!
* B-b-but!
* As the Royal Scientist,
  I h-have some tricks
  up my sleeve!
* I'll h-hack into th-the
  Hotland laser database
  and take it out!
* A-another laser,
  huh?
* I'm sorry, I won't
  play around this
  time.
* Hold on a second!!
    
* Your next location
  is that door up
  north.
* But! It's locked by
  two switched to the
  east and west.
* So!!!
* Head to those rooms
  first!!!
* I.M.O!!!!
* Acronyms kind of lose
  their punch out
  loud, huh?
* A-A-Alphys here!!!!
* Th... the northern door
  will stay locked until
  you...
* S-solve the puzzles on
  the right and left!
* I... I think you
  sh-should g-g-go to the
  right first!
* H... h... hi...
* It's me... Dr. Alphys...
* I said I would
  guide you...?
* But, um, I'm not
  very good at talking
  on the phone.
* Errrr, anyway!
* See those lasers?
* Try to remember your
  elementary bullet
  pattern class.
* Orange attacks can't
  hurt you if you're
  moving.
* Blue attacks can't
  hurt you if you're
  standing still.
* These lasers are the
  same way!
* It's, it's sort of like
  that episode where
  they...
* (Crash! Bang! Boom!)
* Uhhhhh, gotta go!
* Talk to you later!
* Uhh!
* H-hi, so, the blue
  lasers...
* Uhh!
* I mean, Alphys here!
* Hi!
* The blue lasers won't
  hurt you if you don't
  move!
* O-orange ones, um...
* Y-you have to be
  moving, and they...
* Um, they won't, um...
* Move through those
  ones!
* Uhh, bye!
* H... hi...!
* It's Dr. Alphys.
* This p-puzzle is
  kinda... um... timing-
  based.
* Y-you see those
  switches over there?
* Y-you'll have to press
  all three of them
  within 3 seconds.
* I'll t-try to help
  you with the
  rhythm!
* Um, is it really
  a good idea to be
  getting a snack?
* Well, I guess I
  really shouldn't
  judge you...
* After all, I'm the
  one eating potato
  chips in my PJs!
* Uhhh, I mean...
* H-hey, go over to
  the right!
* H-hey!
* Head over to the
  right!
Alphys (note)
* Hey.
* Thanks for your help back
  there.
* You guys...
* Your support really means a
  lot to me.
* But...
* As difficult as it is
  to say this...
* You guys alone can't
  magically make my own
  problems go away.
* I want to be a better
  person.
* I don't want to be
  afraid anymore.
* And for that to happen,
  I have to be able to
  face my own mistakes.
* I'm going to start
  doing that now.
* I want to be clear.
* This isn't anyone else's
  problem but mine.
* But if you don't ever
  hear from me again...
* If you want to know
  "the truth."
* Enter the door to the
  north of this note.
* You all at least deserve
  to know what I did.
* "elevator... lost power..."
* "enter the center door..."
* "drain... dropped it..."
* "cold..."
* "curtain..."
* "under... sheets..."
Alphys (screen)
* This is it...
* Time to do what the King
  has asked me to do.
* I will create the power to
  free us all.
* I will unleash the power of
  the SOUL.
* ASGORE asked everyone
  outside the city for monsters
  that had "fallen down."
* Their bodies came in today.
* They're still comatose...
* And soon, they'll all
  turn into dust.
* But what happens if I
  inject "determination" into
  them?
* If their SOULS persist
  after they perish, then...
* Freedom might be closer
  than we all thought.
* things aren't going well.
* none of the bodies have
  turned into dust, so I
  can't get the SOULs.
* i told the families that
  i would give them the
  dust back for the funerals.
* people are starting to
  ask me what's happening.
* what do i do?
* nothing is happening.
* i don't know what to do.
* i'll just keep injecting
  everything with
 "determination."
* i want this to work.
* Everyone that had fallen
  down...
* ... has woken up.
* They're all walking around
  and talking like nothing
  is wrong.
* I thought they were
  goners...?
* We'll need a vessel to
  wield the monster SOULs
  when the time comes.
* After all, a monster
  cannot absorb the SOULs
  of other monsters.
* Just as a human cannot
  absorb a human SOUL...
* So then...
* What about something that's
  neither human nor monster?
* Seems like this research
  was a dead end...
* But at least we got a
  happy ending out of it...?
* I sent the SOULS back to
  ASGORE, returned the
  vessel to his garden....
* And I called all of the
  families and told them
  everyone's alive.
* I'll send everyone back
  tomorrow. :) 
* monsters' physical forms
  can't handle "determination"
  like humans' can.
* with too much determination,
  our bodies begin to break
  down.
* everyone's melted together...
* I've been researching humans
  to see if I can find any
  info about their SOULS.
* I ended up snooping around
  the castle...
* And found these weird tapes.
* I don't feel like ASGORE's
  watched them...
* I don't think he should.
* the families keep calling
  me to ask when everyone
  is coming home.
* what am i supposed to say?
* i don't even answer the
  phone anymore.
* (It's too dark to see near
  the walls.)
* I've chosen a candidate.
* I haven't told ASGORE yet,
  because I want to surprise
  him with it...
* In the center of his
  garden, there's something
  special.
* The first golden flower,
  that grew before all the
  others.
* The flower from the outside
  world.
* It appeared just before
  the queen left.
* I wonder...
* What happens when something
  without a SOUL gains
  the will to live?
* The barrier is locked by
  SOUL power..
* Unfortunately, this power
  cannot be recreated
  artificially.
* SOUL power can only be
  derived from what was
  once living.
* So, to create more, we
  will have to use what we
  have now...
* The SOULs of monsters.
* one of the bodies opened
  its eyes.
* experiments on the
  vessel are a failure.
* it doesn't seem to be
  any different from the
  control cases.
* whatever.
* they're a hassle to work
  with anyway.
* the seeds just stick to
  you, and won't let go...
* no No NO NO NO NO NO
* now that mettaton's made it
  big, he never talks to
  me anymore.
* ... except to ask when i'm
  going to finish his body.
* but i'm afraid if i finish
  his body, he won't need me
  anymore...
* then we'll never be friends
  ever again.
* ... not to mention, every time
  i try to work on it, i
  just get really sweaty...
* ASGORE left me five
  messages today.
* four about everyone being
  angry
* one about this cute teacup

* thanks asgore.
* the flower's gone.
* But extracting a SOUL from
  a living monster would
  require incredible power...
* Besides being impractical,
  doing so would instantly
  destroy the SOUL's host.
* And, unlike the persistent
  SOULs of humans...
* The SOULs of most monsters
  disappear immediately upon
  death.
* If only I could make a
  monster's SOUL last...
* i spend all my time at

* I've done it.
* Using the blueprints, I've
  extracted it from the
  human SOULs.
* I believe this is what
  gives their SOULs the strength
  to persist after death.
* The will to keep living...
* The resolve to change fate.
* Let's call this power...
* "Determination."

And that's the
end of Hard
Mode!
That's the
difficult part.
Not the bullets.
But, accepting
that it's all
over...
Maybe.
Knowing the
answer is...
... HARD.
...
Hey!
Aren't you
supposed
to be dying or
something?
What will you do
instead...?
I thought it was
good.
Theoretically.
It's not like I
ate it all while
you were
fighting.
Hey! Hey!
Can I have some
pie!
I can helllp!!!
I'm not snoring,
I'm cheering you
on in my sleep!!
Oh, you're still
here?
Don't you have
anything better
to do?
I already said
that.
Annoying Dog (call)
* Bark!
* Bark!
* Bark...
* Bark!
* (Snore... snore...)
* (Achoo!)
* (Yawn...)
* (Blink blink.)

* This is the barrier.
* This is what keeps
  us all trapped
  underground.
* If...
* If by chance you
  have any unfinished
  business...
* Please do what you
  must.
* ...
* ... I see...
* This is it, then.
* I see.
* Anything you want to
  do is important
  enough.
* Even something as small
  as reading a book,
  or taking a walk...
* Please take your time.
* Oh...
* Back so soon?
* How are you feeling?
* Do what you have to.
* Um... what's an...
* ... anime?
* So it's like a
  cartoon...
* But with swords?
* So it's like a
  cartoon...
* But with guns?
* Golly!
* That sounds neato!
* Where is this?
* Where can I see the
  Anime.
* Golly.
* Were those two robots...
* Boy!
* Technology sure is
  something, isn't it?
* Frisk!
* I just realized!
* Now that we aren't
  fighting each
  other...
* I can finally ask
  you...
* "Would you like a
  cup of tea?"
* Would you like a
  cup of tea?
* Oh!
* Well!
* Actually, the cup I
  had is cold now.
* So you shouldn't
  have it.
* But, I am so
  happy you said
  yes.
* As soon as I can,
  I will make some
  more for you.
* Then we can be
  great pals.
* Oh...
* Okay.
* Um, it's OK, Undyne.
* My heart's already
  broken.
* Am I invited to
  the trash?
* Oh...
* Isn't it beautiful,
  everyone?
* I could stand here
  and watch this for
  hours...
* Oh, right.
* Everyone...
* This is the beginning
  of a bright new
  future.
* An era of peace between
  humans and monsters.
* Frisk...
* I have something to
  ask of you.
* Will you act as our
  ambassador to the
  humans?
You cannot.
Human...
It was
nice to
meet
you.
Goodbye.
Now,
now.
There's
no need
to
fight.
Why not
settle
this...
Over a
nice cup
of tea?
Ah...
So that
is how
it is.
Why...
You...
I remember the day
after my son
died.
The entire underground
was devoid of hope.
The future had once
again been taken
from us by the
humans.
In a fit of anger,
I declared war.
I said that I would
destroy any human
that came here.
I would use their
souls to become
godlike...
... and free us from
this terrible prison.
Then, I would destroy
humanity...
And let monsters rule
the surface, in peace.
Soon, the people's
hopes returned.
My wife, however,
became disgusted with
my actions.
She left this place,
never to be seen
again.
Truthfully...
I do not want power.
I do not want to
hurt anyone.
I just wanted everyone
to have hope...
I cannot take this
any longer.
I just want to
see my wife.
I just want to
see my child.
Please...
Young one...
This war has gone
on long enough.
You have the power...
Take my soul, and
leave this cursed
place.
After everything I
have done to
hurt you...
You would rather
stay down here
and suffer...
Than live happily
on the surface?
Human...
I promise you...
For as long as
you remain here...
My wife and I will
take care of you
as best we can.
We can sit in
the living room,
telling stories...
Eating butterscotch
pie...
We could be
like...
Like a family...
No.
That's just a
fantasy, isn't it?
Young one, when I
look at you...
I'm reminded of the
human that fell here
long ago...
You have the same
feeling of hope in
your eyes.
There is an ancient
prophecy among our
people...
One day, a savior
will come from the
heavens.
... I believe the
one that was
prophecied was you.
Somewhere in the
world outside...
There must be a way
to free us from our
prison.
It pains me to
give you this
responsiblity, but...
Please.
Take my soul...
and seek the truth.
Ha... ha...
I'm sorry...
I couldn't give you
a simple, happy
ending...
But I believe your
freedom...
... is what my son...
... what ASRIEL would
have wanted.
You are our future!     
Forgive
me for
this.
This is
my
duty.
  You cannot give
  up just yet...
!
  Stay determined...
  Our fate rests 
  upon you...
  You're going to
  be alright!
  Don't lose hope!
  It cannot end
  now!
, please...
* Wake up!
* You are the future
  of humans and
  monsters...
* Whoops.
* Uh, should I do
  something?
* Well, gotta go!
* Now, now.
* The important part
  is that Frisk is
  all right.
* Here, Frisk.
* Why not drink some
  tea?
* It'll make you feel
  better.
* Well, Papyrus, now
  that the war is
  over...
* We might not need
  the Royal Guard
  anymore.
* Howdy, Frisk.
* Sorry about almost
  trying to take
  your SOUL.
* I feel very bad
  about it.
* I hope we can
  still be pals.
* Oh... I see!
* In that case, I'm
  not sorry, Frisk.
* Oh, Frisk, if you're
  not busy...
* On nice days, you
  should walk around and
  have a good time.
* That's important.
* Ready?
* How tense...
* Just think of it like...
* A visit to the dentist.
* Are you ready?
* If you are not, I
  understand.
* I am not ready either.
* Dum dee dum...
* Oh?
* Is someone there?
* Just a moment!
* I have almost finished watering
  these flowers.
* Curious.
* I've never seen a plant...
* Cry before.
* ... Here we are!
* Howdy!
* How can I...
* Oh.
* I so badly want to
  say, "would you like
  a cup of tea?"
* You know how it is.
* Nice day today, huh?
* Birds are singing,
  flowers are blooming...
* Perfect weather for a
  game of catch.
* You know what we must
  do.
* When you are ready,
  come into the next
  room.
* You must be the one
  that flower just warned
  me about.
* Howdy!
* Erm...
* What kind of monster
  are you...?
* Sorry, I cannot tell.
* Well, we can always
Tori...
You
came
back...!
... Tori...
You're right...
I am a miserable
creature...
... but, do you think
we can at least be
friends again?
Human, for the
future of
humans and
monsters...!
You have to stay
determined...!

Asgore (video)
* Mmm?
* What is it, dear?
* ... err, and why do you
  have that video camera? 
* Hmmm...
* Carrots, right?
* Go back to bed, dear.
* Hmmm... I don't know, honey.
* What kind of dog would
  you be?
* Hohoho!
* You sure are excited to
  have this child.
* You know, if you keep
  making jokes like
  this...
* One day, you could be...
* ... a famous MOMedian.
* Hey!
* Come on, Tori!
* That one was funny!
* Goodnight, honey.
!
* You have to stay determined!
* You can't give up...
* You are the future of humans
  and monsters...
Asriel
* I always was a crybaby,
  wasn't I, 
* ... I know.
* You're not actually
  
, are you?
* 
's been gone for
  a long time.
* Um... what...
* What IS your name?
* "Frisk?"
* That's...
* A nice name.
* Frisk...
* I haven't felt like
  this for a long time.
* As a flower, I was
  soulless.
* I lacked the power to
  love other people.
* However, with everyone's
  souls inside me...
* I not only have my own
  compassion back...
* But I can feel every
  other monster's as
  well.
* They all care about
  each other so much.
* And... they care about
  you too, Frisk.
* I wish I could tell
  you how everyone
  feels about you.
* Papyrus... Sans...
* Undyne... Alphys...
* ... Toriel.
* Monsters are weird.
* Even though they barely
  know you...
* It feels like they
  all really love
  you.
* Haha.
* Frisk... I...
* I understand if you
  can't forgive me.
* I understand if you
  hate me.
* I acted so strange and
  horrible.
* I hurt you.
* I hurt so many people.
* Friends, family,
  bystanders...
* There's no excuse for
  what I've done.
* Wh... what?
* ... Frisk, come on.
* You're...
* You're gonna make me
  cry again.
* ... besides, even if
  you do forgive me...
* ... right.
* I understand.
* I just hope that...
* I can make up for
  it a little right
  now.
* I can't keep these
  souls inside of me.
* The least I can do
  is return them.
* But first...
* There's something I
  have to do.
* Right now, I can feel
  everyone's hearts
  beating as one.
* They're all burning
  with the same
  desire.
* With everyone's power...
* With everyone's
  determination...
* It's time for
  monsters...
* To finally go free.
* I have to go now.
* Without the power of
  everyone's souls...
* I can't keep
  maintaining this
  form.
* In a little while...
* I'll turn back into
  a flower.
* I'll stop being
  "myself."
* I'll stop being able
  to feel love again.
* So... Frisk.
* It's best if you
  just forget about
  me, OK?
* Just go be with
  the people who
  love you.
You know...
I don't care about
destroying this
world anymore.
After I defeat you
and gain total
control over the
timeline...
I just want to reset
everything.
All your progress...
Everyone's memories.
I'll bring them all
back to zero!
Then we can do
everything ALL over
again.
And you know what
the best part of
all this is?
You'll DO it.
And then you'll
lose to me again.
And again.
And again!!!
Because you want a
"happy ending."
Because you "love
your friends."
Because you "never
give up."
Isn't that
delicious?
Your "determination."
The power that let
you get this far...
It's gonna be your
downfall!
Now, ENOUGH messing
around!
It's time to purge
this timeline once
and for all!
... even after that
attack, you're still
standing in my way...?
Wow...
You really ARE
something special.
But don't get
cocky.
Up until now, I've
only been using
a fraction of my
REAL power!
Let's see what good
your DETERMINATION
is against THIS!!
Huh? What are you
doing...!?
Urah ha ha ha...
Behold my TRUE power!
I can feel it...
Every time you die,
your grip on this
world slips away.
Every time you die,
your friends forget
you a little more.
Your life will end
here, in a world
where no one
remembers you...
Still, you're
hanging on...?
That's fine.
In a few moments,
you'll forget
everything, too.
That attitude will
serve you well in
your next life!
Ura ha ha...
Still!?
Come on...
Show me what good
your DETERMINATION
is now!
Ultimate bepis
Wh...
what did you do...?
What's this
feeling...?
What's happening
to me?
No! NO!
I don't need
ANYONE!
STOP IT!
Get away from me!
Do you hear me!?
I'll tear you
apart!
...
Do you know why
I'm doing this...?
Why I keep fighting
to keep you
around...?
I'm doing this...
Because you're
special, 
You're the only one
that understands
me.
You're the only one
who's any fun to
play with anymore.
No...
That's not JUST
it.
I... I...
I'm doing this
because I care
about you, 
I care about you
more than anybody
else!
I'm not ready for
this to end.
I'm not ready for
you to leave.
I'm not ready to
say goodbye to
someone like
you again...
So, please...
STOP doing this...
AND JUST LET ME
WIN!!!
I'm so alone,
I'm so afraid,
, I...
I...
STOP IT!!
STOP IT NOW!!!
* Don't worry about
  me.
* Frisk, please leave
  me alone.
* I can't come back.
* I just can't, OK?
* I don't want to break
  their hearts all over
  again.
* It's better if they
  never see me.
* ... why are you still
  here?
* Are you trying to keep
  me company?
* Frisk...
* Hey.
* Let me ask you a
  question.
* Frisk...
* Why did you come
  here?
* Everyone knows the
  legend, right...?
* "Travellers who climb
  Mt. Ebott are said
  to disappear."
* Frisk.
* Why would you ever
  climb a mountain
  like that?
* Was it foolishness?
* Was it fate?
* Or was it...
* Because you...?
* Well.
* Only you know the
  answer, don't you...?
* I know why 

  climbed the mountain.
* It wasn't for a
  very happy reason.
* Frisk.
* I'll be honest with
  you.
 * 
 hated humanity.
* Why they did, they
  never talked about
  it.
* But they felt very
  strongly about
  that.
* Frisk...
* You really ARE different
  from 
* In fact, though you
  have similar, uh,
  fashion choices...
* I don't know why I
  ever acted like you
  were the same person.
* Maybe...
* The truth is...
* 
 wasn't really
  the greatest person.
* While, Frisk...
* You're the type of
  friend I wish I
  always had.
* So maybe I was kind
  of projecting a
  little bit.
* Let's be honest.
* I did some weird
  stuff as a flower.
* There's one last
  thing I feel like
  I should tell you.
* Frisk, when 

  and I combined our
  SOULs together...
* The control over our
  body was actually split
  between us.
* They were the one
  that picked up their
  own empty body.
* And then, when we
  got to the village...
* They were the one
  that wanted to...
* ... to use our full
  power.
* I was the one that
  resisted.
* And then, because of
  me, we...
* Well, that's why I
  ended up a flower.
* This whole time, I've
  blamed myself for
  that decision.
* That's why I adopted
  that horrible view
  of the world.
* "Kill or be killed."
* But now...
* After meeting you...
* Frisk, I don't regret
  that decision anymore.
* I did the right
  thing.
* If I killed those
  humans...
* We would have had to
  wage war against all
  of humanity.
* And in the end,
  everyone went free,
  right?
* I still feel kind
  of sad knowing how
  long it took...
* ... so maybe it
  wasn't a perfect
  decision.
* But you can't regret
  hard choices your
  whole life, right?
* Well, not that I
  have much of a life
  left.
* But that's besides
  the point.
* Frisk, thank you
  for listening to me.
* You should really go
  be with your friends
  now, OK?
* Oh, and, please...
* In the future, if you
  uh, see me...
* Don't think of it as
  me, OK?
* I just want you to
  remember me like this.
* Someone that was your
  friend for a little
  while.
* Oh, and Frisk...
* Be careful in the
  outside world, OK?
* Despite what everyone
  thinks, it's not as
  nice as it is here.
* There are a lot of
  Floweys out there.
* And not everything can
  be resolved by just
  being nice.
* Don't kill, and
  don't be killed,
  alright?
* That's the best you
  can strive for.
* Well, see you.
* Don't you have
  anything better to
  do?
It sounds like it
came from over
here...
Oh! You've fallen
down, haven't you...
Are you okay?
Here, get up...
, huh?
That's a nice name.
 My name is     
Finally.
I was so
tired of
being a
flower.
,
are you
there?
It's me,
your
best
friend.
* I'm so sorry.
* Ha... ha...
* I don't want to let
  go...
* You're...
* You're going to do
  a great job, OK?
* No matter what you
  do.
* Everyone will be
  there for you,
  okay?
* Well...
* My time's running out.
* Goodbye.
* By the way...
* ... take care of Mom
  and Dad for me, OK?
I mean, we haven't
even done the 
Special Thanks yet...
Ready?
Let's end all of
this for good!
Ha ha ha ha...
Did you REALLY
think it was
OVER!?!?
Asriel (call)
...
* Are you there?
* It's been a long time,
  hasn't it...?
* But you've done well.
* Thanks to you, everything
  has fallen into place.
* See you soon.
Asriel (video)
* Okay, 
, are you ready?
* Do your creepy face!
* AHHHHH!!
* Hee hee hee!
* Oh!
* Wait!
* I had the lens cap on...
* What!?
* You're not gonna do it
  again...?
* Come on, quit tricking me!
* Haha!
* Howdy, 
!
* Smile for the camera!
* Ha, this time I got YOU!
* I left the cap on...
* ON PURPOSE!
* Now you're smiling for
  noooo reason!
* Hee hee hee!
* What?
* Oh, yeah, I remember.
* When we tried to make
  butterscotch pie for Dad,
  right?
* The recipe asked for cups
  of butter...
* But we accidentally put
  in buttercups instead.
* Yeah!
* Those flowers got him
  really sick.
* I felt so bad.
* We made Mom really upset.
* I should have laughed it
  off, like you did...
* Um, anyway, where are you
  going with this?
* Huh?
* Turn off the camera...?
* OK.
* I... I don't like this idea,
  
* Wh.. what?
* N-no, I'm not...
* ... big kids don't cry.
* Yeah, you're right.
* No!
* I'd never doubt you, 
...
* Never!
* Y... yeah!
* We'll be strong!
* We'll free everyone.
* I'll go get the flowers.
* Psst... 
...
* Please... wake up...
* I don't like this plan
  anymore.
* I... I...
* ... no, I said...
* I said I'd never doubt you.
* Six, right?
* We just have to get six...
* And we'll do it together,
  right?
Astigmatism
You've
seen
enough.
Take
your
last
look.
What are
you so
afraid
of?
Finally,
someone
gets it.
How
dare
you.
That's
right!
You
dare
defy me?
You've
pushed
your
luck.
That
takes
guts.
...
Don't
pick on
me.
...
Pick on
me.
The king decided
it was time to
end our
suffering.
Every human who
falls down here
must die.
With enough souls,
we can shatter
the barrier
forever.
Ball Game
* Bravery. Justice.  
* Integrity. Kindness. 
* Perseverance. Patience.  
* Using these, you were
  able to win at "Ball Game."
* RED - Try as you might,
  you continue to be yourself.
* ORANGE - You are the kind of
  person who rushes fists-first
  through all obstacles.
* YELLOW - Your sure-fire
  accuracy put an end to
  the mayhem of "Ball."
* BLUE - Hopping and twirling,
  your original style
  pulled you through.
* GREEN - Your concern and care
  for "Ball" led you to a
  delicious victory.
* PURPLE - Even when you felt
  trapped, you took notes and
  achieved the end of "Ball."
* LIGHT BLUE - "Ball" is "Small."
* You waited, still, for
  this opportunity...
* ... then dethroned "Ball" with
  a sharp attack.
Big Mouth
* Hmmm...
* Isn't human food different
  from monster food?
* It does things like "spoil."
* And when you eat it, it
  passes all the way through
  your whole body.
* Disgusting.
* I'd love to try it sometime.
* And I've heard they have
  things called bathrooms.
* To a human, monster food
  would be very interesting.
* As soon as you eat it, it
  converts perfectly into
  energy.
* ... that makes me wonder.
* How do humans do it?
* Eat during battle...?
* Ice cream in one hand,
  sword in the other.
* That's the way of the
  monster warrior...
* Hmmm, this is around the
  time that Sans comes in.
* Then, a little bit later,
  his brother comes in,
  irritated.
* Yes, his brother.
* Papyrus.
* He's an interesting fellow.
* He always orders a glass of
  milk...
* He says it's "full of
  strong bones."
* Hope he shows up today.
* Soon, I'll be able to try
  some human food...
* And then I guess I'll try
  a human bathroom, too.
* Sans is interesting.
* He has told me about all
  kinds of incredible foods.
* But, despite his knowledge,
  he always orders the worst
  burger off the menu.
Big Mouth and Drunk Bun
* Greetings, Sans.
* Hiya, Sansy~
Bob
* Hi.
* I'm Bob.
* A pleasing development, no?
Bomb
Tick.
Tock.
Swish.
Book
* Unfortunately, monsters are
  not experienced with
  illness.
* However, when monsters are
  about to expire of age,
  they lie down, immobile.
* We call this state
  "Fallen Down."
* A person who has Fallen
  Down will soon perish.
* In a way, this confusing
  situation was all too
  familiar.
* When a human dies, its
  soul remains stable
  outside the body.
* Meanwhile, a monster's soul
  disappears near-instantly
  upon death.
* This allows monsters to
  absorb the souls of
  humans...
* While it is extremely
  difficult for humans to
  absorb a monster's soul.
* This is why they feared us.
* Though monsters are weak,
  with enough human souls...
* They could easily destroy
  all of mankind.
* There is one exception
  to the aforementioned
  rules:
* A certain type of monster,
  the "boss" monster.
* Due to its life cycle, it
  possesses an incredibly
  strong soul for a monster.
* This soul can remain
  stable after death, if
  only for a few moments.
* Monster funerals, technically
  speaking, are super crap.
* When monsters die, their
  bodies turn into dust.
* One time this kid at my school
  went missing for a week and
  everyone thought he was dead...
* But then he came back!!!
* Turns out he was visiting his
  girlfriend in Hotland and
  and didn't tell anyone!
* To be scientific, it sucks
  that no one ever knows
  if anyone's dead or alive.
* So yeah, what do we do at
  funerals, anyway?
* Professionally speaking:
* DUH!!!
* We pour the dust on whatever
  that person liked.
* Then they will live on...
  ... in that object...
  ... symbolically...
* Uhhh, did I reach the page
  minimum yet?
* I'm kinda sick of writing.
* Monster funerals, technically
  speaking, are cool as heck.
* When monsters get old and
  kick the bucket, they turn
  into dust.
* At funerals, we take that
  dust and spread it on that
  person's favorite thing.
* Then their essence will live
  on in that thing...
* Uhhh, am I at the page
  minimum yet?
* I'm kinda sick of writing this.
* Trapped behind the barrier
  and fearful of further
  human attacks, we retreated.
* Far, far into the earth
  we walked, until we reached
  the cavern's end.
* This was our new home,
  which we named...
* "Home."
* As great as our king is,
  he is pretty lousy at
  names.
* "Typha" - A group of wetland
  flowering plants with
  brown, oblong seedpods.
* Known more commonly as
 "water sausages."
* While monsters are mostly made
  of magic, human beings are
  mostly made of water.
* Humans, with their physical
  forms, are far stronger
  than us.
* But they will never know
  the joy of expressing
  themselves through magic.
* They'll never get a bullet-
   pattern birthday card...
* Because they are made of
  magic, monsters' bodies are
  attuned to their SOUL.
* If a monster doesn't want
  to fight, its defenses will
  weaken.
* And the crueller the intentions
  of our enemies, the more
  their attacks will hurt us.
* Therefore, if a being with
  a powerful SOUL struck with
  the desire to kill...
* Um, let's end the chapter
  here...
* "MONSTER HISTORY PART 4"
* Fearing the humans no longer,
  we moved out of our old
  city, HOME.
* We braved harsh cold, damp
  swampland, and searing heat...
* Until we reached what we now
  call our capital.
* "NEW HOME."
* Again, our King is really
  bad at names...?
* Love, hope, compassion...
* This is what people say
  monster SOULs are made of.
* But the absolute nature of
  "SOUL" is unknown.
* After all, humans have proven
  their SOULs don't need these
  things to exist.
Bratty
Like, OK I guess.
* Hey!
* Check it
  out!
So, like,
what's up?
* Thanks, but we,
  like, don't
  really need
  anything.
* Oh my God.
* Is that a
  glamburger?
* Like, see
  you later!  
* I'm Bratty, and
  this is my
  best friend,
  Catty.
* Well, that kind
  of guy...
* You hang out
  with him once,
  then he wants
  to hang out...
* All.
* The.
* Time.
* Oh, uh...
* OK, like,
  the annoying
  thing is...
* Oh, that guy
  from the
  store?
* Yuck, what a
  creep.
* So, we're
  like,
  totally
  free now,
  huh?
* Where do we
  get the
  garbage?
* Like, the
  garbage store,
  duh!!!
* I mean, like,
  where does
  anyone get guns,
  or food, or...
* The stuff
  inside, is
  like...
* Oh, oops,
  really?
* Uh, well,
  when we
  said, um...
* We were
  hyped for the
  destruction
  of humanity...
* We were,
  just, like,
  joking, you
  know?
* So, like,
  Dr. Alphys
  built Mettaton,
  right?
* Oh my God.
* Mettaton.
* He's like...
* My robot
  husband.          
* I think we're
  like... both
  going to marry
  him.
* Hmmm...
* Now that
  we're
  gonna be
  free...
* Oh my God.
* Alphys.
* She used to
  live on our
  street.
* So Alphys
  has always,
  like...
* Oh my God.
* He's a total
  goober.
* Like, I LOVE
  that guy.
* God, we're
  like...
* SO hyped for
  the destruction
  of humanity.
* Me?
* Yeah, I
  LOVE cats!
* They're,
  like,
  SO tasty!!
* But, like, this
  stuff we found
  is like...
* You should...
* TOTALLY wicked
  buy all of
  it?
* It's GOOD
  garbage.
* .....
* Waterfall
  mostly.                  
* But like...
* Mettaton always
  acts like...
* And even right
  after he was
  built...
* But they're
  like...
* Not friends
  anymore.
* I mean, like,
  if your big
  sister...
* She showed us
  the coolest
  places to
  find trash.
* Then she
  became the
  Royal
  Scientist...
* So, like, I'm
  pretty sure
  she...
* A robot with a
  SOUL...
* So after seeing
  Mettaton,
  ASGORE...
* Or...
  her at all...
* Like, live
  a little,
  girl.
* We don't.
* Really need.
* Anything.
* God, Catty.
* Try to have
  some
  self-control.
* 'Cause they
  OBVIOUSLY
  brought that
  Glamburger
  for ME.
* C'mon,
  Catty, don't
  you have
  ANY
  standards?
* But he just
  acts...
* Really
  weird.
* Like, when
  we asked him
  to get those
  Glamburgers...
* We were,
  like, going
  to share
  them.
* Catty!!
* But like, if
  we let him
  hang out with
  us... I just
  worry it'll...
* Um, that was
  NOT what I
  was gonna say.
* Uh, so?
* ... so is he
  free after
  work?
* Like...
* Cool.
* Like,
  milennia
  of being
  imprisoned
  finally over?
* Probably?
* It's, like,
  practically
  our
  catchphrase.
* Um, no?
* We've like
  literally
  NEVER said
  that.
* That's, like,
  YOUR dream,
  Catty.
* Aww...
* Catty...
* Catty!!!
* I'm just
  kidding!!
* Kind of.
* Anyway, when
  was the last
  time you even
  SAW a cat
  around here?
* .....
* .....
* ... Catty.
* I think that
  was, like...
* A dog.
Bratty (note)
* Hey, this is
  Bratty!
* If you're
  reading
  this...
* Alphys just
  came here
  and she's
  taking us...
* But, first,
  we gotta use
  up these gel
  pens.
* And don't even
  THINK about
  stealing our
  stuff.
* Catty, it's
  not JUNK.
* It's really
  valuable.
* Anyway.
* In closing:
* You're a
  total loser!
* Signed,
  Bratty <3
Burgerpants
* The customer is always right.
* Welcome to MTT-Brand
  Burger Emporium, home

How can
I help
you, O
customer?
Thanksy!
Have a
FABU-FUL
day!!!
So do
you want
it or
not???
That's not
the right
amount of
money.
You
don't
have
room.
We don't
HAVE
any
more.
Take what
you want,
little
buddy.
Here you
go,
little
buddy.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Sorry...
You can't
take it
for free.
You gotta
drop some
stuff.
Like I'm
making
THAT
again.
Are you
gonna
order or
what?
Here you
go,
little
weirdo.
Take it
from me,
little
buddy.
Nothing
else to
do!
* (WHY IS THIS PERSON TRYING TO
  SELL ME SOMETHING THIS IS
  A HAMBURGER RESTAURANT I'M
  JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE)
* WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE.
* Hmmm...
* Why not try selling that to
  the two chicks in the alley?
* Ah. Yes.
* I really want to buy your
  weird dusty artifacts...
* NOT.
* Have a SPARKULAR day!
* Any time, little buddy.
* Alone again...
* I'm getting on in years, so
  let me give you some
  advice, little buddy.
* You've still got time.
* Don't live like me.
* I'm 19 years old and I've
  already wasted my entire life.
* So we're free, huh?
* Mettaton told us as much.
* Then he told me, "don't
  think that means you're
  getting out of work early."
* Ah... my boss.
* I love that guy.
* And by that I mean I hate
  him so, so much.
* Evacuation?
* You're yanking my chain,
  little weirdo.
* So WHAT if everybody else
  left work?
* So WHAT if nobody's buying
  anything?
* Par for the course,
  little weirdo.
* Par for the course.
* I'm a goofy goober Yeah 
  this errorr. message.
* Thank you, little buddy.
* They wanna hang out after
  work?
* Ha! Ahahaha!! Yes!!!
* I won't let you down!!
* Little buddy... thank you.
* You've brought a tear to the
  eye of this old man.
* So, uh, where do they
  want to go?
* They want to hang out at
  the garbage dump.
* Well, nowhere to go but
  up, right, little buddy?
* Hey little buddy, wanna help
 me pick a spicy outfit for
 my little shindig later?
* Though, now that I think
 about it, I had to throw away
 all of my clothes to make
 room for the outfits Mettaton
 gave me...
* Don't take it the wrong way.
* They're just all these...
* Weird getups.
* "Promotional" costumes.
* For "holidays."
* Or "specials."
* Or "because he felt like it."
* The thing IS though!
* Most of the time I'm the
 only employee who has to
 wear this stuff!
* Sometimes he even calls me
 into his office just to...
* Make me put something on...
* Then he laughs and lets me
 go back to work as normal.
* Anyways, I won't sweat it,
 little buddy.
* I'll take it casual.
* NEVER let hot people think
 you care.
* That's how they GET you.
* Well?
* Don't keep me waiting,
  little buddy!!
* The girls were...
* Talking about me...?
* They say I should stop acting
  like they owe me...
* ... and if I want to be
  FRIENDS with them, I should
  just... uh, try to see
  things from their
  perspective?
* Wow.
* Poor, naive little buddy.
* They've brainwashed you.
* "Friendship" is just a hot
  person's way of making you
  their slave.
* So, uh, what time would
  they wanna hang out?
* Huh?
* Yeah, those two vendors in back.
* The girls.
* NOT the Nice Cream guy.
* He keeps coming in here and
 asking me stuff like,
* "Hey Burgy, what do you think
 of this joke for my next
 ice cream wrapper?"
* Joke?
* Why are you calling it a JOKE?
* You drew a picture of two
 dudes hugging and wrote
 "I love hugs!" on it.
* You somehow understand comedy
 EVEN LESS than that guy who
 keeps going on stage and
 crying about his family.
* Anyway, I, uh, just tell him
 that they're good, because he
 gives me the nice cream for
 free afterward...
* Everyone calls me burgerpants
  now.
* But you won't, will you,
  little buddy?
* So I went out to the alley
  to see those two ladies, and
  uh... you know, see what'd
  happen next.
* Then my boss, uh, saw me and
  asked me what I was doing.
* I was so startled, the hamburgers
  in my pockets tumbled out
  onto the ground.
* Not wanting to lose face,
  I scrambled to pick them up!
* But, as I was leaning over,
  the weight of the remaining
  hamburgers...
* ... caused my pants to fall
  down.
* Then the girls laughed at me.
* Everyone calls me Burgerpants
  now.
* Listen.
* I like you, little buddy.
* So I'm gonna save you a lot
  of trouble.
* Never interact with attractive
  people.
* Unless you're "one of them,"
  they're just gonna take
  advantage of you.
* Like that time those two
  chicks asked me to sneak them
  some glamburgers.
* And I, naive teenager that
  I was, said yes to them.
* Bad idea.
* Those girls?
* The ones who saw my pants
  fall down?
* Well, we're all gonna be
  free, so I'll never see
  them again, at least!
* So we're free now.
* Does that mean my double-
  date is cancelled...?
* I know, it wasn't really
  a...
* A date.
* Here's a trick, little buddy:
* Lie to yourself all the time.
* It makes you feel better.
* Well, Mettaton didn't tell me
  I HAD to work, I guess...
* But that's the thing!
* Sometimes he doesn't even
  call me into work until
  halfway into my shift!
* If I don't play it safe,
  he's going to yell at me.
* Okay, maybe "yell" is the
  wrong term.
* It's more like he has this...
* CD album he plays...
* That's entirely full of
  songs about how bad I am
  at my job.
* Let's not talk about this.
* Why do people find him so
  attractive??
* He's literally just a freaking
  rectangle.
* You know, one time, I bought
  one of those, uh, kits
  online... to...
* Uh, make yourself more
  rectangular.
* They don't work.
* God, have you even looked
  around?
* This place is a labyrinth of
  bad choices.
* And every time we try to change
  something for the better, he
  vetoes it and says "that's not
  how they do it on the
  surface."
Oh! Right!
* Humans are always eating
  hamburgers made of SEQUINS
  AND GLUE.
* When I first came to Hotland,
  it was my dream to work
  with Mettaton.
* Well, be careful what you
  wish for, little buddy!
* Don't tell anyone this, Little
  Buddy.
* (Because they'll make fun
  of me,)
* But I...
* I feel like I played a hand in
  everyone getting free
  somehow.
* Even if it was just
  working this awful job...
* I think I did something!
* I don't know if it's true,
  but I'll believe it anyway!
* Huh?
* Everyone else is DEAD?
* Does that mean I don't
  have to work today?
* God.
* That it were true,
  little weirdo.
* That it were true.
* Future?
* WHAT future?
* Nothing down here EVER
  changes.
* I'll probably be trapped
  at this stupid job forever.
* But wait!
* There's one thing that keeps
  me going!
* If ASGORE gets just one
  more SOUL, we'll finally get
  to go to the surface!
* It'll be a brand new world!
* There's gotta be a second
  chance out there for me!
* For everyone!
* So stay strong, little buddy.
* When I make it big, I'll
  keep you in mind.
* Little buddy!
* There's a brand new world
  out there waiting
  for us.
* I'm sure with my (ahem)
  qualifications, it won't
  be long before I'm a
  famous movie star...
* Or, maybe I'll just end up
  flipping burgers again.
* But it's as I say!
* Nowhere to go but up!
* Literally, in this case!
* Sorry, little weirdo.
* Threats won't work on me.
* I can't go to hell.
* I'm all out of vacation
  days.
* I'm sorry, (Ha ha) it's against
  the rules to talk to customers
  who haven't bought anything.
* What?
* Why do you keep trying to talk
  to me?
* I'll get in trouble if I get
  chummy with the customers.
* Sorry.
* SO, I wanted to be an ACTOR.
Business Dude 1
* The way to work is blocked,
  so I had time to catch
  Mettaton's show on my phone...
* The special effects were
  amazing today!
* That human almost looked REAL!
* Of course, an experienced
  viewer like me knows CGI
  when they see it...
* The barrier's opened up, so
  we don't have to go to
  work today.
* I mean, sure, we're free,
  but it's the little
  things, you know?
* That last episode had me
  really shaken...
* But Mettaton's OK.
* Everyone knows it's just CGI!
Business Dude 2
* Mettaton?
* Yeah, he's the most popular
  star in the underground!
* His fan club probably has
  at least two... no, THREE
  dozen members!
* And that's not even counting
  me!
* Today, we all started as
  co-workers...
* Who knows what we'll be
  tomorrow?
* What a heartbreaker.
* I bet his fanclub's almost
  doubled in size from that!
Business Manticore
* This elevator goes straight
  to the capital.
* But it stopped working.
* The hotel's doing its best to
  accomodate everybody
  stuck here.
* Me?
* I just like explaining things
  to passersby.
* Good news!
* The elevator started working
  again.
* But now it's been so busy,
  we still haven't gotten the
  chance to ride it.
* Mettaton hasn't made a
  performance for more
  than five minutes...
* What's happening...?
* Can you explain it?
Catty
Bratty! Bratty!
That's MY name!
* Yeah!
* Check it
  out!
You should
buy ALL
our stuff!
Bratty!
We're
gonna
be rich!
So are
you gonna
buy it??
You need
WAY more
money.
You have
TOO many
items!!!
We're all
$$$$$old
out!
Mee-YOW!
* Like, later
  and stuff!
* I'm Catty, and
  this is my
  best friend,
  Bratty.
* Oh my GOD,
* METTATON.
* Actually he's
  like...
* MY robot
  husband.
* We're both
  like, ALREADY
  married to
  him.      
* He just, like,
  doesn't know
  it yet.
* Oh my god,
* ALPHYS.
* She was like
  a big sister.      
* He's a big,
  fuzzy
  goofball!!   
* He's like,
  SO nice.  
* God, we're
  like...
* SO hyped for
  the destruction
  of humanity.
* Me?
* Yeah, I
  LOVE cats!
* They're,
  like,
  SO cute!!!
* TOTALLY wicked
  expensive.
* TOTALLY wicked
  cheap.
* Like...      
* TOTALLY wicked
  buy all of
  it?
* We found it in
  the garbage!
* It's like,
  really good
  garbage.
* .....
* I found a gun
  in a dumpster!
* That's like,
  what they
  TELL you.
* ... being built
  was HIS
  idea somehow.
* ... he acted
  like Alphys was
  an old friend.
* Yeah!!!
* Unlike me
  and Bratty!!
* Best friends
  for-EVER!!!
* Takes you on
  trips to the
  dump.
* She was always
  collecting
  these weird
  cartoons.
* Yeah, we
  haven't seen
  her in
  forever...
* Thought ASGORE
  is a SUPER
  cutie.
* Made Mettaton
  to, like,
  totally
  impress him.
* That's, like,
  SUPER relevant
  to his hobbies!
* Asked her to do
  all this science
  stuff for him!
* But nobody's,
  like, seen
  anything from
  her yet.
* She must,
  like, just
  stay in her
  lab all day.
* Yeah!!!
* Like us!!!
* Oh my god,
  can you go
  get us some
  Glamburgers?
* Wait! I'll pay
  you 1000G if
  you get Mettaton
  to autograph
  my butt!
* OH MY GOD!!!
* GIMME!!!
* Sorry...
* NOOO WAYYY!!!!!
* Yeah! He's
  a creep!
* But he's kind
  of cute,
  too...
* Nope!!!
* He'd be OK
  if he just
  treated us
  with some
  respect.
* And then acts
  like it's OUR
  fault he
  acts that
  way!
* He dropped them
  and ran away
  before we
  could even say
  anything!
* Really?
* I wasn't.
* Yeah!!
* He should come
  look for
  junk with us!
* ... be really
  super fun!
* But I was
  close, right!?
* But don't you
  feel bad for
  him, Bratty?
* Poor
  Burgerpants...
* Think about how
  cool we are
  compared to
  him!!!
* We'd be saving
  his LIFE with
  our
  friendship!!
* His LIFE,
  Bratty!!
* ... 
* Think of all
  the glamburgers
  he could get
  for us!!
* Yeah, like,
  totally
  free.
* Yeah, like,
  cool.
* Yeah, that's
  like pretty
  chill I guess.
* Did we say
  that?
* Really?
* I thought our
  catchphrase
  was...
* B-B-Bratty's
  the best,
  C-C-Catty's
  the coolest!
* CAN it be
  though!?
* CAN it be!?
* OMG, we
  can finally
  fulfill our
  DREAM of having
  a pet cat!
* But Bratty...
* I don't wanna
  have a dream
  without YOU
  in it...!
* And, in my
  dream, YOU clean
  up after
  the cat!
* Bratty
  NOOOO!!!
* Oh!!
* JUST the other
  day!
* There was
  this CUTE
  little white
  cat walking
  around...
* It was, like,
  SOOOOOO
  clueless
  looking.
* I pet it
  for like an
  hour!!
* Yeah, Bratty?
* DOGS ARE JUST
  FIRM CATS!!!!
Catty (note)
* Hey, this is
  Catty! 
* Then, like,
  bad news you
  mega-evil
  weirdo!
* Someplace
  super duper
  safe!
* Yeah!
* Chill, Alphys!
* We don't wanna
  waste pens!
* Yeah, creep!
* Leave our
  junk alone!
* Yeah!
* Our garbage
  is REALLY
  valuable!
* Yeah!

Interesting.
You want to go back.
You want to go back
to the world
you destroyed.
It was you who pushed
everything to its edge.
It was you who led the world
to its destruction.
But you cannot accept it.
Exactly.
Then what are you looking for?
Perhaps.
We can reach a compromise.
You still have something
I want.
Give it to me.
And I will bring this
world back.
Then it is agreed.
Then stay here for
all eternity.
Then, it is done.
* About time.
* Right where it belongs.
* In my way.
* Not worth talking to.
* PAPYRUS - ATK 3 DEF 3
* Forgettable.
* MONSTER KID 2 ATK 2 DEF
* Looks like free EXP.
* GLAD DUMMY - ATK 0 DEF 0 
* Wipe that smile off your
  face.
* I see two lovers staring over
  the edge of the cauldron of
  hell.
* Do they both wish for death?
* That means their love will
  end in hell.
* I couldn't stop laughing.
Greetings.
I am 
Thank you.
Your power awakened
me from death.
My "human soul."
My "determination."
They were not mine,
but YOURS.
At first, I
was so confused.
Our plan had failed,
hadn't it?
Why was I brought
back to life?
You.
With your guidance.
I realized the purpose
of my reincarnation.
Power.
Together, we eradicated
the enemy and became
strong.
HP. ATK. DEF.
GOLD. EXP. LV.
Every time a number
increases, that
feeling...
That's me.
Now.
Now, we have reached
the absolute.
There is nothing
left for us here.
Let us erase this
pointless world, and
move on to the next.
The demon that comes
when people call
its name.
It doesn't matter when.
It doesn't matter where.
Time after time,
I will appear.
And, with your help.
We will eradicate the
enemy and become
strong.
But.
You and I are not
the same, are we?
This SOUL resonates
with a strange
feeling.
There is a reason
you continue to
recreate this world.
There is a reason
you continue to
destroy it.
You are wracked with
a perverted
sentimentality.
Hmm.
I cannot understand
these feelings
any more.
Despite this.
I feel obligated to
suggest.
Should you choose to
create this world
once more.
Another path would
be better suited.
Now, partner.
Let us send this
world back into the
abyss.
Right. You are a
great partner.
We'll be together
forever, won't we?
No...?
Hmm...
How curious.
You must have
misunderstood.
SINCE WHEN WERE YOU
THE ONE IN CONTROL?
Hmm...
This feeling you have.
This is what I
spoke of.
Unfortunately,
regarding this...
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE
LONG AGO.

* Shouldn't proceed yet.

You think you are above

You will give me your SOUL.

* Boy, was today a FUN day!
* I sure love PUZZLE!!!
* So, if we're leaving, will
  my job...?
* Ugh, and I just got a raise!
* Well, guess every apple has
  its CORE, heheh.
* Today, we received the
  promise of a lot of money

* Heh...
* I guess we'll have to go to

* There are woods there we can

* Guh huh huh huh.
* Us teens rule these woods

* I'm worried about getting

* I'll stop being a teen.
* No! I refuse!
* I'll just invent new numbers,

Clam Girl
* I'm visiting Waterfall
  from the city.
* Synchronicity...?
* My neighbor's daughter looks
  about your age.
* Her name is "Suzy."
* I feel like you two should
  be friends.
* You have...
* A neighbor's blessing!!!
* Not knowing where I live
  is no issue.
* Fate finds a way.
* In life's grand scheme, she
 might be why you came here
 in the first place...
* I sense a disturbance in
  the nearby aura...
* I think you should leave
  that girl alone.
* So you never met my
  neighbor's daughter.
* Don't despair.
* This world has infinite
  opportunities.
* But there's a limit to the
  things you can do today.
* Accepting this is healthy.
* Take my neighbor's blessing!
* And consider this blessing
  for anything you like!
* I wanted to tell you about
  my neighbor's daughter.
* But you walked right by me
  before I could tell you.
* Fate has decided that I
  should not tell you.
Clam Guy
* O, k, k, k, k...
* I was thirsty, so I came
  over from Waterfall to get
  a drink!
* O, k, k...
* What are you doing with
  all of that water?
* So now we have a private pool?
* Worse things have happened.
* Are you just carrying that
  around to look sophisticated?
* Cause it's not working.
* I'll be able to have a nice
  drink on the surface.
Dad Slime
* Ah, to be young again.
* The world sure felt boundless.
* You like to wander.
* You must be young.
* Seems like this is the
  beginning of a brand-new,
  boundless world...
* Wah-ha!
* This adventurous spirit!
* I'm like a kid again!
* And my children are like...
* Double-children.
* I've sent the kids inside.
* It feels unsafe here today.

Diamond Boy 1
* My fave Mettaton Moment(TM)?
* Right when everything looks the
  baddest, he poses dramatically.
* Like when he's on a cooking
  show and the eggs don't turn
  out right.
* But!
* Then he says!
* Even if you suck at cooking,
  you can always buy an
  MTT-brand Glamburger!
* Then he eats one! 
* Everyone loves it!
* ... How does he eat it
  without a mouth?
* Uhhh... well...
* Watch the show!
* That finale was really...
* That was really sad!
* And Mettaton's schedule
  doesn't show any other
  shows...
* I've been thinking about
  getting a sick skateboard.
Diamond Boy 2
* My fave Mettaton Moment(TM)
  is when he beats up the
  heel-turning villains!
* Even if it's during what's
  supposed to be a quiz show.
* Oh! And I like when he tries
  on all kinds of different
  fashionable outfits!
* Even if it's during what's
  supposed to be a newscast.
* Did Mettaton retire...?
* Can't he unretire...?
* On the surface we'll be able
  to watch all kinds of TV...
* But, I bet none of those
  shows are as good as
  Mettaton's!
Diamond Receptionist
* Welcome to MTT Resort - 
* Hotland's biggest apartment-
  building-turned-hotel!
* Whether you're here for a night
  or still live here, MTT Resort
  prides itself on a great stay!
* Just passing through...? Nice!
* MTT Resort prides itself on
  being passed through!
* Sorry - the resort's shutting
  down.
* But I think you'll find it's
  still great to pass through!
* Welcome to MTT Resort!
* Have you seen Mettaton?
* He hasn't come by lately.
* I have a lot of respect for
  that man.
* I had trouble getting a job
  because I am so pointy and
  angular.
* But, being a rectangle, he
  understood my struggles.

Hm?
What's
that
smell?
What!
Smells
like a
...
Paws off
you
smelly
human.
Wow!!!
Pet by
another
pup!!!
Stop!
Don't
touch
her!
What
about
me......
........
Whine.
Whimper.
* Hmmm...
* Here's that weird smell...
* It makes me want to
  eliminate.
* Thanks, weird puppy!
* You better watch where you
  sit down in here, kid.
* Because that big guy WILL jump
  into your lap and give you
  lots of love and attention.
* Where's Sans...
* He's supposed to give me
  a pat on the head...
* She hasn't been responding
  to our letters...
* Maybe it's because we let
  Doggo write them all.
* I was hoping Sans came in
  to give me a pat on the
  head.
* Interloper...!
* Where's that big lug?
* We can't start until he
  shows up.
* Smells kinda... quiet.
* Hmmm, now that our parents
  are the same entity...
* Does that mean I'm
  married to my sister?
* Wait, we're dogs.
* That stuff's normal.
Dogamy and Dogaressa
* What's that smell?
* (Where's that smell?)
* If you're a smell...
* (... identify yoursmellf!)
* Dogs can pet other dogs???
* (A new world has opened
  up for us...)
* Weird smells can bring
  good things...
* (Friendly fun fetch!)
* Thanks, weird smell!
* (It sure was fun to
  "stick" together!)
* Hey, Sans.
* (Hi, Sans.)
Dogaressa
(Don't,
actually
...)
(He
means
me.)
(Of
course
we were

(Do
humans
have
tails?)
(Smell
mystery)
(Are you
actually
a little
puppy!?)
(Beware
of
dog.)
(A dog
that pets
dogs...
Amazing!)
(That's
not your
husband,
OK?)
(Well.
Don't
leave me
out!)
(Misery
awaits
you.)
(Kneel
and
suffer!)
(I'll
chop you
in
half!)
* (... Eliminate YOU!)
* (We're sentries, but we never
  get any respect.)
* (I wish those skeletons would
  throw us a bone.)
* (We love bones.)
* (Where are those skeletons?)
* (I wanted to get a bone
  from them...)
* (We're considering paying a
  visit to the doctor.)
* (No! Not the vet!)
* (... well, maybe she's a
  little like a vet.)
* (I like Sans.)
* (Sometimes he feeds us scraps
  of food under the table.)
* (Then his brother gets mad...)
* (But why!? We're adults!)
* (We can handle it!)
* (Where's Doggo?)
* (I hope he didn't get
  lost again.)
* (It's lonely in here today.)
* (If our friends don't show up,
  would you like to play?)
* (All of our parents have
  been combined into one
  horrible being.)
* (That's OK, though.)
* (It's really "brought our
  families together.")

Come on,

Pet...
me...
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Ahhhh,
humans
are
nice.
Hey!!
That
was
fun!!
Doggo
Don't
move an
inch!
It moved
!! It
didn't
NOT move!
Will it
move
this
time?
HUH!!!
A FUN
STICK
APPEARS!
WHAT!!!
I'VE
BEEN
PET!!!
WHERE'S
THAT
COMING
FROM!
THERE'S
NO END
TO IT!!
WELL,
THIS IS
THOROUGH
!!!
OK.
That's
enough.
FETCH?
PET?
PAT?
POT?
MOVING?
* Did something move?
* Was it my imagination?
* I can only see moving
  things.
* If something WAS moving...
* For example, a human...
* I'll make sure it NEVER
  moves again!
* H... hey!
* I can't stop shivering
  all of a sudden.
* Who... who's there!?
* S-S-S-Something pet me...
* Something that isn't
  m-m-moving...
* I'm gonna need some dog
  treats for this!!!
* A stick appeared out of
  nowhere, then disappeared.
* Was it a ghost stick?
* Did I just return it to
  the afterlife?
* I need some dog treats
  to think about this.
* Hello?
* Is anybody there...?
* No?
* Are you two playing a trick
  on me?
* Real funny.
* Big guy?
* Is that you?
* Come on...
* Well, it's not the tall
  skeleton...
* He's too loud.
* Whoever you are, knock it
  off!!!
* I'm thinking of getting a
  spiked collar to show off
  my personality.
* It makes a statement like...
* "Attach a leash to me and
  take me for a walk please."
* He may not look like it,
  but this big guy writes
  the most eloquent letters.
* Here, take a look!
* Papyrus?
* Is that you?
 Come on...
* Undyne!?
* Did you come all the way
  out here...?
* Huh?
* Since when did you and
  Sans become friends...?
* I don't like him...
* He loves to appear without
  moving.
* Where're the other two?
* I can't play with this
  big dumb guy alone...
* He'll just win!!!
* Sometimes the others like to
  prank me. They sit still
  so I can't see them.
* They must be here, playing a
  joke on me.
* I'll just wait until one of
  them admits it...
* Having an amorphous,
  shambling family member
  is great.
* They're always moving, so I
  can see them 100-percent
  of the time!
Dress Lion
* Mettaton looked really...
* Really cool in that dress.
* It sort of makes me feel like
  I could wear one, too!
* Mettaton...!
* He recognized my voice from
  when I called in, and...
* He... he gave me his dress!
* I'm so...!
* Ha ha ha!
* Please don't talk to me.
* I am feeling discouraged
  about something.
Drunk Bun
* No matter where I go,
  it's the same menu, the
  same people...
* Help!
* I want new drinks an'
  h-h-h-hot guys!!!!
* I guess the bartender's kind
  of h-h-h-hot...
* C'mon everybody!!!
* L-l-l-let's party!!!
* ... anyone?
* Sansyyyy...
* Come back and sit with me...
* Everything's so fun when
  you're around!!!
* It's s-s-so quiet in here.
* L-lighten up everybody!
* This is why I hate
  th-this place.
* I w-wonder if the
  o-overworld h-has h-hot
  guys...
*  A-and neat d-drinks...
* Ooooooo, I'm ready!
* H-hey, isn't Sansy s'posed
  to come swinging in right
  about now???
* C'mon Sansy!
* You're the life of the
  party...

Echo Flower
* Behind you.
* (It's strangely silent.)
* Sitting behind rushing water...
* It makes me feel relaxed.
* I swore I saw something...
* Behind that rushing water...
* I just wasn't ready for
  the responsibility.
* A long time ago, monsters would
  whisper their wishes to the
  stars in the sky.
* If you hoped with all your
  heart, your wish would come
  true.
* Now, all we have are these
  sparkling stones on the
  ceiling...
* Thousands of people wishing
  together can't be wrong!
* The king will prove that.
* C'mon, sis!
* Make a wish!
* I wish my sister and I will
  see the real stars someday...
* Ah... seems my horoscope is
  the same as last week's...
* Squeak.
* (You hear a passing
  conversation.)
* Don't say that!
* Come on, I promise I
  won't laugh.
* So? Don't you have any
  wishes to make?
* ... hmmm, just one, but...
* It's kind of stupid.
* I can't run any longer...
* Somebody, anybody...
* Someday, I'd like to climb
  this mountain we're all
  buried under.
* Sorry, it's just funny...
* That's my wish, too.
* (You hear laughter.)
* ... hey, you said you wouldn't
  laugh at it!
* Someday, I'd like to climb
  this mountain we're all
  buried under.
* Standing under the sky, looking
  at the world all around...
* That's my wish.
* Of course I won't laugh!
* ... hmmm... if I say my wish...
* You promise you won't
  laugh at me?
* I'm gonna run around in a
  huge field of flowers.
* Maybe I could jump without
  hitting my head.
* ... I wanna...
* I wanna...
* You wanna ride a train, right,
  honey?
* I'll climb this mountain
  and...
* I just want everyone to be
  happy...

  child be...?
* I've been looking all over

* ...
* Hee hee hee.
* THAT'S not true.
* She'll find another kid, and
  instantly forget about you.
* You'll NEVER see her again.
* Where am I...?
* It's so cold here...
* And so dark...
* Someone help me...
* Anyone... please...
* Help me...

Echo Flower Explainer
* This is an Echo Flower.
* It repeats the last thing

* Bahh!!!
* Nevermind!!
* So?
* What are you waiting for!?

* Nowadays "puzzles" are nothing
  but lasers and moving rocks...
* Bahh!!!
* There's no ART in that
  actiony, mindless schlock!
* It's just timing-based drivel!
* Give me something that
  challenges the deepest
  reaches of my mind...
* You!
* You're young!
* You've still got hope!
* Geh heh heh...!
* Here... try solving this
  block-pushing puzzle!
* Geh?
* Who are you?
* Freedom? What? Bah!
* You're pullin' my leg!
* You again!?
* Bah! I don't care about
  going free!
* Do you think humans could

  of classic puzzles...?
* Bah!
* What...?

* You're pushing it ALL WRONG!
* Bah, forget it!

* That dog considers itself
  an artist, but doesn't ever
  know what to create.
* It probably doesn't help
  that its brain is the size
  of a piece of kibble.
* That dog from earlier...?
* It's at Grillby's.
* I think.
* After work, all of the dogs
  go there to play cards
  together.
* But that dog doesn't really
  know how to express itself.
* So, it ends up playing alone,
  instead of introducing
  itself to the others...
* A dog just rushed in here,
  filled with inspiration.
* It kept trying to build
  a snowdog that expressed
  its own emotions...
* But, as it built, it
  kept getting more excited
  about the sculpture...
* Its neck got longer and
  longer, and it added more
  and more snow, until...
* It was rather sad to watch,
  but I couldn't turn away.
* We're all free?
* OK, OK...
* I'll stop lounging around.

* Please leave.
* You...
* You came from outside,
  didn't you?
* People like you are so
  rare...
* Please!* Stranger!
* Well, what are you
  waiting for?
* Oh!
* You're back!
* Huh?
* "SURFACE"?
* What do you mean?
* I just meant outside this
  room.
* If you haven't noticed, my
  mycelium have bound me
  to the ground.
* Please!
* Stranger!
* I'll make this simple.
* I've spent my whole life
  in the same spot,
  in the same room.
* But I've long wondered
  what lies inside the
  room to the right.
* Long I've fantasized
  about entering, and
  changing my scenery...
* No...
* Changing my LIFE!
* Please.
* Go and tell me what's
  inside.
* Is everyone out there
  like you?
* How terrible.
* Oh, that's a relief!
* That's all I need to
  continue my fantasies.
* Thank you, stranger.
* So it's the same.
* The same...
* Same...
* OK.
* As I came in, I realized I
  forgot to make a reservation.
* But I didn't want to look
  like I messed up.
* So I kept walkin' in anyway.
* Now I'm just... kinda...
* Consuming dew off this ficus.
* Oh, we're all free?
* Oh...
* Guess I can...
* Stop lickin' this ficus.
* ... but I don't want to look
  like I messed up, so
  I'll keep going...
* What would Mettaton think if
  he saw me licking this
  plant of his...?
* Eh... who cares.

* Here we go!
See that heart? 
That is your SOUL,
the very culmination
of your being!
Your SOUL starts off
weak, but can grow
strong if you gain
a lot of LV.
What's LV stand for?
Why, LOVE, of course!
You want some
LOVE, don't you?
Don't worry,
I'll share some
with you!
Down here, LOVE is
shared through...
Little white... 
"friendliness
pellets."
Are you ready?
Move around!
Get as many as
you can!
You idiot.
In this world, it's
kill or BE killed.
Why would ANYONE pass
up an opportunity
like this!?
Die.
Hey buddy,
you missed them.
Let's try again,
okay?
Is this a joke?
Are you braindead?
RUN. INTO. THE.
BULLETS!!!
You know what's
going on here,
don't you?
You just wanted to
see me suffer.
I already CHOSE
that name.
Why...?
Why did you let me go? 
Don't you realize that
being nice...
... just makes you
get hurt?
Look at yourself.
You made all these
great friends...
But now, you'll probably
never see them again.
Not to mention how
much they've been
set back by you.
Hurts, doesn't it?
If you had just gone
through without caring
about anyone...
You wouldn't have to
feel bad now.
So I don't get it.
If you really did
everything the right
way..
Why did things still
end up like this?
Why...?
Is life really
that unfair?
...
Say.
What if I told you...
I knew some way
to get you a better
ending?
You'll have to load
your SAVE file, and...
You'll have to
start over, and...
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you go see
Dr. Alphys?
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you go see
Undyne?
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you go see
Papyrus, then Undyne?
It seems like you
could have been
better friends.
Who knows... maybe
she's got the key
to your happiness...?
See you soon.
But, despite everything,
your happy ending
didn't come.
Why...?
I know why.
Go to Dr. Alphys.
Your date with her
has really just
begun.
So you went the
whole way through
without killing...
And then you decided
to kill ASGORE?
What the hell is
WRONG with you?
You COMPLETELY missed
the point.
Are you trolling me?
Because.
No.
You are only
trolling yourself.
What a waste of
everybody's time.
All you had to
do was make friends.
With Papyrus, Undyne,
and then Alphys.
But you were too
busy messing it up!
Hey.
Since you defeated me.
I've been thinking.
Is killing things
really necessary?
I...
I honestly don't
know anymore.
I have a request
for you.
Prove to me...
Prove to me you
are strong enough
to survive.
Get here from
the beginning.
Without killing a
single thing...
... and I won't
kill the king.
... and, maybe...
Then you'll have
your so-called
"happy ending."
So, what will
it be?
Will you prove
yourself?
Or will I get to
watch you suffer...?
Either way, I'm
interested!!!
Hee hee hee...
Interesting...
So, even with
everything you did...
The outcome's still
the same.
In the end, your
choices were an
illusion.
NOTHING you do
really matters!
Hee hee hee!
...
Well.
You DID do what
I told you.
I guess it's up
to me to get you a
REAL happy ending.
For starters, you
can't do it by
yourself.
Papyrus, Undyne,
Alphys... these guys.
Are you friends with
all of them yet?
Maybe you should go
back and... "hang"
with them.
The power of
friendship...
That always saves
the day, right?
So, killing people
is ACTUALLY fine...?
Sure.
I'm glad we agree on
the value of a life.
I've learned SO
MUCH from you.
Though... are you
REALLY gonna keep
doing things halfway?
The amount of people
you killed...
It's honestly
DISAPPOINTING.
You IDIOT.
You really can't do
ANYTHING right.
Why, 
...?
Why?
WHY?
We were on our way
to REAL victory...
On our way to making
up for LAST time!
Why'd you have to
SCREW IT UP?
Hahaha...
Is this REVENGE?
Making me watch you
act so pure and
happy, while I...?
Making me watch you
live out your life,
while I...?
...
No.
NO.
I KNOW what you're
doing.
You just want to see
what it's all like.
Before we TEAR IT
AWAY from them.
Ahahaha...
Genius, 
Well, I'll let you
mess around.
I know you'll come
back eventually.
And when that time
comes...
I'll be waiting
for you.
Why do you keep
coming back here?
Oh, I get it.
You wanna be friends,
huh...?
You're PATHETIC.
You REALLY think I
want to be friends
with YOU?
Heh...
You really DON'T
get it, do you?
There's only one
person I could care
about anymore.
And even then, I
couldn't TRULY care
about them.
I just like to think
there's someone out
there...
Someone that I
won't get tired of.
Someone like ME.
Quit looking at me
with that stupid
expression.
You're pissing me
off.
So you're here
again.
What's wrong with
you?
Are you trying to
start the Flowey
Fan Club?
Because if you
want to join THAT...
You'll have to
talk to Papyrus.
Yeah, he started
one.
A few different
times, anyway.
I won't lie.
He's one of the
better characters
to mess around with.
Took me a long
time to get bored
of that one.
... Yeah.
Talk to him
about it.
So.
Did you start the
Flowey Fan Club?
Ha.
I'm just kidding.
I was watching.
I know you didn't.
But I don't care.
Really.
He probably would
have invited his
garbage brother.
You know.
Smiley Trashbag.
Say.
If I have ONE piece
of advice for you...
DON'T.
Let his brother.
Find out ANYTHING
about you.
He'll... well...
Let's just say.
He's caused me more
than my fair share
of resets.
Stay away from
that guy.
Why do you keep
coming back here?
You don't REALLY
want to be friends,
do you...?
No. I get it.
You're just like me,
aren't you?
You don't care about
anyone.
You're just bored.
You just want to
see what I'll say.
So you can laugh
and throw me away
like a broken toy.
Well, TOO BAD!
I'm not LIKE everybody
else.
So, from now on...
You're not getting
ANYTHING.
Don't you have
anything BETTER to do?
Hi.
Seems as if everyone
is perfectly happy.
Monsters have returned
to the surface.
Peace and prosperity
will rule across the land.
Take a deep breath.
There's nothing left
to worry about.
...
Well.
There is one thing.
One last threat.
One being with the
power to erase
EVERYTHING...
Everything everyone's
worked so hard for.
You know who I'm
talking about, don't
you?
That's right.
I'm talking about YOU.
YOU still have the
power to reset
everything.
Toriel, Sans, Asgore,
Alphys, Papyrus, Undyne...
If you so choose...
Everyone will be
ripped from this
timeline...
... and sent back before
all of this
ever happened.
Nobody will
remember anything.
You'll be able to
do whatever you
want.
That power.
I know that power.
That's the power
you were fighting to
stop, wasn't it?
The power that I
wanted to use.
But now, the idea
of resetting
everything...
I...
I don't think I
could do it all
again.
Not after that.
So, please.
Just let them go.
Let Frisk be happy.
Let Frisk live
their life.
But.
If I can't change
your mind.
If you DO end up
erasing everything...
You have to erase
my memories, too.
I'm sorry.
You've probably heard
this a hundred times
already, haven't you...?
Well, that's all.
See you later...
.
Is this a joke?
Are you braindead?
RUN. INTO. THE.
friendliness pellets
You
IDIOT.
You
haven't
learned
a thing.
Hee
hee
hee.
So you
finally
get it.
So you
DO
recall.
In
this
world...
It's KILL or BE killed.
Hee hee hee.
Don't worry.
I know there's no
REAL point in
fighting you.
The human souls
would probably just
revolt again.
So...!
Hee hee hee.
Did you REALLY
think killing me
would make a
DIFFERENCE?
No.
Every time you
load your SAVE,
I'll come back.
And every time you
try to get a
happy ending...
I'll be there to
tear it away!
Ha ha ha!!!
Well, let's get
this over with.
See?
I never betrayed
you! 
It was all a
trick, see? 
I was waiting to
kill him for you! 
After all it's me
your best friend! 
I'm helpful, I can
be useful to you 
I promise I won't
get in your way 
I can help...
I can...
I can... 
Please don't
kill me.
I knew you had it in you!
I just can't understand...
I can't understand!
I can't understand.
... why are you being...
... so nice to me?
... why?
...?
...
I'll kill everyone you love.
I'll kill everyone.
I'll kill you.
If you let me live...
I'll come back.
Sparing me won't change
anything.
Killing me is the only
way to end this.
What are you doing?
Do you really think I've
learned anything from this?
No.
Howdy, 
You finally made
it home.
Remember when we
used to play here?
Hee hee hee...
Boy!
Today's gonna be
just as fun.
I remember when I
first woke up here,
in the garden.
I was so scared.
I couldn't feel my
arms or my legs...
My entire body had
turned into a
flower!
"Mom! Dad!
Somebody help me!"
I called out.
But nobody came.
Eventually, the king
found me, crying in
the garden.
I explained what had
happened to him.
Then he held me,
He held me with
tears in his eyes,
saying...
There, there.
Everything is going
to be alright.
He was so...
Emotional.
But...
For some reason...
I didn't feel
anything at all.
I soon realized I
didn't feel ANYTHING
about ANYONE.
My compassion had
disappeared!
And believe me,
it's not like I
wasn't trying.
I wasted weeks with
that stupid king,
vainly hoping I would
feel something.
But it became too
much for me.
I ran away from
home.
Eventually, I reached
the RUINS.
Inside I found HER,
I thought of all
people, SHE could
make me feel whole
again.
She failed.
Ha ha...
I realized those two
were useless.
I became despondent.
I just wanted to
love someone.
I just wanted to
care about someone.
, you might
not believe this...
But I decided...
It wasn't worth
living anymore.
Not in a world
without love.
Not in a world
without you.
So...
I decided to follow
in your footsteps.
I would erase myself
from existence.
And you know what?
I succeeded.
But as I left this
mortal coil...
I started to feel
apprehensive.
If you don't have
a SOUL, what happens
when you...?
Something primal
started to burn
inside me.
No, I thought.
"I don't want to
die!"
Then I woke up.
Like it was all
just a bad dream.
I was back at the
garden.
Back at my
"save point."
Interested, I decided
to experiment.
Again and again, I
brought myself to
the edge of death.
At any point, I
could have let this
world continue on
without me.
But as long as I
was determined to
live...
I could go back.
Amazing, isn't it,
I was amazed, too.
At first, I used my
powers for good.
I became "friends"
with everyone.
I solved all their
problems flawlessly.
Their companionship
was amusing...
For a while. 
As time repeated,
people proved
themselves
predictable.
What would this
person say if I
gave them this?
What would they do
if I said this to
them?
Once you know the
answer, that's it.
That's all they are.
It all started
because I was
curious.
Curious what would
happen if I killed
them.
"I don't like this,"
I told myself.
"I'm just doing this
because I HAVE to
know what happens.
Ha ha ha...
What an excuse!
You of all people
must know how
liberating it is to
act this way.
At least we're better
than those sickos
that stand around and
WATCH it happen...
Those pathetic people
that want to see it,
but are too weak to
do it themselves.
I bet someone like
that's watching right
now, aren't they...?
Nowadays, even that's
grown tiring.
You understand,
I've done everything
this world has to
offer.
I've read every book.
I've burned every
book.
I've won every game.
I've lost every game.
I've appeased
everyone.
I've killed everyone.
Sets of numbers...
Lines of dialogue...
I've seen them all.
But you...
YOU'RE different.
I never could
predict YOU, 
When I saw you in
the RUINS, I didn't
recognize you.
I thought I could
frighten you, then
steal your SOUL.
I failed.
And when I tried
to load my save
file...
It didn't work.
...
Your DETERMINATION!
Somehow, it's even
greater than mine!
I just have one
question for you,
How did you get
back to the RUINS
from here...?
... wait, I know.
She must have taken
you when she left.
And decided to give
you a proper burial,
rather than...
Hanging out in the
basement forever.
... but, why then...?
What made you wake
up?
Did you hear me
calling you...?
It doesn't matter
now.
I'm so tired of
this, 
I'm tired of all
these people.
I'm tired of all
these places.
I'm tired of being
a flower.
There's just one
thing left I want
to do.
Let's finish what we
started.
Let's free everyone.
Then... let's let
them see what
humanity is
REALLY like!
That despite it all...
This world is still
"kill or be killed!!"
Then...?
Well.
I had...
Been entertaining a
few ways to use
that power.
Hee hee hee...
But seeing you here
changed my mind.
...
I think if you're
around...
Just living in the
surface world
doesn't seem so bad.
We don't even need
to leave to get
them this time.
The king has six of
them locked away.
I've tried hundreds
of ways to get him
to show me them...
But he just won't.
I know he'll do it
for YOU.
Why am I telling
you all of this?
, I said it
before.
Even after all this
time...
You're still the
only one that
understands me.
You won't give me
any worthless pity!
Creatures like us...
Wouldn't hesitate to
KILL each other if
we got in each
other's way.
So that's...
So... that's...
Why...
... ha...
Ha...
... what's this...
... feeling?
Why am I...
Shaking?
Hey... 
...
No hard feelings about
back then, right?
H-Hey, what are you
doing!?
B... back off!!
I... I've changed
my mind about all
this.
This isn't a good
idea anymore.
Y-you should go back,
This place is fine
the way it is!
S-s-stop making that
creepy face!
This isn't funny!
You've got a SICK
sense of humor!
Hey.
What's the hold
up!?
Shouldn't she be
dead by now!?
I've been waiting
in that room for...
... Hard mode...?
Gee, you better
take a picture.
People are gonna
think you're REALLY
cool.
... NOT!
Golly, talk about
a tryhard.
PA. THE. TIC.
Uh, so, are you
gonna keep going,
or...?
Hahaha!
I KNEW that!
Why does everyone
have to be so
condescending!?
So what's YOUR
excuse?
Sitting around
here...?
Don't you have
anything better to
* Hee hee hee...
* Why'd you make me
  introduce myself?
* It's rude to act
  like you don't
  know who I am.
* Someone ought to teach
  you proper manners.
* Don't you have anything
  better to do?
* Error
* Really, 
* Well, do what you
  will.
* I'll be waiting for
  you!
* Hey.
* Remember.
* DON'T kill anyone.
* I can't believe this
  is a REAL thing I
  have to remind you.
* Hee hee hee...
* Good luck!
* Remember...
* THIS time, you've
  GOT to become friends
  with everyone.
* OK?
* If you DON'T, you'll
  be miserable FOREVER.
* And we wouldn't want
  THAT, would we?
* No...
* We just want you
  to be happy, right?
* Good luck. 
* I hope you like your
  choice.
* After all, it's not
  as if you can go
  back and change fate.
* In this world, it's kill
  or be killed.
* That old hag thought
  she could break the
  rules.
* She tried so hard
  to save you humans.
* But when it came
  down to it...
* Hee hee...
* SHE COULDN'T EVEN
  SAVE HERSELF.
* WHAT AN IDIOT!!
* Heheheheh.
* You just can't
  get enough, can you!?
* How many more
  times will you
  kill her?
* Ha ha ha ha ha...
* You disgusting animal.
* You didn't even
  TRY to spare her.
* Wow, you really
  can't get enough.
* You kind of remind
  me of myself.
* Wow, you're utterly
  repulsive.
* You spared her life...
* Then you decided that
  just wasn't interesting
  enough for you.
* So you murdered her
  just to see what
  would happen.
* You killed her out
  of boredom.
* Truly disgusting...
* Hee hee...
* You naive idiot.
* Do you think you
  are the only one
  with that power?
* The power to reshape
  the world...
* Purely by your
  own determination.
* The ability to
  play God!
* The ability to "SAVE."
* I thought I was
  the only one with
  that power. But...
* I can't SAVE anymore.
* Apparently YOUR
  desires for this
  world override MINE.
* Well well.
* Enjoy that power
  while you can.
* I'll be watching.
* Hahaha...
* You're not really human,
  are you?
* No. You're empty inside.
* Just like me.
* In fact...
* You're 
, right?
* We're still inseperable,
  after all these years...
* Listen.
* I have a plan to become
  all powerful.
* Even more powerful than
  you and your stolen
  soul.
* Let's destroy everything
  in this wretched world.
* Everyone, everything in
  these worthless
  memories...
* Let's turn 'em all
  to dust.
* Clever.
* Verrrryyy clever.
* You think you're really
  smart, don't you?
* So you were able to
  play by your own
  rules.
* You spared the life
  of a single person.
* Froggit, Whimsun.
* Vegetoid, Loox.
* Migosp, Moldsmal.
* Think about those names.
* Do you think any of
  those monsters have
  families?
* Do you think any of
  them have friends?
* Each one could have
  been someone else's
  Toriel.
* Selfish brat.
* Somebody is dead
  because of you.
* I bet you feel
  really great.
* You didn't kill
  anybody this time.
* But what will you
  do if you meet a
  relentless killer?
* You'll die and you'll
  die and you'll
  die.
* Until you tire of
  trying.
* What will you do
  then?
* Will you kill
  out of frustration?
* Or will you give
  up entirely on
  this world...
* ... and let ME inherit
  the power to control
  it?
* I am the prince of
  this world's future.
* Don't worry, my little
  monarch, my plan
  isn't regicide.
* This is SO much
  more interesting.
* But don't act so
  cocky.
* I know what you did.
* You murdered her.
* And then you went
  back, because you
  regretted it.
* Ha ha ha ha...
* You naive idiot.
You IDIOTS.
While you guys were
having your little
pow-wow...
I took the human
SOULS!
And now, not only
are THOSE under my
power...
But all of your
FRIENDS' SOULS are
gonna be mine, too!
Hee hee hee.
And you know what
the best part is?
It's all your
fault.
It's all because
you MADE THEM
love you.
All the time you
spent listening to
them...
Encouraging them...
Caring about them...
Without that, they
wouldn't have come
here.
And now, with their
souls and the humans'
together...
I will achieve my
REAL FORM.
Hee hee...
Huh?
WHY am I still
doing this?
Don't you get it?
This is all just
a GAME.
If you leave the
underground satisfied,
you'll "win" the
game.
If you "win," you
won't want to "play"
with me anymore.
And what would I
do then?
But this game
between us will
NEVER end.
I'll hold victory
in front of you,
just within your
reach...
And then tear it
away just before
you grasp it.
Over, and over,
and over...
Hee hee hee.
Listen.
If you DO defeat
me, I'll give you
your "happy ending."
I'll bring your
friends back.
I'll destroy the
barrier.
Everyone will
finally be
satisfied.
But that WON'T
happen.
You...!
I'll keep you here
no matter what!
Even if it means
killing you
1,000,000 times!!!!
What?
Urrrgh... NO!
Unbelievable!!
This can't be
happening...!
You... YOU...!
I can't believe
you're all so
STUPID.
ALL OF YOUR SOULS
ARE MINE!!!
Fox Head
* The door leading through
  the area is closed?
* So I tried the puzzle?
* But I kept running out of
  ammo, and it kept restarting?
* And my two co-workers won't
  help? It's like they don't
  even wanna go to work?
* Why don't you try?
* Try using the console?
* Wow?
* You solved it?
* I'm impressed?
* You must be a total nerd?
* So we're all gonna go

  get to go to work?

* (You had better hope you do
  not encounter a banana-themed
  monster.)
* (Huh? It's rather inconvenient
  that you changed your mind
  like this.)
* (Since I told everyone
  not to use yellow names,
  everyone threw theirs out.)
* (This is really troubling...)
* (Hmmm...)
* (Well, last year it was
  fashionable to have ppink 
  names.)
* (I think everyone still
  has those in their closets
  somewhere...)
* (I'll ask everyone to look.)
* (But this is the last time!)
* Ribbit, ribbit...
* (I hope you're satisfied.)
Ribbit,

Croak,

Hop,

Shiver,

A long time ago,
a human fell
into the RUINS.
Injured by its
fall, the human
called out for
help.
You're going
to be free.
* Ribbit, ribbit.
* (Excuse me, human.)
* (I have some advice
  for you about battling
  monsters.)
* (If you ACT a certain way
  or FIGHT until you
  almost defeat them...)
* (They might not want to
  battle you anymore.)
* (If a monster does not
  want to fight you, please...)
* (Use some MERCY, human.)
* Ribbit.
* (The monsters in this world
  are very dangerous and
  aggressive.)
* (In this place, running away
  will not work on the
  first turn.)
* (It may be better to try
  another option.)
* Ribbit.
* (You seem like you have
  grown into a thoughtful and
  conscientious person.)
* (Whether that was from my
  advice or not...)
* (I'm quite proud.)
* Ribbit.
* Ribbit, ribbit.
* (Just between you and me...)
* (I saw TORIEL come out of
  here just a little
  while ago.)
* (She was carrying some
  groceries.)
* (I didn't ask what they
  were for...)
* (We're all too intimidated
  to talk to her.)
* Ribbit.
* Ribbit, ribbit.
* (Seems like the RUINS have
  finally opened up.)
* (Maybe we should finally
  go out to the rest of
  the underground.)
* (Huh? The barrier's open,
  too...?)
* (... let's just take this
  one step at a time, OK?)
* (Normally, she carries
  groceries out of here.)
* (But this time, she wasn't
  carrying anything.)
* (She looked disappointed.)
* Ribbit.
* Ribbit ribbit.
* (I heard using "F4" can make
  you have a "full screen.")
* (But what does "F4" stand for?)
* ("Four frogs"?)
* (I have only seen a maximum of
  three frogs in this room...)
* (This is troubling, to say
  the least.)
* Ribbit.
* Ribbit ribbit.
* (Did you ever find this
  room's fourth frog?)
* Ribbit ribbit.
* (Yellow names were nice for
  a while.)
* (Next time, we should try a
  relaxing shade of green.)
* Ribbit ribbit.
* (How was your adventure?)
* (It must have been difficult
  without being able to tell
  the enemy's feelings.)
* Ribbit ribbit.
* (Finally, we can all remove
  these aging pink names.)
* (Everyone gave you a big favor
  today.)
* (Try to respect that!)
* Ribbit, ribbit.
* (Sigh...)
* (My friend never listens to
  me.)
* (Whenever I talk, they skip
  through my words by pressing
  [X].)
* (That's right.......)
* (Pressing [X]............)
* (................)
* (Well, at least you listen
  to me.)
* Ribbit, ribbit.
* (Say...)
* (Now that your journey's
  over, maybe you'll have
  time to listen to me.)
* (Since most people just
  press [X] to skip through
  my dialogue.)
* (You've really matured,
  haven't you?)
* (Oh, not you too!)
* (... I suppose some things
  never change.)
Ribbit.
Froggit and Frisk
* (What do you think of that?)
         Very        It's
         Helpful     Bad
Fuku Fire
* Finally!
* Someone turned off that laser!
* Now that we're free we can...
* Well, uh, I guess we'll just
  keep standing here.
* Hm?
* Nice try, but your loitering
  technique still needs work.
* There will be lots of places
  to loiter on the surface,
  I bet.
* Loitering around...
* What's the point?

Gaster Follower 1
* It makes sense why ASGORE
  took so long to hire a
  new Royal Scientist.
* After all, the old one...
* Dr. Gaster.
* What an act to follow!
* They say he created the CORE.
* However, his life...
* Was cut short.
* One day, he fell into
  his creation, and...
* Will Alphys end up the
  same way?
Gaster Follower 2
* Alphys might work faster.
* But the old Royal Scientist,
  Doctor W.D. Gaster?
* One day, he vanished
  without a trace.
* They say he shattered
  across time and space.
* Ha ha...
* How can I say so
  without fear?
* I'm holding a piece of
  him right here.
Gaster Follower 3
* I understand why ASGORE
  waited so long to hire a
  new Royal Scientist.
* The previous one...
* Dr. Gaster.
* His brilliance was
  irreplaceable.
* One day, his experiments
  went wrong, and...
* Well, I needn't gossip.
* After all, it's rude to
  talk about someone who's
  listening.
Gerson
Wah ha ha! Why not?
* Woah there!
* I've got some neat
  junk for sale.
* Wah ha ha!
* I knew you could
  do it!
* Wa ha ha...
* So you came here.
* What a treat!
What are
you lookin
for?
Thanks!
Wa ha ha.
Careful
with that.
You're
a bit
short
on cash.
You're
carrying
too much!
Don't
expect a
discount.
Here we
are.
Eh?
You can't
afford
it?
Don't you
have
enough?
Anything
you
wanna
know?
Really?
YOU
wanna
chat?
* Ha! 
* I'm tryin' to get RID of
  my junk, not get more of it!
* Though, I've heard if you
  want to sell stuff, the Temmie
  Village is your best bet.
* Where is it?
* I don't remember.
* For the last time, I'm not
  taking it!
* I wouldn't buy your chitzy
  garbage at knifepoint.
* Be careful out there, kid!
* Good riddance.
* I've been around a long time.
* Maybe too long.
* Studying history sure is
  easy when you've lived through
  so much of it yourself!
* Wa ha ha!
* Long ago, ASGORE and I
  agreed that escaping would
  be pointless...
* Since once we left, humans
  would just kill us.
* I felt a little betrayed when
  he eventually changed his
  mind.
* But now, I think...
* Maybe he was right to.
* 'Cause after all, even though
  we never escaped...
* A human's killing us anyway,
  ain't that right?
* OK, OK!
* I remember it clearly now.
* It was the monthly address at
  the castle, and the queen
  was giving her part on
  current events.
* After finishing her update,
  she moved to pass the
  microphone to the king.
* However, she didn't realize
  the microphone was still in
  her hands when she said:
* "Your turn, Fluffybuns."
* The audience burst into
  laughter.
* Realizing what she had said,
  she started laughing too.
* After a few moments, the
  king held up his arms.
* The crowd grew silent.
* He leaned towards the
  microphone, expression...
* Stern.
* "Dear citizens."
* "Thank you for coming
  here today."
* "I... King Fluffybuns..."
* And the rest is history.
* What's that?
* You want me to repeat myself?
* Heck no!
* Your eyes still work...
* Go read a book or something!
* Wahaha!
* Oh yeah...
* The prophecy.
* Legend has it, an 'angel' who has
  seen the surface will descend
  from above and bring us freedom.
* Lately, the people have been
  taking a bleaker outlook...
* Callin' that winged circle the
  'Angel of Death.'
* A harbinger of destruction,
  waitin' to 'free' us from
  this mortal realm...
* In my opinion, when I see
  that little circle...
* I jus' think it looks neat!
* Wahaha!
* That emblem actually predates
  written history.
* The original meaning has been
  lost to time...
* All we know is that the
  triangles symbolize us monsters
  below, and the winged circle
  above symbolizes...
* Somethin' else.
* Most people say it's the
  'angel,' from the prophecy...
* Eh?
* You don't know what that is?
* What are they teaching you
  kids in school nowadays...?
* Wa ha ha!
* That's the Delta Rune, the
  emblem of our kingdom.
* The Kingdom...
* ... of Monsters.
* Wahaha!
* Great name, huh?
* It's as I always say...
* Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name
  for beans!
* Eh?
* Goat?
* Actually, that reminds me.
* Toriel once wore a flower-
  patterned muu-muu... 
* Folks kept saying "nice muu-
  muu" to her, but she kept
  thinking they were calling
  her a cow.
* So she never wore it again.
* What was the question again?
* Oh.
* Right.
* ASGORE.
* He's a real interesting
  type of monster.
* The strongest type of all.
* We call 'em Boss Monsters.
* When they have an offspring,
  the SOUL power of the
  parents flows into the
  child...
* Causing the child to grow
  as the parents age.
* But ASGORE doesn't have a
  child.
* So he's been stuck at the
  same age...
* And probably will be forever.
* Huh?
* What if the child is a
  human...? What?
* Nah. That wouldn't work.
* So if ASGORE's your father,
  he'll definitely outlive
  you.
* I've lived too long to
  be afraid of something
  like you.
* Try it, kiddo!
* ... I know you can't here.
* Wah ha...
* Knowledge like that is
  the only reason I've
  survived so long.
* King Fluffybuns?
* He's a friendly, happy-go-lucky
  kind of guy...
* If you keep walking around long
  enough, you'll probably meet him.
* He loves to walk around and
  talk to people.
* Eh?
* Why do I call Dreemurr
  'Fluffybuns?'
* Oh, that's a great story!
* I don't remember it.
* But if you come back much
  later, I'm sure I'll have
  remembered by then.
* Oh yeah!
* Of course.
* Toriel was queen, and
  Asgore was the king.
* It was tragic when she left.
* Since everyone knew she was
  really the brains behind the
  throne...
* But it was also just a
  teensy, teensy bit relieving,
  you know?
* Those two were really
  insufferable together...
* Nuzzling noses, bein' all cute
  n' cuddly in public...
* Embarrassing their children...
* They were so sweet it
  made me SICK.
* Thank god those days are
  over!
* Eh? Fight you?
* Nah... I'm not a hero.
* Never was.
* And b'sides...
* These old bones aren't fit
  for fighting anyhoo.
* One attack from you, and
  then I'd... well...
* At least by talking to
  you, I've bought enough time
  for some of them to escape.
* Undyne?
* Yeah, she's a local hero
  around here.
* Through grit and determination
  alone, she fought her way to
  the top of the Royal Guard.
* Actually, she just came through
  here asking about someone who
  looked just like you...
* I'd watch your back, kid.
* And buy some items...
* It might just save your hide!
* Wa ha ha!
* Undyne.
* She's really come a long way
  since she was a little
  urchin.
* I used to be a hero myself,
  back in the old days.
* Gerson, the Hammer of Justice.
* When she was younger, Undyne
  would follow me around, to
  watch me beat up bad guys...
* Sometimes she'd even try
  to help!
* Though, most of the time
  the folks she attacked weren't
  bad guys.
* It'd be the mailman or
  something like that.
* Anyhoo, I appreciated it!
* Wah ha ha ha!!!
* I'm not a hero.
* But I know there's someone
  out there.
* Someone who'll never give
  up trying to do the
  right thing, no matter
  what.
* There's no prophecy or
  legend 'bout anyone like
  that.
* It's just something I know
  is true.
* That someone like that
  will strike you down.
Gift Bear
* Awful teens tormented
  a local monster by decorating
  its tree-like horns.
* So we started giving that
  monster presents to make it
  feel better.
* Now it's a tradition to put
  presents underneath a decorated
  tree.
* Guess it was a good thing
  those teens tormented that
  monster...?
* Hmm?
* Adjusting the presents is
  my responsibility.
* Nah, to be honest, I
  just keep looking to see
  if I've gotten one...
* It'll be nice to show humans
  our presents-under-the-tree
  tradition.
* They'll probably be weirded
  out by it.
* You know what's cute?
* Those two married dogs
  always put presents under
  the tree for each other.
* It's always the same.
* A single bone.
* But every time, they act
  like it's the first time
  they've gotten it.
* Then Papyrus comes to take
  his bones back.
* Anyway, where are those
  two...?
* That's strange.
* There was a present here
  for Papyrus...
* Now it's gone.
* Did someone steal it?

* That moment of unbridled
  emotion.
* It allowed me to finally
  fuse with my body!
* I'm fully corporeal now!
* My lifelong dream, realized!
* In return, I guess I
  won't stomp you.
* How's that sound?
* Sorry for acting like a

Mad Dummy
OWWWW, you
DUMMIES!!
Watch where you're
aiming your MAGIC 
attacks!
Hey!
You! Forget
I said anything
about MAGIC!!!
Foolish.
Foolish!
FOOLISH!
Even if you attack
my vessel, you'll
NEVER hurt me!
I'm still
incorporeal, you
DUMMY!!!
Foolish.
Foolish!
FOOLISH!
Futile.
Futile!
FUTILE!
Pitiful.
Pitiful!
PITIFUL!
Feeble.
Feeble!
FEEBLE!
 I'll defeat you and
 take your SOUL!
 I'll use your SOUL
 to cross the barrier!
 I'll stand in the
 window of a fancy
 store!
 THEN EVERYTHING I
 WANT WILL BE MINE!
 Huh?
 Yeah, I guess
 that'll avenge my
 cousin.
 What was their name
 again...?
 Whatever.
 Whatever!
 WHATEVER!!
DUMMY
BOTS!
MAGIC
MISSILE!
DUMMY
BOTS!
TRY
AGAIN!
DUMMY
BOTS!
You're
awful???
DUMMY
BOTS!
FINAL
ATTACK!
 (Wait, is DUMMY
 a compliment...?)
HEY GUYS!
Dummies.
Dummies!
DUMMIES!
Remember how I
said NOT to
shoot at me?
Well...
FAILURES!
YOU'RE FIRED!
YOU'RE ALL BEING
REPLACED!!!
Hahaha.
Hahaha!
HAHAHA!
Now you'll see
my true power:
Relying on people
that aren't garbage!
(N... no way!)
(These guys are
even WORSE than
the other guys!)
Who cares.
Who cares!
WHO CARES!!
I DON'T NEED
FRIENDS!!!
I'VE GOT
KNIVES!!!
I'm...
Out of knives.
BUT IT DOESN'T
MATTER!!!
YOU CAN'T HURT
ME AND I CAN'T
HURT YOU!
YOU'LL BE STUCK
FIGHTING ME...
Forever.
Forever!
FOREVER!!!!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Wh...
What the heck is
this!?
Ergh!
Acid rain!?!
Oh, FORGET IT!
I'm outta here!
The humans
attacked him
with everything
they had.
He was struck
with blow after
blow.
ASRIEL had the
power to destroy
them all.
* Hahaha...
* It's just like you to
  run away.
* FOOL!
* You think you can hurt
  ME???
* Hahaha...
* Too intimidated to fight
  me, huh!?
* I am a ghost that lives
  inside a DUMMY.
* My cousin used to live
  inside a DUMMY, too.
* Until...
* YOU CAME ALONG!
* They were a shy sort.
* Living a lonely life in
  the RUINS...
* They saw you and hoped you
  might TALK to them.
* Perhaps strike up a
  friendly conversation.
* But NO!!!
* You ran away...
* And broke their little
  ethereal heart.
* Despicable.
* Despicable!
* DESPICABLE!
* HUMAN!
* I'll show you what REAL
  heartbreak is!
* YOU DESTROYED THEIR HOME!
* Us ghosts spend our whole
  lives looking for a
  proper vessel.
* Slowly, slowly, we grow
  closer to our new
  bodies...
* Until one day, we too
  may become corporeal
  beings.
* Beings able to laugh,
  love, and dance like
  any other...
* But YOU!!!!
* My cousin's future...!
* You took it all away!
* HUMAN!
* I hope you're not too
  attached to YOUR body...
* Because your SOUL's about
  to get EVICTED!!!
* When you talked to them,
  they thought they were
  in for a nice chat...
* But the things you
  SAID...!
* Horrible.
* Shocking!
* UNBELIEVABLE!
* It spooked them right
  out of their dummy!
* HUMAN!
* I'll scare your SOUL
  out of your body!
* YOU...!
* You...
* Shucks!
* You were really boring!
* They got annoyed and flew
  away like any self-
  respecting spectre.
* Well then.
* Well then!
* WELL THEN!
* Boring people are crumbs
  sticking to the face
  of this world.
* Human!
* I'll wipe you away with
  the dainty handkerchief
  of vengeance!
* Not only did YOUR actions
  cause them to leave their
  home...
* But now all of their neighbors
  are gone, too!
* Despicable.
* Despicable!
* DESPICABLE!!!
* You're the worst person I've
  ever met!
* I've NEVER been more mad!!!
* Guooooohhhh!!!!
* My mannequin levels are
  going OFF THE CHARTS!!!
* What.
* What?
* WHAT!?
* It's a living.
* So, you helped get us
  all free...
* I guess I really acted
  like a dummy to you.

Long ago, two races
ruled over Earth:
HUMANS and MONSTERS.   
One day, war broke
out between the two
races.   
After a long battle,
the humans were
victorious.   
They sealed the monsters
underground with a magic
spell.   
Many years later...

* WHAT A SENSATIONAL OPPORTUNITY
  FOR A STORY!
* I CAN SEE THE HEADLINE NOW:
* "A DOG EXISTS SOMEWHERE."
* FRANKLY, I'M BLOWN AWAY.
* THIS DOG...
* STILL EXISTS!
* THIS STORY...
* JUST KEEPS GETTING
  BETTER AND BETTER!
* OH MY!!!!
* ... IT'S A COMPLETELY
  NONDESCRIPT GLASS OF WATER.
* BUT ANYTHING CAN MAKE
  A GREAT STORY WITH ENOUGH
  SPIN!
* I'M HONORED TO BE IN THE
  PRESENCE OF SUCH A HUGE
  LUKEWARM WATER FAN, FOLKS!
* OH NO!!!
* THAT MOVIE SCRIPT!!!
* HOW'D??? THAT GET THERE???
* IT'S A SUPER-JUICY SNEAK
  PREVIEW OF MY LATEST
  GUARANTEED-NOT-TO-BOMB FILM:
* METTATON THE MOVIE XXVIII...
  STARRING METTATON!
* I'VE HEARD THAT LIKE THE
  OTHER FILMS...
* IT CONSISTS MOSTLY OF A SINGLE
  FOUR-HOUR SHOT OF ROSE PETALS
  SHOWERING ON MY RECLINING BODY.
* OOH!!!
* BUT THAT'S!!!
* NOT CONFIRMED!!
* YOU WOULDN'T (COUGH) SPOIL MY
  MOVIE FOR EVERYONE WITH A
  PROMOTIONAL STORY, WOULD YOU?
* PHEW!!! THAT WAS CLOSE!!
* YOU ALMOST GAVE ME A BUNCH
  OF FREE ADVERTISEMENT!!
 
* OH!
* YOU'RE BACK!
* THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS!
* IT SEEMS NO ONE CAN RESIST
  THE ALLURE OF MY NEW FILM!
* BASKETBALL'S A BLAST, ISN'T IT,
  DARLING?
* TOO BAD YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH
  THESE BALLS.
* THEY'RE MTT-BRAND FASHION
  BASKETBALLS.
* FOR WEARING, NOT PLAYING.
* YOU CAN'T GET RICH AND FAMOUS
  LIKE MOI WITHOUT BEAUTIFYING
  A FEW ORBS.
* IT SEEMS OUR REPORTER IS DRAWN
  TO SPORTS LIKE MOTHS TO A
  FLAMING BASKETBALL HOOP.
* OH MY! IT'S A PRESENT!
* AND IT'S ADDRESSED TO YOU,
  DARLING!
* AREN'T YOU JUST BURSTING
  WITH EXCITEMENT?
* WHAT COULD BE INSIDE?
* WELL, NO TIME LIKE THE
  "PRESENT" TO FIND OUT!
* READY FOR YOUR...
* PRESENTATION?
* (... LET'S CUT THAT ONE IN
  POST.)
* OOH LA LA!
* THIS VIDEO GAME YOU FOUND...
* IS DYNAMITE!!!
* THOUGH I DON'T MAKE AN
  APPEARANCE IN IT UNTIL
  THREE-FOURTHS IN.
* BUT I LIKE THAT.
* APPEARING FROM THE HEAVENS LIKE
  MANNA, SLAKING THE AUDIENCE'S
  HUNGER FOR GORGEOUS ROBOTS...
* OOH!
* THAT'S METTATON!
* AH, YOU UNDERSTAND.
* THIS IS A GAME WHERE YOU
  SHOULD CHECK EVERYTHING
  TWICE.
* ... MY ONE TRUE LOVE?
* (YOU LOOK BORED, DARLING.)
* (I WANT THIS TO BE A STELLAR
  PERFORMANCE, SO IF YOU
  WON'T GIVE IT YOUR ALL...)
* (THEN I'LL SKIP AHEAD FOR
  THE AUDIENCE'S SAKE.)
* (UNDERSTOOD.)
* (LET'S KNOCK 'EM DEAD!)
* (KA-SIGH...)
* (THE SHOW MUST GO ON!)
OOOOH!!! ARE YOU
PROMOTING MY BRAND?
LET'S START WITH
AN EASY ONE!!
HERE'S YOUR TERRIFIC
PRIZE!
ENOUGH ABOUT YOU.
LET'S TALK ABOUT ME!
HERE'S ANOTHER EASY
ONE FOR YOU!
DON'T 'COUNT'
ON YOUR VICTORY...
LET'S PLAY MEMORY
GAME.
BUT CAN YOU GET
THIS ONE???
HERE'S A SIMPLE
ONE.
TIME TO BREAK OUT
THE BIG GUNS!!
THIS IS IT, DARLING!
SAY GOODBYE!
HA!
THAT BUTTON WON'T
SAVE YOU NOW, DARLING!
YOU WOULDN'T DARE
USE THE [ACT] COMMAND
AND PRESS THAT
BUTTON!
THAT'S RIGHT!
DON'T PRESS IT!
I'LL DESTROY YOU!
WITHOUT THAT BUTTON,
YOU ARE INCHING
CLOSER AND CLOSER
TO YOUR DEMISE!
ANY MINUTE NOW!
    
ANY... MINUTE...
....NOW!
.............
............
..........
...(COUGH)
OH!!!
THAT YELLOW GLOW...!
TOOK YOU LONG
ENOUGH!
* No on e cares.
IS THAT YOUR PHONE?
YOU'D BETTER ANSWER
IT!
OOOH!
OOOOOOOH!
YOU'VE DEFEATED ME!!
HOW CAN THIS BE,
YOU WERE STRONGER
THAN I THOUGHT, ETC.
WHATEVER.
YES, I WAS THE ONE
THAT RE-ARRANGED
THE CORE!
I WAS THE ONE THAT
HIRED EVERYONE TO
KILL YOU!
THAT, HOWEVER, WAS A
SHORT-SIGHTED PLAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
BE A HUNDRED TIMES
BETTER?
KILLING YOU MYSELF!!
LISTEN, DARLING.
I'VE SEEN YOU FIGHT.
YOU'RE WEAK.
IF YOU CONTINUE
FORWARD, ASGORE WILL
TAKE YOUR SOUL.
AND WITH YOUR SOUL,
ASGORE WILL DESTROY
HUMANITY.
BUT IF I GET YOUR
SOUL, I CAN STOP
ASGORE'S PLAN!
I CAN SAVE HUMANITY
FROM DESTRUCTION!
THEN, USING YOUR SOUL,
I'LL CROSS THROUGH
THE BARRIER...
AND BECOME THE STAR
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF BEING!
HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS...
NO!
MILLIONS OF HUMANS
WILL WATCH ME!
GLITZ! GLAMOUR!
I'LL FINALLY HAVE
IT ALL!
SO WHAT IF A FEW
PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE?
THAT'S SHOW BUSINESS,
BABY!
OH???
A MIRROR???
RIGHT, I HAVE TO
LOOK PERFECT FOR
OUR GRAND FINALE!
HMMM...
I DON'T SEE IT...
WHERE IS IT...?
DID YOU.
JUST FLIP.
MY SWITCH?
THAT WORTHLESS PEA-
SHOOTER WON'T WORK
ON ME, DARLING.  
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT ACTING IS!? 
HAHAHA, YOU WISH!
WRONG!
WRONG! IF ONLY ALPHYS
COULD HELP!
NOPE! TOO BAD ALPHYS
CAN'T HELP!
WRONG!!! WRONG!!!
WROOOOOOOONG!!

BOY, THAT'S

LUCKY TODAY!!!
I'M SO FLATTERED YOU
REMEMBERED!
GREAT ANSWER!
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
OF COURSE THAT
WAS EASY FOR YOU!
ALPHYS,
ALPHYS,
ALPHYS.
YOU AREN'T HELPING
OUR CONTESTANT,
ARE YOU?
OOOOOOH!!!
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME.
I'LL ASK A
QUESTION...
YOU'LL BE SURE
TO KNOW THE
ANSWER TO!
ALPHYS, ALPHYS,
ALPHYS.
SEE, ALPHYS?
I TOLD YOU IT
WAS OBVIOUS.
EVEN THE HUMAN
FIGURED IT OUT.
YES, SHE SCRAWLS
HER NAME IN THE
MARGINS OF HER
NOTES.
SHE NAMES PROGRAMMING
VARIABLES AFTER
HER.
fsgsfgsx
SHE EVEN WRITES
STORIES OF THEM
TOGETHER...
SHARING A DOMESTIC
LIFE.
PROBABILITY OF
CRUSH:
101 PERCENT.
MARGIN OF ERROR.
ONE PERCENT.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
OUTFIT AN
AMUSEMENT ROBOT...
WITH BRUTAL COMBAT
CAPABILITIES?
SIMPLE.
TO IMPRESS MR.
ASGORE DREEMURR,
OF COURSE!
OR AS ALPHYS
CALLS HIM...
MR. DREAMY.
THOSE STRONG ARMS...
THAT LUSTROUS
BEARD...
LIKE ALL THOSE WHO
CREATE WEAPONS.
SHE CRAVES THE
TENDER EMBRACE OF
A BURLY MAN.
CAN SHE TRULY
BE BLAMED?
... SERIOUSLY?
MY MY...
HOW CONCEITED CAN
YOU GET...?
I LOVE IT!
AND WHILE YOU ARE
COMPLETELY WRONG,
YOU DESERVE SOME
CREDIT.
I'VE SEEN HER WATCH

(Dance with me, darling.)
(Oh! The audience can feel
your passion!)
(Show the audience
your passion!)
(So close... How passionate...)
(... do you need some help?)
(... what ARE you doing?)
(Don't stop now!)
(Look at you, leaping around
the stage...)
(Can't keep your hands off, huh?)
(Is that how humans dance?)
(Humans are stranger
than I thought.)
(Oh! They're really
getting into it.)
(Moving so far...)
(Who can blame you?)
(Hmmm, I'll have to get used
to it...)
(Even better than
I thought...)
(So that's wha 
it's like.)
(Dancing with... A human.)
(What a shame...)
* COULD IT BE...?
* ... MY ONE TRUE LOVE?
Monster King       
Forbids your stay  
Humans must       
Live far apart    
Even if             
It breaks my heart  
They'll put you    
In the dungeon     
It'll suck         
And then you'll
die a lot  
Really sad         
You're gonna die     
Cry cry cry      
So sad it's
happening.       
* SO SAD.
* SO SAD THAT YOU ARE
  GOING TO THE DUNGEON.
* OOMPH!
* I AM SO OVERWHELMED WITH
  TRAGEDIES.
* THE KING HAS ORDERED YOU
  TO WASTE AWAY IN THE CASTLE
  BASEMENT.
* AND BEFORE WE EVEN HAD
  TIME TO SING A SWEET
  SONG ABOUT IT.
* MY DEAR HEART!
* I CAN BARELY LOOK UPON YOU,
  KNOWING WHAT COMES NEXT...
* WELL, TOODLES!
Oh my love
Has fallen
down
Now in tears
We all will
drown
Colored
tiles
Make them
a fool
If only they
Still knew
the rules
Well that
was
A sorry try
Now let's
watch
Them fry
* OH NO!
* WHATEVER SHALL I DO?
* MY LOVE HAS BEEN CAST AWAY
  INTO THE DUNGEON.
* A DUNGEON WITH A PUZZLE SO
  DASTARDLY, MY PARAMOUR WILL
  SURELY PERISH!
* O, HEAVENS HAVE MERCY!
* THE HORRIBLE COLORED TILE
  MAZE!
* EACH COLORED TILE HAS ITS
  OWN SADISTIC FUNCTION.
* FOR EXAMPLE, A GREEN TILE
  SOUNDS A NOISE, AND THEN
  YOU MUST FIGHT A MONSTER.
* RED TILES WILL...
* ACTUALLY, WAIT A SECOND.
* DIDN'T WE SEE THIS PUZZLE
  ABOUT A HUNDRED ROOMS
  AGO?
* THAT'S RIGHT.
* YOU REMEMBER ALL THE
  RULES, DON'T YOU?
* GREAT...
* THEN I WON'T WASTE YOUR
  TIME REPEATING THEM!!
* OH, AND YOU'D BETTER HURRY.
* BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET
  THROUGH IN 30 SECONDS...
* YOU'LL BE INCINERATED BY
  THESE JETS OF FIRE!!
* AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
* AHAHA... HA... HA!
* MY POOR LOVE!
* I'M SO FILLED WITH GRIEF,
  I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!
* GOOD LUCK, DARLING!

* PUZZLE?

* ALPHYS, DARLING, WHAT ARE YOU
  TALKING ABOUT...?
* DID YOU FORGET WHAT THE
  GREEN TILES DO?
* THEY MAKE A SOUND, THEN
  YOU HAVE TO FIGHT A MONSTER.
* WELL, DARLING...
* THAT MONSTER...
* IS ME!!
* WELL, DARLING...!
* WELL, WELL, WELL.
* WELL, WELL, WELL.
* WELLY WELL WELL.
* WELL WELLY WELL WELL,
  WELL WELL WELLY.
* YOU NEVER STEPPED ON A
  GREEN TILE.
* AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.
* CONGRATULATIONS!
* YOU MADE IT THROUGH THE
  PUZZLE!!!
* AND NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
  THE FLAMES WILL BE DEACTIVATED!
* NO!
* MORE!
* FIRE!
* ... BUT IT'S AS THE PHRASE
  GOES.
* "OUT OF THE FIRE, AND INTO
  THE FRYING PAN."
* THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING!
* EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO BEAT
  THE HEAT...
* YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
  WITHSTAND MY HOT METAL
  BODY!
* PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MY 
* THE HUMAN FINISHED THE PUZZLE.
* I ALREADY TURNED OFF THE
  FLAMES.
* IN FACT, I WAS ABOUT TO
  FIGHT THE HUMAN.
* ON THE ROPES?
* HA!
* I ONLY DEACTIVATED THE
  FLAMES KNOWING THAT ALPHYS
  WOULD HAVE ANYWAY.
* ... NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

* YOU UGLY LITTLE CREATURE.
* YOU'VE MADE QUITE A NAME
  FOR YOURSELF.
* SUCH INFAMY...!
* I'M IMPRESSED.
* OH. YES.
* IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ALPHYS,
  SHE'S NOT HERE.
* WHILE YOU WERE BUSY DOING
  YOUR, AHEM, THING...
* SHE WAS RUNNING AROUND
  EVACUATING PEOPLE TO SAFETY.
* NOW THEY'RE IN A PLACE
  WHERE YOU'LL NEVER GET TO
  THEM.
* DECIDING NOT TO FIGHT YOU.
* MY MY, SHE REALLY IS THE
  ONLY SMART ONE, ISN'T SHE?
* OH?
* HOW SASSY.
* YOU'RE JUST ITCHING TO GET
  YOUR HANDS ON ME, AREN'T
  YOU?

* CLEVER...
* VERY CLEVER.
* OH YES.
* THERE YOU ARE, DARLING.
* IT'S TIME TO HAVE OUR
  LITTLE SHOWDOWN.
* IT'S TIME TO FINALLY STOP
  THE "MALFUNCTIONING" ROBOT.
* ... NOT!!!
* MALFUNCTION?
* REPROGRAMMING?
* PLEASE.
* THIS WAS ALL JUST A BIG
  SHOW.
* AN ACT.
* MY "MALFUNCTION" WAS ALL
  MADE UP BY DR. ALPHYS.
* AS SHE WATCHED YOU ON THE
  SCREEN, SHE GREW ATTACHED
  TO YOUR ADVENTURE.
* SHE DESPERATELY WANTED TO
  BE A PART OF IT.
* SO SHE DECIDED TO INSERT
  HERSELF INTO YOUR STORY.
* THIS SCENARIO, WHERE SHE
  "SAVES" YOU FROM ME, WAS
  HER CREATION.
* EVEN NOW, SHE IS WAITING
  OUTSIDE THIS ROOM.
* DURING OUR "BATTLE," SHE
  WILL INTERRUPT.
* THEN SHE WILL PRETEND TO
  "DEACTIVATE" ME, "SAVING" YOU
  ONE FINAL TIME.
* FINALLY.
* SHE'LL BE THE HEROINE OF
  YOUR ADVENTURE.
* FINALLY.
* SHE'LL BE SOMEONE SOMEBODY
  ACTUALLY LIKES.
* YOU'LL REGARD HER SO HIGHLY
  SHE'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO
  CONVINCE YOU NOT TO LEAVE.
* ... OR NOT.
* YOU SEE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
  THIS PREDICTABLE CHARADE.
* I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HARM
  HUMANS.
* FAR FROM IT, ACTUALLY.
* AS METTATON, MY ONLY DESIRE
  IS TO ENTERTAIN.
* AFTER ALL, THE AUDIENCE
  DESERVES A GOOD SHOW,
  DON'T THEY?
* AND WHAT'S A GOOD SHOW...
* WITHOUT A PLOT TWIST?
* MALFUNCTION?
* REPROGRAMMING?
* GET REAL.
* ALPHYS HAS BEEN PLAYING
  YOU FOR A FOOL THE
  WHOLE TIME.
* SHE REACTIVATED PUZZLES.
* SHE DISABLED ELEVATORS.
* SHE ENLISTED ME TO TORMENT YOU.
* ALL SO SHE COULD SAVE
  YOU FROM DANGERS THAT
  DIDN'T EXIST.
* ALL SO YOU WOULD THINK
  SHE'S THE GREAT PERSON...
* THAT SHE'S NOT.
* AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR
  HER FINEST HOUR.
* AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
  ALPHYS IS WAITING OUTSIDE
  THE ROOM.
* SHE WILL PRETEND TO
  "DEACTIVATE" ME, "SAVING" YOU
  ONE FINAL TIME.
* MY ONLY DESIRE IS TO
  ENTERTAIN.
* MY, MY.
* SO YOU'VE FINALLY ARRIVED.
* AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING, I
  REALIZED...
* SOMETHING GHASTLY.
* YOU'RE NOT JUST A THREAT
  TO MONSTERS...
* BUT HUMANITY, AS WELL.
* OH MY.
* THAT'S AN ISSUE.
* YOU SEE, I CAN'T BE A
  STAR WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE.
* AND BESIDES...
* THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE...
* I WANT TO PROTECT.
* SORRY, FOLKS!
* THE OLD PROGRAM'S BEEN
  CANCELLED!!!
* BUT WE'VE GOT A FINALE
  THAT WILL DRIVE YOU WILD!!
* REAL DRAMA!!
* REAL ACTION!!
* REAL BLOODSHED!!
* ON OUR NEW SHOW...
* "ATTACK OF THE KILLER
  ROBOT!"
* AH HA HA.
* EAGER, AS ALWAYS, EH?
* BUT DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL.
* THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
  HAVEN'T ACCOUNTED FOR.
* AS ANY TRUE FAN WOULD KNOW,
  I WAS FIRST CREATED AS
  A HUMAN ERADICATION ROBOT.
* IT WAS ONLY AFTER BECOMING A
  STAR THAT I WAS GIVEN A
  MORE... PHOTOGENIC BODY.
* HOWEVER.
* THOSE ORIGINAL FUNCTIONS
  HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY
  REMOVED...
* COME ANY CLOSER, AND
  I'LL BE FORCED TO SHOW
  YOU...

  ALPHYS.
* DON'T WORRY!
* I BUILT A STATUE
  OF HER, TOO.
* REALLY THOUGH.
* I REALIZED I WAS...
* NOT THE GREATEST
  TO HER.
* SO I WENT TO
  APOLOGIZE.
* AND, TO ASK HER
  TO HELP ME RULE.
* BUT I COULDN'T FIND
  HER.
* TRUST ME.
* I LOOKED.
* ANYWAY.
* I HOPE YOUR LIFE
  AFTER MEETING ME...

Mettaton Caller 1 (call)
Mettaton, your show
made us so happy!
Mettaton Caller 2 (call)
Mettaton, I don't
know what I'll
watch without you.
Mettaton Caller 3 (call)
Mettaton, there's
a Mettaton-shaped
hole in my Mettaton-
shaped heart.
Mettaton EX
Lights!
Camera!
Action!
Drama!
Romance!
Blood-
shed!
I'm the
idol
everyone
craves!
Smile
for the
camera!
Oooh, it's time
for a pop quiz!
I hope you brought
a keyboard...
This one's an
essay question!
Your essay really
showed everyone
your heart.
Why don't I show
you mine?
Ooooh,
I'm just
warming
up!
But how are you
on the dance floor!?
Can you
keep up
the
pace!?
Lights!
Camera
Bombs!
Things
are
blowing
up!
Time for our union-
regulated break!
We've grown so
distant, darling...
How about another
heart-to-heart?
A.. arms?
Wh... who needs arms
with legs like
these?
I'm still going
to win!
Come on
...!
The show
...
must go
on!
Dr...
Drama!
A...
Action!
L... lights...
C... camera...
Enough of this!
Do you really want
humanity to perish!?
... or do you just
believe in yourself
that much?
Haha, how inspiring!
Well, darling!
It's either me
or you!
But I think we both
already know who's
going to win.
Witness the true
power of humanity's
star!
... then...
Are YOU the star?
Can you really
protect humanity!?
H.. ha...
So I was wrong.
Darling...
You really are
strong enough to
get past ASGORE.
Well then...
It's time for
you to go.
Don't worry about
me.
I might seem like
I'm dying now,
but...
Dr. Alphys can
always repair me.
And... besides...
Even if I'm not
cut out to be
a star...
I still got to
perform for a
human, didn't I?
So, thank you,
darling...
You've been a
great audience!
OOH, LOOK AT
THESE RATINGS!!!
THIS IS THE MOST
VIEWERS I'VE EVER
HAD!!!
WE'VE REACHED THE
VIEWER CALL-IN
MILESTONE!
ONE LUCKY VIEWER
WILL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO TALK TO ME...
... BEFORE I LEAVE
THE UNDERGROUND
FOREVER!!
LET'S SEE WHO
CALLS IN FIRST!
HI, YOU'RE ON TV!
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY ON THIS,
OUR LAST SHOW???
NO, WAIT!
WAIT, BL...
H...
THEY ALREADY HUNG
UP.
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER
CALLER!!!
AH... I...
I SEE...
EVERYONE...
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DARLING.
PERHAPS... IT MIGHT BE
BETTER IF I STAY
HERE FOR A WHILE.
HUMANS ALREADY HAVE
STARS AND IDOLS,
BUT MONSTERS...
THEY ONLY HAVE ME.
IF I LEFT...
THE UNDERGROUND WOULD
LOSE ITS SPARK.
I'D LEAVE AN ACHING
VOID THAT CAN NEVER
BE FILLED.
SO... I THINK I'LL
HAVE TO DELAY MY
BIG DEBUT.
BESIDES.
YOU'VE PROVEN TO
BE VERY STRONG.
PERHAPS... EVEN STRONG
ENOUGH TO GET PAST
ASGORE.
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO PROTECT
HUMANITY.
HA, HA...
IT'S ALL FOR THE
BEST, ANYWAY.
THE TRUTH IS, THIS
FORM'S ENERGY
CONSUMPTION IS...
INEFFICIENT.
IN A FEW MOMENTS,
I'LL RUN OUT OF
BATTERY POWER, AND...
WELL.
I'LL BE ALRIGHT.
KNOCK 'EM DEAD,
DARLING.
AND EVERYONE...
THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN A
GREAT AUDIENCE!
Ohhhh my.
If you flipped my
switch, that can
only mean one
thing.
You're desperate
for the premiere
of my new body.
How rude...
Lucky for you,
I've been aching
to show this off
for a long time.
So... as thanks,
I'll give you a
handsome reward.
I'll make your
last living
moments...
ABSOLUTELY beautiful!
Speechless...?
Who can blame you?
Well... that's concise.
Beautiful. Sometimes
the fewest words
speak the loudest.
Nice. You get a
gold star.
Oh my... what a
great answer.
Oooooh, you said so
much about me...
I love how
passionate you are.
... even though I
don't understand
what you said...
Beautiful.
Why don't you
write a book?
Nice detail...
You're right, I do
look quite nice.
Wonderful! Amazing! A+...
I AM completely stunning.
Oh, I'm blushing...
You're completely right,
I am beautiful in
every way.
Oh my... I'm speechless...
You've completely
captured how
beautiful I am.
That's right.
Legs was the
correct answer!
How creative. Arms...
most people just
think about my legs.
My hair... yes,
I use metal hair
gel.
Yes, my personality
is quite charming,
isn't it?
They say I have
the voice of a
Siren...
... awooga!
Dancing...?
Thank you, I'm
self-taught.
Huh? This essay is
supposed to be about
me, not about you...
What a touching
confession! I'll add
it to the pile.
Toby? What the hell
is that?
Sounds... sexy.
Oh my! This is a family
friendly TV show.
Now stand still while
I murder you.
* There you are,
  Frisk-darling.
* Feast your eyes!
* Dr. Alphys completed
  my wonderful new body.
* Oooh!
* And did you hear?
* The barrier's OPEN!
* I can't wait to see
  the sun...
* ... the greatest
  spotlight of all!!
* Oh yes.
* I suppose I should thank
  you, too, darling.
* Before fighting you,
  I had...
* Forgotten how fun it
  was to perform with
  others.
* So I've been searching
  for HOT TALENTS to fill
  up my upcoming troupe.
* So far, Shyren's agreed
  to be my back-up singer.
* And Bl...
* Napstablook, here, will
  be my sound mixer!
* The three of us
  performing together...
* It really feels overdue,
  doesn't it?
* Frisk, darling.
* Can you help me with
  something?
* What kind of merchandise
  do you think humans
  would want to buy...?
* I've thought of a few
  ideas so far.
* Buttons (with my face)
* Stickers (with my face)
* CDs (with my face)
* Posters (with my face)
* T-shirts (with my face)
* Underwear (with my face)
* ... and plush dolls of
  TORIEL.
* But, you know.
* With my face instead
  of hers.
* So what do you think?
   
* Fabulous!
* I completely agree!
* Oh, Frisk.
* Why don't you go see
  how Alphys is doing?
* Since the flash of light
  she's been working hard
  to set everything right.
* Ha-Ha.
* About time, huh?
OH MY GOD!
WILL YOU TWO
JUST SMOOCH 
ALREADY!?
THE AUDIENCE IS
DYING FOR SOME
ROMANTIC ACTION!!!

YOU AREN'T
ABSOLUTELY EVIL.
IF YOU WERE

* Yo, I know I'm not supposed
  to be here, but...
* I wanna ask you something.
* Man, I've never had to ask
  anyone this before...
* Umm...
* Yo... You're human, right?
* Haha.
* Man! I knew it!
* ... well, I know it now,
  I mean...
* Undyne told me, um, "stay
  away from that human."
* So, like, ummm...
* I guess that makes us enemies
  or something.
* But I kinda stink at that,
  haha.
* Yo, say something mean so
  I can hate you?
* Huh...?
* Yo, that's your idea of
  something mean?
* My sister says that to me
  ALL THE TIME!
* Guess I have to do it, haha.
* Yo, I... I hate your guts.
* Man, I... I'm such a turd.
* I'm... I'm gonna go home
  now.
* Yo, what?
* So I have to do it?
* Here goes nothing...
Undyne...
You're...
You're hurt...
* Yo... did you see that!?
* Undyne just...
* ... TOUCHED ME!
* I'm never washing my face
  ever again...!
* Man, are you unlucky.
* If you were standing just
  a LITTLE bit to the left...!
* Yo, don't worry!
* I'm sure we'll see her
  again!
* ... yo, did you notice?
* She seemed really mad
  about something!
* She looked liked she was
  gonna blast me to pieces!
* But... sigh...
* Then she decided to put
  me down...
* Yo!
* There's always next time,
  right? Let's go!
* You aren't gonna tell my
  parents about this, are you?
* Undyne!!!
* I'll help you fight!!!
* YO!!!!
* You did it!!!
* Undyne is RIGHT in front
  of you!!!
* You've got front row seats
  to her fight!!!
* ... wait.
* Who's she fighting???
* H-hey!
* So, one time.
* We had a school project where
  we had to take care of
  a flower.
* The king - we had to call him
  "Mr. Dreemurr" - volunteered
  to donate his own flowers.
* He ended up coming to school
  and teaching the class about
  responsibility and stuff.
* That got me thinking...
* YO!
* How COOL would it be if
  UNDYNE came to school!?
* She could beat up ALL
  the teachers!!
* Yo...
* Yo...
* Where's the umbrella...?
* Ha... ha...
* Yo!
* Ready yet?
* Yo!
* You got us an umbrella?
* You're the best!
* Yo, you got an umbrella?
* Awesome!
* Yo! You can't hold an
  umbrella either?
* If you're walking anyway,
  I guess I'll go with you,
  haha...
* Let's go!
* Yo, I already looked,
  Undyne's not over here.
* So I guess I'll see
  ya later, haha.
* See ya later!
* Man, Undyne is sooooooo
  cool.
* She beats up bad guys and
  NEVER loses.
* If I was a human, I would
  wet the bed every night...
* ... knowing she was gonna
  beat me up!
* Ha ha.
* Ummm, maybe she wouldn't beat
  up the teachers...
* She's too cool to ever
  hurt an innocent person!
* Yo, you wanna see
  Undyne, right...?
* Climb on my shoulders.
* Put up your umbrella and
  climb on my shoulders.
* Yo, you go on ahead.
* Don't worry about me.
* I always find a way to
  get through!
* Owww...
* Yo, try being a little
  less rough, haha.
* Anyway, I'll look for
  another way through.
* Later!
* Yo!
* Yo.
* Undyne told me to stay
  away from you.
* She said you...
* You hurt a lot of people.
* But, yo, that's not true,
  right!?
* ... yo...
* Why won't you answer me?
* A... a... and what's with
  that weird expression...?
* Yo, dude...
* I... I heard some things,
  and...
* What?
* Look over here?
* What for  
* Yo, w-w-wait!
* Help!
* I tripped!
* Wh-what are you standing
  around for?
* Get over here, dude!
* I...
* I'm slipping!
* Undyne... you saved me...?
* Yo, I thought I was a
  goner, haha...
* ... wait, are you okay?
* It looks like you fell
  pretty hard...
* Th-this is my fault.
* I should have stayed away from
  them, like you said.
* They just stood there...
* Watching...
* Waiting for me to fall.
* They just went straight to
  fight you instead of
  helping me...
* I was so scared, and you...
* What?
* You're gonna go fight them
  now?
* But you look hurt...
* You should rest, haha...
* W-warriors don't rest, huh?
* Undyne... you're really cool.
* Y... y... yo... dude...
* If... If y-you wanna hurt
  my friend...
* You're gonna have to get
  through me, first.
* She's gone...
* Yo, you really saved my skin.
* Guess being enemies was just
  a nice thought, haha.
* We'll just have to be friends
  instead.
* ... man, I should REALLY go
  home...
* I bet my parents are worried
  sick about me!
* Later, dude!
* Oh...
* Oh man...
* (Man, my h-heart's pounding
  right out of my chest...)
* (... what would Undyne do?)
* Yo...
* Y-you'd b-better st-stop
  r-right where you are...
* Cause if you w-wanna hurt
  anyone else... you're...
* You're gonna have to get
  through me, first.
* A... and... and...
* S-see?
* I knew y-you weren't so
  bad!
* I've gotta go tell Undyne
  she was wrong about you!
* Undyne...
* You....
* You saved me!
* Huh?
* They ran away?
* Yo, you're wrong...
* They went to get help!
* They'll be back any second!!
* O-okay, I'll go home...
* Yo... did you see the
  way she was staring at
  you...?
* That...
* ... was AWESOME!
* I'm SOOOO jealous!
* What'd you do to get her
  attention...?
* Ha ha.
* C'mon!
* Let's go watch her beat
  up some bad guys!
* She was just standing there
  waiting FOREVER, and
  then you just...!!!
* Yo!
* You're a kid too, right?
* I can tell 'cause you're
  wearing a striped shirt.
* I wonder if that weird skeleton
  is an adult or a kid.
* Yo...
* There you are!
* I've been kinda worried
  about you since you
  ran away.
* ... but now I'm just kinda
  mad, ha ha.
* If Undyne hadn't saved me,
  that woulda been bad...
* Yo...
* Uh...
* Don't talk to me.
* Yo!!!
* What's up!?
* I've been kinda, doing
  some thinking...
* Maybe Undyne...
* Isn't actually as cool as
  we thought.
* She's just kinda... mean.
* But YO!!!
* I just found out about
  someone WAYYY cooler!!!
* Nyeh heh heh!!!
* Nyeh heh heh, dude.
* Yo, everyone ran away and
  hid somewhere.
* Man, adults can be so
  dumb sometimes, haha...
* Don't they know we've
  got Undyne to protect us!?
* Yo!
* Are you sneaking out to
  see her, too?
* Awesome...
* She's the coolest, right!?
* I wanna be just like her
  when I grow up...
* Hey, don't tell my parents
  I'm here.
* Ha ha.
* OK, I'm ready when you
  are.
* Yo!
* Where were you going...?
* My parents didn't tell you
  to come here, did they?
* You know where you're
  going, right...?
* I was just gonna follow
  you...
* Ha ha.
* Yo, this ledge is way
  too steep...
* Hmmm....
* Yo, you aren't going to
  be able to climb with
  an umbrella.
C'mon,
you got
this!
Monster Kid and Frisk
* Please? 
 
         Yes         No 
Muffet
What is it,
deary?
No, no, it's
time to go~
...
well... maybe
ONE little
nibble~~
Just kidding,
of course~
If you don't mind
being gobbled up~
Ahuhuhu~
Ahuhuhuhu~
Well, I don't
mind keeping
you here~
Feeling comfortable
trapped in that
web?
It's time to go~
Ahuhuhu~
What are you
doing~
Why so pale?
You should be proud~
Proud that you're
going to make a
delicious cake~
Ahuhuhu~
Let you go?
Don't be silly~
Your SOUL is going
to make every spider
very happy~~~
You're scaring off
all my customers!
Oh, how rude of me!
I almost forgot
to introduce you
to my pet~
It's breakfast time,
isn't it?
Have fun, you two~ 
The person who warned
us about you...
Offered us a LOT of
money for your SOUL.
Looked like a total
nerd.
They had such a sweet
smile~ and... ahuhu~
She was very
adamant I run away
with her~~~
Ahuhuhu~~~
It's strange, but
I swore I saw them
in the shadows...
Changing shape...?
She even left a
route for me to
escape from~
Oh, it's lunch time,
isn't it?
And I forgot to
feed my pet~
With that money,
the spider clans
can finally be
reunited~
She said she would
block off the rest
of Hotland after I
followed her~
You haven't heard?
Spiders have been
trapped in the RUINS
for generations!
Foolish nerd~
A spider NEVER leaves
her web~
(Except to sell
pastries~)
Even if they go
under the door,
Snowdin's fatal cold
is impassable alone.
Ah, but I do feel
a little regret
over it now...
But with the money
from your SOUL, we'll
be able to rent
them a heated limo~
Yes, I should have
wrapped her up when
I had the chance~
And with all of
the leftovers...?
We could have a
nice vacation~
Or even build a
spider baseball
field~
She looked like she
would have made a
juicy donut~~~
But enough of that...
It's time for
dinner, isn't it?
Ahuhuhu~
Don't look so
blue, my deary~
... I think purple is
a better look on
you! Ahuhuhu~
You're still alive?
Ahuhuhu~
Oh, my pet~
Looks like it's
time for dessert~
Huh?
Where did you get
that...?
Did you steal it?
Oh, my pet~
It's time to show
them what we do
with thieves~
Huh?
A telegram from
the spiders in
the RUINS?
What?
They're saying
that they saw
you, and...
... that this is
an error message!?
... even if you
are stingy, you
never hurt a
single spider!
... even if you
hurt others, you
never hurt a
single spider!
... you helped donate
to their cause!
... you were
really passionate
about spiders!
... you're a total
spider fanatic!
They say even if
you are a hyper-
violent murderer...
You never laid a
single finger on a
spider!
Oh my, this has
all been a big
misunderstanding~
I thought you
were someone that
hated spiders~
The person who
asked for that SOUL...
They must have
meant a DIFFERENT
human in a
striped shirt~
The person who
warned me about
you...
They really had
no idea what they
were talking about~
Sorry for all the
trouble~
Ahuhuhu~
I'll make it up
to you~
You can come back
here any time...
And, for no charge
at all...
I'll wrap you
up and let you
play with my pet
again!
Ahuhuhuhuhuhu~
Just kidding~
I'll SPARE you
now~
* Ahuhuhuhu...
* Did you hear what they
  just said?
* Did you hear what she
  said?
* They said a human wearing a
  striped shirt will come
  through.
* I heard that they hate
  spiders.
* I heard that they love to
  stomp on them.
* I heard that they hate
  everybody.
* I heard that they like to
  tear their legs off.
* I heard...
* However...
* And even if they gave us
  money, I heard...
* ... that they're awfully
  stingy with their money.
* ... a certain stingy human
  hates spiders.
* You think your taste
  is too refined for our
  pastries, don't you, deary?
* Ahuhuhu...
* I disagree with that
  notion.
* I think your taste...
* Is exactly what this
  next batch needs!
* ... that can't be true,
  can it?
* Ahuhuhu...
* You donated so much money
  to us.
* All the spiders want you
  to know how thankful
  they are!
* We're in your debt, dearie~
* ... that they have some awful
  taste.
* What a shame.
* A human comes through and they
  aren't even fit to be eaten~
* Oh well!
* Rotten ingredients can
  always be discarded~
* That was fun!
* See you again, dearie!
* Welcome to our parlor, dearie~
* Interested in some spider
  pastries?
* All proceeds go to real
  spiders~
* Check out the webs to
  make a purchase~
* There you are, dearie.
* You are always welcome in
  my parlor!
* Just stay on your best
  behavior~
* Ueee hee hee hee~
* Bonjour, dearie~
* I just finished tallying up
  all of our donations!
* We've finally raised enough
  to rescue all the spiders
  inside of the RUINS.
* And we'll also be able to
  afford...!
* ... nothing, because we
  only sold one donut.
* What's wrong with everyone?
* Don't they like spiders~
* 4 pairs of stylish sunglasses
  for every spider!
* 4 pairs of waterproof booties
  for every spider!
* 4 pairs of stylish heels for
  every spider!
* A spider baseball field!
* We've already got the baseball
  donuts ready~
* A spider football stadium!
* We'll play with 4 balls on the
  field at once!
* A brand new bakery!
* Thank you so much, dearie!
* It's all because of you 
* (r money).
* A vacation anywhere in the
  entire world!
* Should we go to the tropics?
* Or a creepy abandoned house?
* We can't decide~
You've
GOT to
win!
Nacarat Jester
* Hey, I haven't seen you
  around before.
* It's nice to meet new
  people, isn't it?
* I...
* I don't know you.
* We all know the underground
  has problems, but we
  smile anyway.
* Why?
* We can't do anything, so
  why be morose about it?
* Smile smile.
* Maybe I'll try frowning
  for once.
* ... no.
* I just can't do it.
* Oh?
* We're free?
* Finally...
* I'll be able to stop
  smiling.
* Just now, I felt my smile
  falter for a moment.
* What's wrong?

Napstablook's Cousin (diary)
* Dear Diary:
* Shyren's sister "fell down"
  recently.
* It's sad.
* Without her sister to
  speak for her...
* She's become more
  reclusive than ever.
* So I reached out to her,
  and told her...
* That she, Blooky, and I
  should all perform together
  sometime.
* She seemed to like
  that idea.
* Dearer Diary:
* I like to buy a new diary
  for every entry I make.
* I love to collect diaries.
* Dearest Diary:
* Our cousin left the farm
  to become a training dummy.
* That leaves just Blooky
  and I.
* Blooky asked me if I was
  going to try to become
  corporeal, too.
* They sounded so...
* Resigned...
* Come on, Blooky.
* You know I'd never leave
  you behind.
* And besides...
* I'd never find the kind
  of body I'm looking for,
  anyway.
* My Darling Diary:
* I met someone...
* Interesting today.
* Last week I posted that
  advertisement for my
  Human Fanclub.
* Today was our first meeting.
* Only one other person came.
* Honestly, she's a dork.
* And she's obsessed with
  these awful cartoons.
* But she's kind of funny,
  too....
* I want to see her again.
* Diary... My dear:
* My diary collection is
  going fabulously.
* I have like five now.
* Dear Diary:
* She surpised me with
  something today.
* Sketches of a body that
  she wants to create for
  me...
* A form beyond my wildest
  fantasies.
* In a form like that, I
  could finally feel
  like... "myself."
* After all, there's no
  way I can be a star
  the way I am now.
* Sorry, Blooky.
* My dreams can't wait
  for anyone...

Nice Cream Guy
* Hello!
* Would you like some
  Nice Cream?
* It's the frozen treat
  that warms your heart!
 
* Nice Cream!
* It's the frozen treat
  that warms your heart!
* Here you go!
* Have a super-duper day!
* (You got the Nice Cream.)
* Huh?
* You don't have enough
  money...
* I wish I could make
  Nice Cream for free...
* It looks like you're
  holding too much stuff!
* Oh well!
* Well then...
* Tell your friends...
* There's ice cream...
* Out in the middle of
  the woods...
* Hey, you have an umbrella,
  just like my cart...
* Such solidarity!
* I have no choice but to
  give you a deal!
* Umbrella solidarity!?
* I guess I have to give
  you a deal...
* Hey!
* You have 3 Punch Cards!
* How about redeeming them
  for some Nice Cream!?
* Huh? No money?
* Sorry, I can't give it to
  you for free.
* Huh? You can't afford it
  even with the discount?
* I...
* There's ice cream...
* Hidden in the depths of a
  watery cavern...
* Hello...
* Would you like some
  Nice Cream...?
* It's the frozen treat...
* That warms your heart.
* Nice Cream.
* It's the frozen treat.
* That warms your heart.
* Here.
* (You got the Nice Cream.)
* You don't have enough
  money...
* Drop something.
* Life... is suffering.
* I don't understand why
  these aren't selling...
* It's the perfect weather
  for something cold...
* I relocated my store, but
  there are still no
  customers...
* I thought for sure if I
  went to Hotland, I'd sell
  some Nice Creams.
* But nobody wants them.
* Everyone's just eating
  Starfaits and Glamburgers.
* So!!!
* I'm so happy!!
* Nice Cream is really
  changing the world!!
* Hey!
* It's you again!
* Business is excellent here!
* These two fellas bought
  ALL my ice cream!
* I've actually sold out of
  everything!!!
* ... sorry.
* Wait!
* I've still got something
  for you!
* ... a big smile!
* How about that!
* I'm so excited to sell
  Nice Cream on the surface!
* If all humans are like you,
  then...!
* ... then I'll still be
  able to sell to monsters,
  I hope.
* If all humans are like you,
  I think it'll be a modest
  success!
* If all humans are like you,
  I think it'll be really
  popular!
* OH!!!!
* A CUSTOMER!!!
* Fortunately, I've thought
  of a solution!!
* Punch cards!!
* Every time you buy a
  Nice Cream, you can take a
  punch card from the box.
* If you have 3 cards, you
  can trade them for a
  free Nice Cream!
* They're sure to get the
  customers to come back!
* Anyway...
* I'm having a going out of
  business sale.
Nice Cream Guy (Nice Cream wrapper)

Omega Flowey
* Hee hee hee.
* Did you really think
  you could run away?
* Did you really think
  I was gonna be
  satisfied...
* ... killing you only
  ONE time?
* Pathetic...
* Now you're REALLY
  gonna die!
* Do you even realize
  what will happen if
  you defeat me...?
* Don't you get it?
* There's no such thing
  as happy endings.
* This is all that's
  left...!
* Are you REALLY that
  desperate...?
* Hee hee hee...
* Are you letting me
  kill you...
* ... on PURPOSE?
* SICKO. Ha ha ha.
* Honestly, fighting
  you IS pretty fun...
* ... So even if you
  ARE a sicko, I'll
  take it!
* Maybe you're wondering
  if I ever get tired
  of winning...
* Wanna see my answer?
Howdy!
It's me, FLOWEY.
FLOWEY the FLOWER!
I owe you a HUGE thanks.
You really did a number
on that old fool.
Without you, I NEVER could
have gotten past him.
But now, with YOUR help...
 
He's DEAD.
And I'VE got the human
SOULS!
Boy!
I've been empty for so
long...
It feels great to have a
SOUL inside me again.
Mmmm, I can feel them
wriggling...
Awww, you're feeling
left out, aren't you?
Well, that's just perfect.
After all, I only have
six souls.
I still need one more...
Before I become GOD.
And then, with my
newfound powers...
Monsters.
Humans.
Everyone.
I'll show them all the REAL
meaning of this world.
Oh, and forget about escaping
to your old SAVE FILE.
It's gone FOREVER.
Golly, if only you
had a SAVE FILE you
could run away to...
But you were just
too STUPID to make one!
But don't worry.
Your old friend FLOWEY...
Has worked out a replacement
for you!
I'll SAVE over your own
death.
So you can watch me tear
you to bloody pieces...
Over, and over, and over...
... what?
Do you really think
you can stop ME?
Hee hee hee...
You really ARE an idiot.
Long ago, two races
ruled over Earth:
HUMANS and MONSTERS.   
One day, they all
disappeared without
a trace.
* No... NO!!!
* This CAN'T be
  happening!!!
* You... YOU...
* You IDIOT. 
* Did you REALLY
  think...
* You could
  defeat ME!?
* I am the GOD of
  this world.
* And YOU?
* You're HOPELESS.
* Hopeless and
  alone...
* Golly, that's
  right!
* Your WORTHLESS
  friends...
* ... can't save
  you now.
* Call for help.
* I dare you.
* Cry into the
  darkness!
"Mommy! Daddy!"
"Somebody help!"
* See what good
  it does you!
* You... uh...
* Would you STOP that?
* Anyway, YOU!
* But nobody came.
* Boy!
* What a shame!
* Nobody else...
* Is gonna get to
  see you DIE!!!
* What? 
* How'd you...? 
* Well, I'll just
* Wh... 
* Where are my
  powers!? 
* The souls...? 
* What are they
  doing? 
* NO!! NO!!!!! 
* YOU CAN'T DO
  THAT!!! 
* YOU'RE SUPPOSED
  TO OBEY ME!! 
* STOP!!!
  STOP IT!!!!! 
* STOOOOPPPP!!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
  And you're NEVER
  waking up! 
  This is all just
  a bad dream...

* Originally, we dug mazes
  with puzzles in order to
  foil human attacks.
* But now, building things
  winding and confusing....
* It's some awful tradition.
* You can't go (ugh) two feet
  without being up to your
  armpits in puzzles.
* The surface world...
* Really!
* Maybe I'll be able to
  go two feet without running
  into a puzzle.
* One thing I can say...
* I respect Mettaton for not
  putting any puzzles here.
* At another hotel, I had
  to find 12 magic keys just to
  unlock the shower.

* Did y'hear!?
* You're back!
* I'll tell you a big secret.
* I'm starting a band, y'hear?
* It's called the Red Hot
  Chibi Peppers.
* All I've thought of is
  the name.
* And I don't, play...
* Instruments, or sing.
* Well!
* Do you think we'll be
  popular!!!
* Yeah, me too...
* Hey... there...

* Onionsan, y'hear!
* You're visiting Waterfall, huh!* It's great here, huh!
* You love it, huh!
* Yeah!
* Me too!
* It's my Big Favorite.
* Even though, the water's
  getting so shallow here...
* I, have to sit down all
  the time, but...
* He-hey! That's OK!
* It beats moving to the city!
* And living in a crowded
  aquarium!
* Like all my friends did!
* And the aquarium's full,
  a-anyway, so, even if I
  wanted to, I...
* That's okay though, y'hear!
* Undyne's gonna fix
  everything, y'hear!
* I'm gonna get out of here
  and live in the ocean!
* Y'hear!
* Hey... there...
* That's the end of this room.
* I'll see you around!
* Have a good time!
* In Waterfalllllllllllllllll
  lllllllllllll
* Oh!
* Did y'hear!!!
* ...
* I got nothing else...
* To talk about...
* I've been wondering when
  we're all gonna go free.
* S-since... if we did...
* How would I ever know?
* Well, I'll keep my
  tentacles out for you!
* Y'hear!
* As soon as I know I'll be
  the first to tell you!
* Y'hear!!
* It's gotta be any day now!
Papyrus
SANS!!!
THAT DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING!
SANS!!!
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT IT!
WHAT!?
CROSSWORD!?
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SAID THAT!!
IN MY OPINION...
JUNIOR JUMBLE
IS EASILY THE
HARDEST.
UN. BELIEVABLE.
HUMAN!!!
SOLVE THIS DISPUTE!
    
HA! HA! YES!
HUMANS MUST BE
VERY INTELLIGENT!
IF THEY ALSO FIND
JUNIOR JUMBLE
SO DIFFICULT!
NYEH! HEH! HEH HEH!
YOU TWO ARE WEIRD!
CROSSWORDS ARE SO
EASY.
IT'S THE SAME
SOLUTION EVERY
TIME.
I JUST FILL ALL
THE BOXES IN WITH
THE LETTER "Z"...
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT A
CROSSWORD...
ALL I CAN DO IS
SNORE!!!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
WHAT!?
HOW DID YOU
AVOID MY TRAP?
AND, MORE
IMPORTANTLY...
IS THERE ANY
LEFT FOR ME???
REALLY!?
WOWIE...
NO ONE'S EVER
ENJOYED MY
COOKING BEFORE...
WELL THEN!!
YOU RESISTED THE
FLAVOR OF MY
HOMECOOKED PASTA...
JUST SO YOU
COULD SHARE
IT WITH ME???
FRET NOT HUMAN!
I, MASTER CHEF
PAPYRUS...
WILL MAKE YOU ALL
THE PASTA YOU
COULD EVER WANT!
HEH HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH NYEH!
HEY!
IT'S THE HUMAN!
YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE THIS
PUZZLE!
IT WAS MADE
BY THE GREAT
DR. ALPHYS!
YOU SEE
THESE TILES
!?
ONCE I THROW
THIS SWITCH...
THEY WILL
BEGIN TO
CHANGE COLOR!
EACH COLOR HAS
A DIFFERENT
FUNCTION!
RED TILES ARE
IMPASSABLE!
YOU CANNOT
WALK ON THEM!
YELLOW TILES
ARE ELECTRIC!
THEY WILL
ELECTROCUTE
YOU!
GREEN TILES
ARE ALARM
TILES!
IF YOU STEP
ON THEM...
YOU WILL HAVE
TO FIGHT A
MONSTER!!
ORANGE TILES
ARE ORANGE-
SCENTED.
THEY WILL MAKE
YOU SMELL
DELICIOUS!
BLUE TILES ARE
WATER TILES.
SWIM THROUGH
IF YOU LIKE,
BUT...
IF YOU SMELL
LIKE ORANGES!
THE PIRANHAS
WILL BITE
YOU.
ALSO, IF A
BLUE TILE IS
NEXT TO A,
YELLOW TILE,
THE WATER WILL
ALSO ZAP YOU!
PURPLE TILES
ARE SLIPPERY!
YOU WILL SLIDE
TO THE NEXT
TILE!
HOWEVER, THE
SLIPPERY
SOAP...
SMELLS LIKE
LEMONS!!
WHICH PIRANHAS
DO NOT LIKE!
PURPLE AND
BLUE ARE OK!
FINALLY,
PINK TILES.
THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING.
STEP ON THEM
ALL YOU LIKE.
HOW WAS THAT!?
UNDERSTAND???
GREAT!!
THEN THERE'S ONE
LAST THING...
THIS PUZZLE...
IS ENTIRELY RANDOM
!!!!!!
WHEN I PULL THIS
SWITCH, IT WILL
MAKE A PUZZLE...
THAT HAS NEVER
BEEN SEEN BEFORE!
NOT EVEN I WILL
KNOW THE SOLUTION!
NYEH HEH HEH!
GET READY...!
OKAY...
I GUESS I'LL
REPEAT MYSELF...
RED TILES ARE
IMPASSABLE.
YELLOW TILES ARE
ELECTRIC AND
DANGEROUS.
BLUE TILES MAKE
YOU FIGHT A
MONSTER.
GREEN TILES ARE
WATER TILES.
ORANGE TILES ARE
ORANGE SCENTED.
IF YOU STEP ON
ORANGE, DON'T STEP
ON GREEN.
BROWN TILES ARE...
WAIT!!!
THERE ARE NO
BROWN TILES...
PURPLE TILES
SMELL LIKE
LEMONS...
WHY DON'T THE
YELLOW ONES
SMELL LEMONY?
UMM...
WAIT!!
DID I MIX UP
GREEN AND BLUE!?
THE BLUE ONES
ARE WATER ONES!
PINK TILES...
I DON'T...
REMEMBER???
WAIT!!!
THOSE ONES DON'T
DO ANYTHING.
OKAY!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
BETTER NOW!?
..........
OK, YOU KNOW
WHAT???
HOW ABOUT...
YOU JUST...
DO THIS PUZZLE...
ON YOUR OWN...
I'LL LEAVE THE
INSTRUCTIONS...
JUST READ THEM.
THEN WHEN YOU
UNDERSTAND IT...
YOU CAN THROW
THE SWITCH.
AND DO IT AT
YOUR OWN PACE.
GOOD LUCK.
NYEH...
HEH...
HEH!
NYOO HOO HOO...
I CAN'T EVEN
STOP SOMEONE AS
WEAK AS YOU...
UNDYNE'S GOING TO
BE DISAPPOINTED
IN ME.
I'LL NEVER JOIN THE
ROYAL GUARD...
AND...
MY FRIEND QUANTITY
WILL REMAIN
STAGNANT!
WOWIE!!
YOU DID IT!!!
YOU DIDN'T DO A
VIOLENCE!!!
TO BE HONEST,
I WAS A LITTLE
AFRAID...
BUT YOU'RE ALREADY
BECOMING A GREAT
PERSON!
I'M SO PROUD I
COULD CRY!!!
... WAIT, WASN'T I
SUPPOSED TO
CAPTURE YOU...?
WELL, FORGET IT!
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE THE BEST
PERSON YOU CAN BE.
SO LET'S LET
BYBONES BE
BYBONES.
I'LL EVEN TELL YOU
HOW TO LEAVE THE
UNDERGROUND!
JUST KEEP GOING
EAST!
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL
REACH THE KING'S
CASTLE.
THEN YOU CAN
LEAVE!
REALLY!?
YOU WANT TO BE
FRIENDS, WITH ME???
WELL THEN...
I GUESS...
I GUESS
I CAN MAKE AN
ALLOWANCE FOR YOU!
HUH?
WHY WOULD YOU...
BERATE YOURSELF
SO LOUDLY???
IS IT BECAUSE...
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE MY FRIEND?
NO!!!
YOU'RE GREAT!!!
I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND!
WOWIE!!
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
OUR FIRST DATE...
AND I'VE ALREADY
MANAGED TO HIT
THE FRIEND ZONE!!!
WHO KNEW THAT
ALL I NEEDED TO
MAKE PALS...
WOW!!!
I HAVE FRIENDS!!!
AND WHO KNEW THAT
ALL I NEEDED TO
MAKE THEM...
WAS TO GIVE PEOPLE
AWFUL PUZZLES AND
THEN FIGHT THEM??
YOU TAUGHT ME A
LOT, HUMAN.
I HEREBY GRANT
YOU PERMISSION
TO PASS THROUGH!
AND I'LL GIVE
YOU DIRECTIONS
TO THE SURFACE.
CONTINUE FORWARD
UNTIL YOU REACH THE
END OF THE CAVERN.
THEN... WHEN YOU
REACH THE CAPITAL,
CROSS THE BARRIER.
THAT'S THE MAGICAL
SEAL TRAPPING US
ALL UNDERGROUND.
ANYTHING CAN ENTER
THROUGH IT, BUT
NOTHING CAN EXIT...
... EXCEPT SOMEONE
WITH A POWERFUL
SOUL.
... LIKE YOU!!!
THAT'S WHY THE
KING WANTS TO
ACQUIRE A HUMAN.
HE WANTS TO OPEN
THE BARRIER WITH
SOUL POWER.
THEN US MONSTERS
CAN RETURN TO
THE SURFACE!
YOU'RE BACK AGAIN?!?!
I FINALLY REALIZE
THE TRUE REASON WHY.
YOU...
JUST MISS SEEING MY
FACE SO MUCH...
I'M NOT SURE I
CAN FIGHT SOMEONE
WHO FEELS THIS WAY.
BUT MOSTLY... I'M GETTING
REALLY TIRED OF
CAPTURING YOU!
SO...
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
 
OKAY...
I GUESS.
IF YOU WANT ME TO
CAPTURE YOU.
I'LL TRY AGAIN!!!
... OKAY...
I GUESS I'LL ACCEPT
MY FAILURE...
BEPIS.

WITH YOU!!!
R-REALLY???
WOWIE!!!
FORTUNATELY, IT
ONLY SAYS TO
ASK!!!
I GUESS THAT
MEANS IT'S
TIME FOR PART
THREE!!!
STEP THREE...
PUT ON NICE
CLOTHES TO
SHOW YOU CARE!
...
WAIT A SECOND.
WEAR CLOTHING...
THAT THING ON
YOUR BODY...
THAT BANDAGE
HANGING OFF
OF YOU...
THAT RIBBON IN
YOUR HAIR...
THAT BANDANNA
AROUND YOUR
HEAD...
THAT TUTU AROUND
YOUR WAIST...
THOSE GLASSES ON
YOUR FACE...
THAT APRON YOU
PUT ON...
THAT COWBOY HAT
ON YOUR HEAD...
THAT LOCKET
AROUND YOUR NECK.
YOU'RE WEARING
CLOTHING RIGHT
NOW!!!
NOT ONLY THAT...
EARLIER TODAY,
YOU WERE ALSO
WEARING CLOTHING!
  
NO...
COULD IT BE???
  
YOU'VE WANTED TO
DATE ME FROM
THE VERY
BEGINNING!??
YOU'VE WANTED TO
HANG OUT WITH
ME FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING!??
NO!!
YOU PLANNED IT
ALL!!!
YOU'RE WAY BETTER
AT DATING THAN
I AM!!!
N-NOOOO!!!
YOUR DATING POWER 
...!!!
YOU'RE WAY BETTER
AT HANGING OUT
THAN I AM!!!
N-NOOOO!!!
YOUR FRIENDSHIP
POWER!!!
DESPITE THAT, YOU
CHOSE TO WEAR
CLOTHING TODAY, OF
ALL DAYS...?
WAS YOUR INTEREST
IN ME...
WAS YOUR
FRIENDSHIP...
PREDESTINED!?!?
NYEH!
DON'T THINK YOU'VE
BESTED ME YET!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS...
HAVE NEVER BEEN
BEATEN AT DATING,
AND I NEVER WILL!
JUST IN CASE
SOMEBODY HAPPENS
TO ASK ME ON
A DATE!!!
HAVE NEVER BEEN
BEATEN AT HANGING
OUT, AND I NEVER
WILL!
JUST IN CASE
SOMEONE WANTS
TO HANG OUT!
I CAN EASILY
KEEP UP WITH
YOU!!!
YOU SEE,
I, TOO, CAN WEAR
CLOTHING!!!
IN FACT...
I ALWAYS WEAR MY
"SPECIAL" CLOTHES
UNDERNEATH MY
REGULAR CLOTHES!!
BEHOLD!!!
NYEH!
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF MY
SECRET STYLE!?!
NO!!!
A GENUINE
COMPLIMENT...!!!
YOUR HONESTY...!
IT SHOWS HOW
MUCH YOU REALLY
CARE!!!
HOWEVER...
YOU DON'T TRULY
UNDERSTAND THE 
HIDDEN POWER OF
THIS OUTFIT!!!
THEREFORE...
WHAT YOU JUST
SAID IS INVALID!!!
THIS DATE WON'T
ESCALATE ANY
FURTHER!!!
THIS HANG-OUT
WON'T ESCALATE
ANY FURTHER!
... UNLESS
YOU FIND MY
SECRET!!
BUT THAT WON'T
HAPPEN!!
MY HAT...?
MY HAT.
MY HAT!
W-WELL THEN...
YOU FOUND MY
SECRET!
I SUPPOSE I HAVE
NO CHOICE!
IT'S A PRESENT...
A PRESENT J-JUST
FOR YOU!!!
GO AHEAD!
OPEN IT!
YOU CAN'T EVEN
BRING YOURSELF TO
HARM MY DELICATE
WRAPPING??
N-NO...
THAT TECHNIQUE!
IT'S TOO STRONG!
COUNTERATTACK!
I'LL OPEN THE
PRESENT MYSELF!!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS?
"SPAGHETTI."
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,
ISN'T IT?
RIGHT!
BUT OH-SO WRONG!
NYEH HEH HEH!
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA!
THOUGH THIS
APPEARS TO BE
SPAGHETTI...
THIS AIN'T ANY
PLAIN OL' PASTA!
THIS IS AN
ARTISAN'S WORK!
SILKEN SPAGHETTI,
FINELY AGED IN
AN OAKEN CASK...
THEN COOKED BY
ME, MASTER CHEF
PAPYRUS!
HUMAN!!!
IT'S TIME TO
END THIS!!
THERE'S NO WAY
THIS CAN GO
ANY FURTHER!
EAT THIS!
MY ULTIMATE
TECHNIQUE!!!
WHAT A PASSIONATE
EXPRESSION!!!
YOU MUST REALLY
LOVE MY COOKING!
AND BY EXTENSION,
ME!!!
MAYBE EVEN MORE
THAN I DO!!!
YOU MEAN...
YOU'RE LETTING ME
HAVE IT INSTEAD?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE
PASTA...
IMPOSSIBLE!!
TAKING MY PRESENT
AND TURNING IT
AROUND ON ME!
AUGH!!!
URRRGH!!!
NOOOOOOOO!!!
HUMAN.
IT'S CLEAR NOW.
YOU'RE MADLY IN
LOVE WITH ME.
EVERYTHING YOU DO.
EVERYTHING
YOU SAY.
IT'S ALL BEEN
FOR MY SAKE.
HUMAN. I WANT
YOU TO BE
HAPPY, TOO.
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO EXPRESS MY
FEELINGS.
IT'S TIME THAT
I TOLD YOU.
I, PAPYRUS...
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
OBSESSED WITH ME.
HUMAN. I WANT
YOU TO BE
HAPPY,TOO.
I, PAPYRUS...
I...
UM...
BOY, IS IT HOT
IN HERE, OR IS
IT JUST ME??
...
OH, SHOOT.
HUMAN, I...
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T LIKE YOU
THE WAY YOU
LIKE ME.
ROMANTICALLY,
I MEAN.
I MEAN, I TRIED
VERY HARD TO!
I THOUGHT THAT
BECAUSE YOU
FLIRTED WITH ME...
THAT I WAS
SUPPOSED
TO GO ON A
DATE WITH YOU.
THEN, ON THE DATE,
FEELINGS WOULD
BLOSSOM FORTH!!!
I WOULD BE ABLE
TO MATCH YOUR
PASSION FOR ME!
BUT ALAS...
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS...
HAVE FAILED.
I FEEL JUST THE
SAME AS BEFORE.
AND INSTEAD, BY
DATING YOU...
I HAVE ONLY DRAWN
YOU DEEPER...
INTO YOUR INTENSE
LOVE FOR ME!
A DARK PRISON OF
PASSION, WITH NO
ESCAPE.
HOW COULD I HAVE
DONE THIS TO MY
DEAR FRIEND...?
NO! WAIT!
THAT'S WRONG!
I CAN'T FAIL AT
ANYTHING!!!
HUMAN!!!
I'LL HELP YOU
THROUGH THESE
TRYING TIMES!!!
I'LL KEEP BEING
YOUR COOL
FRIEND...
AND ACT LIKE THIS
ALL NEVER
HAPPENED.
AFTER ALL, YOU
ARE VERY GREAT.
IT WOULD BE
TRAGIC TO LOSE
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.
SO PLEASE....
DON'T CRY BECAUSE
I WON'T KISS YOU.
BECAUSE, I DON'T
EVEN HAVE LIPS.
AND HEY, SOMEDAY,
YOU'LL FIND
SOMEONE AS
GREAT AS ME.
WELL, NO.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
BUT I'LL HELP YOU
SETTLE FOR
SECOND BEST!!!
NYEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH!!!
HMM...
WELL, I'M FLATTERED
YOU CARE SO MUCH.
BUT MAYBE COOL
IT A LITTLE BIT...?
YOU ARE A VERY
NICE PERSON.
I'M GLAD WE'RE
FRIENDS.
BUT, I THINK YOU
CAN REACH YOUR
MAX POTENTIAL,,,
IF YOU LIVE MORE
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
RATHER THAN JUST
FOR MINE.
HMMM...
HEY, I KNOW THE
SOLUTION!!!
YOU SHOULD HANG
OUT WITH MY BOSS,
UNDYNE!!!
I THINK IF YOU
SPREAD YOUR FRIEND-
ENERGY OUT MORE...
YOU'LL HAVE A MORE
HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
YEAH!!!
LET'S BE FRIENDS
WITH UNDYNE!!!
OH, AND IF YOU
EVER NEED TO
REACH ME...
HERE'S MY PHONE
NUMBER.
YOU CAN CALL
ME ANY TIME!
PLATONICALLY.
WELL, GOTTA GO!

SHAKIN'!!!
IT'S TIME TO JOG
100 LAPS, HOOTING
ABOUT HOW GREAT
WE ARE!!!
 ALAS, POOR
 PAPYRUS!
 W-WELL, THAT'S
 NOT WHAT I
 EXPECTED...
 WELL, AT LEAST I
 STILL HAVE MY
 HEAD!
 BUT...
 ST... STILL!
 I BELIEVE IN
 YOU!
 YOU CAN DO A
 LITTLE BETTER!
 EVEN IF YOU
 DON'T THINK SO!
 I...
 I PROMISE...
 WELL...! *HUFF*
 IT'S CLEAR...
 YOU CAN'T! *HUFF*
 DEFEAT ME!!!
 YEAH!!!
 I CAN SEE YOU
 SHAKING IN YOUR
 BOOTS!!!
 THEREFORE I, THE
 GREAT PAPYRUS,
 ELECT TO GRANT

 I WILL SPARE YOU,
 HUMAN!!!
 NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 TO ACCEPT MY
 MERCY.
 WHAT THE HECK!
 THAT'S MY
 SPECIAL ATTACK!
 HEY!

 DO YOU HEAR
 ME!?
 STOP MUNCHING ON
 THAT BONE!!!
 HEY!!!
 WHAT ARE YOU
 DOING!!!
 COME BACK HERE
 WITH MY SPECIAL
 ATTACK!!!
 ...
 OH WELL.
 OH WELL.
 I'LL JUST USE
 A REALLY COOL
 REGULAR ATTACK.
  ...
 OH, I SHOULD
 HAVE BROUGHT ONE
  OF THOSE.
 SO YOU'RE
 SERIOUS...
 SO YOU WON'T
 FIGHT...
 THEN, LET'S SEE
 IF YOU CAN HANDLE
 MY FABLED
 'BLUE ATTACK!'
 BEHOLD!
 HMMM... I WONDER
 WHAT I SHOULD
 WEAR...
 HOW HIGH CAN YOU
 JUMP?
 WHAT!? I'M NOT
 THINKING ABOUT
 THAT DATE THING!!
 TRY HOLDING THE
 'UP' BUTTON TO
 JUMP!!!
 YEAH!
 DON'T MAKE ME
 USE MY SPECIAL
 ATTACK!
 HOLD 'UP' LONGER
 TO JUMP HIGHER!
 JEEZ!!!
 I CAN ALMOST
 TASTE MY FUTURE
 POPULARITY!!!
 PAPYRUS:
 HEAD OF THE
 ROYAL GUARD!
 PAPYRUS:
 UNPARALLELED
 SPAGHETTORE!
 UNDYNE WILL BE
 REALLY PROUD
 OF ME!!
 THE KING WILL
 TRIM A HEDGE
 IN THE SHAPE
 OF MY SMILE!!!
 MY BROTHER WILL
 ... WELL, HE
 WON'T CHANGE
 VERY MUCH.
 I'LL HAVE LOTS
 OF ADMIRERS!!
 BUT...
 HOW WILL I
 KNOW IF PEOPLE
 SINCERELY LIKE
 ME???
 WILL ANYONE LIKE
 ME AS SINCERELY
 AS YOU?
 SOMEONE LIKE
 YOU IS REALLY
 RARE...
 I DON'T THINK
 THEY'LL LET YOU
 GO...
 AND DATING MIGHT
 BE KIND OF
 HARD...
 AFTER YOU'RE
 CAPTURED AND
 SENT AWAY.
 URGH...
 WHO CARES!
 GIVE UP!!
 GIVE UP OR
 FACE MY...
 SPECIAL ATTACK!!!
 YEAH!!!
 VERY SOON I WILL
 USE MY
 SPECIAL ATTACK! 
 NOT TOO LONG
 AND I WILL
 USE THAT
 SPECIAL ATTACK!!!
 THIS IS YOUR
 LAST CHANCE...
 BEFORE MY
 SPECIAL ATTACK!!
 BEHOLD...!
 MY SPECIAL
 ATTACK!
 *SIGH* HERE'S AN
 ABSOLUTELY
 NORMAL ATTACK.
 NYEH HEH HEH!
 I DON'T DESERVE
 SUCH HOSPITALITY
 FROM YOU ...
 YOUR BARBS HIDE A
 HIDDEN AFFECTION!
 YOU EMOTIONAL
 CACTUS!
 DON'T WASTE YOUR
 WORDS ON ME!
 LET'S DATE
 L-LATER!!
 AFTER I CAPTURE
 YOU!
 HOW SELFLESS...
 YOU WANT ME TO
 FEEL BETTER
 ABOUT FIGHTING
 YOU...
 THERE'S NO NEED
 TO LIE TO
 YOURSELF!!!
 DON'T...!
 WHAT!?
 FL-FLIRTING!?
 SO YOU FINALLY
 REVEAL YOUR 
 ULTIMATE FEELINGS!
 W-WELL!
 I'M A SKELETON
 WITH VERY HIGH
 STANDARDS!!!
 OH NO!!!
 OH NO!!! YOU'RE
 MEETING ALL MY
 STANDARDS!!!
 I GUESS THIS MEANS
 I HAVE TO GO ON A
 DATE WITH YOU...?
 OH NO!!!
 THAT HUMILITY...
 IT REMINDS ME OF,
 MYSELF!!!
 YOU'RE MEETING ALL
  MY STANDARDS!!!
I MUST
CAPTURE
A
HUMAN!
THEN
EVERY
ONE
WILL,
 NO! WAIT!!
 YOU'RE MY FRIEND!
 I COULD NEVER
  CAPTURE YOU!!
 THIS IS AN ERROR
 MESSAGE.
 REALLY!!!
 YOU'RE TOO WEAK!!
 I WAS EASILY ABLE
 TO CAPTURE YOU!!!
 I WILL NOW SEND
 YOU TO THE
 CAPTURE ZONE!!
 OR, AS SANS
 CALLS IT...
 OUR GARAGE???
 YOU'RE IN THE
 DOGHOUSE NOW!
 NYEH HEH HEH HEH
 HEH HEH HEH!!!
 WELL!!! YOU MAY
 HAVE CLEVERLY
 ESCAPED FROM
 JAIL BEFORE...
 BUT THIS TIME,
 I'VE UPGRADED
 THE FACILITIES.
 NOT ONLY WILL
 YOU BE
 TRAPPED...
 BUT YOU WON'T
 EVEN WANT
 TO LEAVE!!!
 YOU ARE...
 PERSISTENT!
 BUT!
 IT JUST WON'T
 WORK ON ME!
 I AM THE
 PERSISTENTEST!
 AND IF YOU
 THINK YOU ARE
 PERSISTENESTER...
 THAT IS WRONG!
 GRAMATICALLY
 WRONG!
 BECAUSE THE
 CORRECT FORM
 WOULD BE...
 NOT AS
 PERSISTENTEST AS
 PAPYRUS, THE
 PERSISTENTESTEST!"
 I HOPE YOU
 ENJOYED THIS
 LESSON.
 YOU'RE BLUE NOW.
 THAT'S MY ATTACK!
 NYEH HEH HEH
 HEH HEH HEH
 HEH HEH HEH!!!
I SEE. I SEE.
YOU LIKE CARESSING
MY BICEPS WITH A
FLOATING HEART.
BUT WHO DOESN'T!?
TRY AGAIN!
THIS SHIRT DIDN'T
ORIGINALLY SAY
'COOL,' BUT I
IMPROVED IT.
EXPERT TIP: ALL
CLOTHING ARTICLES
CAN BE IMPROVED
THIS WAY.
BUT THAT'S NOT A
SECRET!!!
IT'S JUST GOOD
ADVICE!!!
HOLDING MY HAND
SO I'LL TELL
YOU THE ANSWER...
NO!!!
I MUST RESIST!!
THERE'S NO SECRET
TO MY LEGS.
JUST HARD WORK
AND PERSEVERANCE...
HUMAN SOULS ARE
STRONGER THAN
MONSTER SOULS...
BUT THE SOLES OF
OUR SHOES ON THE
OTHER HAND...!
... ARE ABOUT THE
SAME.
HAT DIALOGUE.
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE
RUNNING AWAY.
YOU'RE OVERWHELMED
BY THE SIGHT OF
MY COOL VIBES.
BUT YOU CAN'T
BACK DOWN NOW!!!
    
I WILL BATHE IN
A SHOWER OF KISSES
EVERY MORNING !
SO, AS I
WAS SAYING
ABOUT UNDYNE,
SO SANS!
WHEN'S THE HUMAN
SHOWING UP???
I WANT TO LOOK
MY SUNDAY BEST...

TELLING ME TO
LOOK AT A ROCK.

PAPYRUS, WILL

DELIVERED TO
THE CAPITAL!
THEN...
THEN!!!
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S NEXT.
IN ANY CASE!
CONTINUE...
ONLY IF YOU
DARE!!!
NOT A ROCK...?
OH NO!!!
BY PROCESS OF
ELIMINATION!!!
THAT MEANS IT'S
A HUMAN!!!
AHEM!!
HUMAN!!
PREPARE YOURSELF!!
FOR HIGH JINKS!
FOR LOW JINKS!
DANGERS!
PUZZLES!
CAPERS! JAPERS!
BEING CAPTURED!!
AND OTHER SORTS OF
FUN ACTIVITIES.
REFRESHMENTS WILL
BE PROVIDED...

DO I KNOW THAT
PERSON???
PBPBPPBPT!!
OF COURSE I KNOW
WHO I KNOW!!
I WANTED TO KNOW IF
YOU KNOW...
I KNOW WHO I KNOW
AS MUCH AS I KNOW
I KNOW WHO I KNOW!
...YOU KNOW?
OH-HO!
THE HUMAN
ARRIVES!
OH-HO!
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL!
IN ORDER TO
STOP YOU...
MY BROTHER AND
I HAVE CREATED
SOME PUZZLES!
I THINK YOU
WILL FIND
THIS ONE...
QUITE
SHOCKING!!!
FOR YOU SEE,
THIS IS THE
INVISIBLE...
ELECTRICITY
MAZE!!!
WHEN YOU TOUCH
THE WALLS OF
THIS MAZE,
THIS ORB WILL
ADMINISTER A
HEARTY ZAP!
SOUND LIKE
FUN???
BECAUSE!
THE AMOUNT OF
FUN YOU WILL
PROBABLY HAVE,
IS ACTUALLY
RATHER SMALL
I THINK.
OK, YOU CAN
GO AHEAD NOW.
SANS!!!
WHAT DID YOU
DO?!?!
OH, OKAY.
HOLD THIS PLEASE!
OKAY, TRY NOW!
INCREDIBLE!!
YOU SLIPPERY
SNAIL!!
YOU SOLVED IT
SO EASILY...
TOO EASILY!
HOWEVER!!
THE NEXT
PUZZLE WILL
NOT BE EASY!
IT IS DESIGNED
BY MY BROTHER,
SANS!
YOU WILL
SURELY BE
CONFOUNDED!
I KNOW I AM!
NYEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH!!
FOR YOU SEE,
THIS IS...
THE, INVISIBLE...
UHHHHHHH...?
HMMM... YOU MUST
BE HAVING
CULTURE SHOCK.
YOU SEE, WHERE I
COME FROM, IT'S
A LOVING TRADITION.
TO SUFFER THROUGH
HORRIBLE PUZZLES
FOR NO REASON.
SO, UH, JUST
WALK BACK THERE,
AND...
SIGH...
WHY COULDN'T WE GET
A HUMAN THAT LIKES
PUZZLES???
HUMAN!!!
I HOPE YOU'RE
READY FOR...
SANS!!
WHERE'S THE
PUZZLE!!!
WHAT THE HECK!!!
THEY DIDN'T SKIP
IT!?!?
I CAN'T WORK IN
THIS ENVIRONMENT!!
SANS!!!
THAT DID NOTHING!!!
WHAT?!?
JUNIOR JUMBLE!?
FINALLY, SOMETHING
WE CAN BOTH
AGREE ON.
IT WAS MADE
BY THE GREAT...
... ARE YOU
SERIOUS?
SANS!!!
HELP!!!
THEY KEEP WALKING
THROUGH MY PUZZLES!
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO LET ME
EXPLAIN THEM.
THEN THREATEN AND
BAFFLE THEM WITH
DANGEROUS JAPES.
EVERYONE LIKES
JAPES!!!
SHE HATES PUZZLES.
BUT SHE LOVES
JAPES.
HUMAN!!
WHAT DO YOU
THINK!?
PUZZLES OR JAPES?
OKAY, THIS IS
NORMALLY THE
PART.
WHERE YOU EITHER
AGREE OR DISAGREE.
AND DEPENDING ON
YOUR ANSWER.
WE SAY SOMETHING
GREAT IN RESPONSE.
HERE, WHY DON'T
YOU DO THIS
PUZZLE YOURSELF.
HUMAN!
HMMM...
HOW DO I SAY
THIS...
YOU WERE TAKING A
LONG TIME TO
ARRIVE, SO...
I DECIDED TO
IMPROVE THIS
PUZZLE...
BY ARRANGING THE
SNOW TO LOOK MORE
LIKE MY FACE.
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE SNOW FROZE
TO THE GROUND.
NOW THE SOLUTION
IS DIFFERENT!
AND,AS USUAL, MY
LAZY BROTHER IS
NOWHERE AROUND.
I SUPPOSE WHAT
I AM SAYING
IS...
WORRY NOT, HUMAN!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS, WILL SOLVE
THIS CONUNDRUM!
THEN WE CAN BOTH
PROCEED!
MEANWHILE, FEEL
FREE TO TRY THE
PUZZLE YOURSELF!
I'LL TRY NOT TO
GIVE AWAY THE
ANSWER!!!
WOW!!!
YOU SOLVED IT!!
AND YOU DID IT
ALL WITHOUT MY
HELP...
MY ADVICE HELPED!
IT REALLY HELPED
YOU!!
INCREDIBLE!
I'M IMPRESSED!!
YOU MUST CARE
ABOUT PUZZLES
LIKE I DO!
WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'LL LOVE THE
NEXT PUZZLE THEN!
IT MIGHT EVEN
BE TOO EASY FOR
YOU!!
NYEH!
HEH HEH!
HEHEHEH!!!
HUMAN!
THIS IS YOUR FINAL
AND MOST DANGEROUS
CHALLENGE!
BEHOLD!
THE GAUNTLET OF
DEADLY TERROR!
WHEN I SAY THE
WORD, IT WILL
FULLY ACTIVATE!!!
CANNONS WILL FIRE!
SPIKES WILL SWING!
BLADES WILL SLICE!
EACH PART WILL
SWING VIOLENTLY
UP AND DOWN!
ONLY THE TINIEST
CHANCE OF VICTORY
WILL REMAIN!!!
ARE YOU READY!?
I!
AM!
ABOUT!
TO DO IT!
HOLDUP!?
WHAT HOLDUP!?
I'M...
I'M ABOUT TO
ACTIVATE IT NOW!
WELL!!!
THIS CHALLENGE!!!
IT SEEMS...
MAYBE... TOO EASY
TO DEFEAT THE
HUMAN WITH.
YEAH!
WE CAN'T USE
THIS ONE!!!
I AM A SKELETON
WITH STANDARDS!!!
MY PUZZLES ARE
VERY FAIR!
AND MY TRAPS ARE
EXPERTLY COOKED!
BUT THIS METHOD
IS TOO DIRECT!
NO CLASS AT ALL!
AWAY IT GOES!
... THEY'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO WALK
THROUGH IT.
AND IT WON'T BE
ANY FUN AT ALL.
WELL. I MEAN.
I'M EXCITED TO
CAPTURE THEM.
SO I'LL BECOME
A FAMOUS ROYAL
GUARDSMAN!!!
BUT ALL THE TIME
I PUT INTO THESE
PUZZLES...
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THROWING A
BIRTHDAY PARTY...
EXACTLY!!
IT'S POINTLESS!!!
MAYBE YOU WERE
RIGHT TO BE LAZY
ABOUT PUZZLES.
YEAH!!
WHAT AM I SAYING!
YOU'RE STILL
COMPLETELY WRONG!
I JUST HAVE THE
WRONG AUDIENCE!
THINK ABOUT HOW
MUCH FUN UNDYNE
WOULD HAVE HERE!
FLAMES, VIOLENCE.
IT'S RIGHT UP HER
ALLEY!
SO I WON'T WASTE
THIS PUZZLE ON
YOU.
I JUST HAVE TO
APPRECIATE...
THE FRIEND I
ALREADY HAVE!!!
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT!?
THIS WAS ANOTHER
DECISIVE VICTORY
FOR PAPYRUS!!
NYEH!!
HEH!!
HEH???
A VALUABLE LIFE
LESSON!!!
HUMAN.
ALLOW ME TO TELL
YOU ABOUT SOME
COMPLEX FEELINGS.
SOMEHOW, I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND...
EVEN THOUGH I'VE
NEVER ACTUALLY MET
YOU BEFORE!!
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
WHY I FEEL THIS
WAY...
DID I MEET YOU
ONLINE???
I HAVE MANY "SOCIAL
MEDIA CONNECTIONS."
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
TRACK OF THEM
ALL.
JUST A DOZEN MORE,
AND...
I'LL FINALLY REACH
DOUBLE DIGITS!!!
... HEY, WAIT A
SECOND!
YOU CAN'T BE MY
FRIEND!!!
YOU'RE HUMAN!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
ALMOST TRICKED ME INTO
NOT DEFEATING YOU!!!
WHOOPSIE DOOPSIE!
FEELINGS LIKE...
THE JOY OF FINDING
ANOTHER PASTA
LOVER.
THE ADMIRATION FOR
ANOTHER'S PUZZLE-
SOLVING SKILLS.
THE DESIRE TO HAVE
A COOL, SMART PERSON
THINK YOU ARE COOL.
THESE FEELINGS...
THEY MUST BE WHAT
YOU ARE FEELING
RIGHT NOW!!!
I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE
WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE
TO FEEL THAT WAY.
AFTER ALL, I AM
VERY GREAT.
I DON'T EVER WONDER
WHAT HAVING LOTS
OF FRIENDS IS LIKE.
I PITY YOU...
LONELY HUMAN...
WORRY NOT!!!
YOU SHALL BE
LONELY NO LONGER!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS, WILL BE
YOUR...
 ...
NO...
NO, THIS IS ALL
WRONG!
I CAN'T BE YOUR
FRIEND!!!
YOU ARE A HUMAN!
I MUST CAPTURE
YOU!!!
THEN, I CAN FULFILL
MY LIFELONG DREAM!!!
POWERFUL!
POPULAR!
PRESTIGIOUS!!!
THAT'S PAPYRUS!!!
THE NEWEST MEMBER...
OF THE ROYAL GUARD!
OH...
WHERE COULD THAT
HUMAN HAVE GONE.
... WAIT...
IT'S RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME!!!
HELLO!
I WAS WORRIED THAT
YOU HAD GOTTEN LOST!
IT SURE IS A RELIEF
TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE...
... WAIT A SECOND!!!
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ESCAPE!!!
GET BACK THERE!!!
I SUPPOSE THIS PROVES
WHAT I SAID.
WE REALLY ARE BOUND
TOGETHER.
TWO BONES IN THE
SKELETAL ANATOMY OF
FATE!!!
THAT'S HOW YOU APPEAR
HERE NOW...
EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO ESCAPE.
AMAZING!!!
I FEEL A SINCERE...
WAAAAAIT A SECOND!!
I STILL HAVE TO
CAPTURE YOU!!!
WHOOPSIE-DOOPSIE!!
BACK AGAIN, EH?
I SUPPOSE IT'S MY
FAULT...
I TOLD YOU BEFORE
THAT I WOULD MAKE
YOU SPAGHETTI.
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT YOU WOULD
WANT TO SEE ME...
IN THE DIRE HOPE
THAT I WOULD MAKE
YOU SOME.
WELL... I UNDERSTAND.
PAPYRUS IS HUNGRY,
TOO!
HUNGRY FOR JUSTICE!
HALT, HUMAN!
I WAS NEVER ONE
  TO BEPIS.
OH, I ALMOST
FORGOT TO TELL
YOU...
TO REACH THE EXIT,
YOU WILL HAVE
TO PASS...
THROUGH THE KING'S
CASTLE.
TO REACH THE EXIT,
YOU WILL HAVE
TO MEET...
THE KING.
THE KING OF
ALL MONSTERS...
HE IS...
... WELL...
HE'S A BIG FUZZY
PUSHOVER!!!
EVERYBODY LOVES
THAT GUY.
I AM CERTAIN IF
YOU JUST SAY...
EXCUSE ME, MR.
DREEMURR... CAN I
PLEASE GO HOME?
HE'LL GUIDE YOU
RIGHT TO THE
BARRIER HIMSELF!
ANYWAY!!!
THAT'S ENOUGH
TALKING!!!
I'LL BE AT HOME
BEING A COOL
FRIEND!!!
FEEL FREE TO
COME BY AND
HANG OUT!!!
FEEL FREE TO
COME BY AND HAVE
THAT DATE!
NYEH HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH!!!
HEY, QUIT MOVING
WHILE I'M TALKING
TO YOU!
I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS,
HAVE SOME THINGS
TO SAY.
FIRST: YOU'RE A
FREAKING WEIRDO!
NOT ONLY DO YOU
NOT LIKE PUZZLES.
BUT THE WAY YOU
SHAMBLE ABOUT FROM
PLACE TO PLACE...
THE WAY YOUR HANDS
ARE ALWAYS COVERED
IN DUSTY POWDER.
IT FEELS...
LIKE YOUR LIFE IS
GOING DOWN A
DANGEROUS PATH.
HOWEVER!
I, PAPYRUS, SEE
GREAT POTENTIAL
WITHIN YOU!
EVERYONE CAN BE
A GREAT PERSON
IF THEY TRY!
AND ME, I HARDLY
HAVE TO TRY AT
ALL!!!
NYEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH!!!
HEY, QUIT MOVING!
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I AM TALKING
ABOUT!
HUMAN! I THINK
YOU ARE IN NEED
OF GUIDANCE!
SOMEONE NEEDS TO
KEEP YOU ON THE
STRAIGHT AND NARROW!
BUT WORRY NOT!
I, PAPYRUS...
WILL GLADLY BE
YOUR FRIEND AND
TUTOR!
I WILL TURN YOUR
LIFE RIGHT
AROUND!!!
I SEE YOU ARE
APPROACHING.
ARE YOU OFFERING A
HUG OF ACCEPTANCE?
WOWIE!! MY LESSONS
ARE ALREADY
WORKING!!
I, PAPYRUS,
WELCOME YOU
WITH OPEN ARMS!
COME ON!
DON'T BE SO
RUDE!!!
I SET UP
THIS PUZZLE
JUST FOR YOU!
DO YOU TREAT
YOUR MOTHER
THIS WAY...
WHEN SHE MAKES
YOU A PUZZLE

HUMANS...
SANS!!!!
THE HUMAN IS
ESCAPING!!!
YOU MADE THE
PUZZLE TOO
HARD!!
HEY YOU!!!
GET BACK HERE!
YOU KNOW WHAT
"SUP," BROTHER!
IT'S BEEN EIGHT
DAYS AND YOU
STILL HAVEN'T...
RECALIBRATED.
YOUR.
PUZZLES!
YOU JUST HANG
AROUND OUTSIDE
YOUR STATION!
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING?!?
NO!!
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT!!
WHAT IF A HUMAN
COMES THROUGH
HERE!?!
I WANT TO BE
READY!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE!
I MUST BE THE ONE!
I WILL CAPTURE A
HUMAN!
THEN, I, THE
GREAT PAPYRUS...
WILL GET
ALL THE THINGS I
UTTERLY DESERVE!
RESPECT...
RECOGNITION...
I WILL FINALLY
BE ABLE TO JOIN
THE ROYAL GUARD!
PEOPLE WILL ASK,
TO, BE MY,
"FRIEND?"
I WILL BATHE IN A
SHOWER OF KISSES
EVERY MORNING.
SANS!! YOU ARE
NOT HELPING!!
YOU LAZYBONES!!
ALL YOU DO IS SIT
AND BOONDOGGLE!
YOU GET LAZIER
AND LAZIER
EVERY DAY!!!
SANS!!!
I AM AND I HATE IT!
WHY DOES SOMEONE
AS GREAT AS ME...
HAVE TO DO SO MUCH
JUST TO GET SOME
RECOGNITION...
UGH!!!
I WILL ATTEND TO
MY PUZZLES...
AS FOR YOUR WORK?
PUT A LITTLE MORE,
"BACKBONE" INTO
IT!!!!
NYEHEHEHEHEHE
HEHEHEHEHEHE!!!
HEH!
SANS!!!
HAVE YOU FOUND A
HUMAN YET!??!
REALLY!?!?
WOWIE!!!
GUESS THAT'S
SETTLED!!
MY BROTHER STARTED
A SOCK COLLECTION
RECENTLY.
HOW SADDENING...
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT HE WOULD
DO...
WITHOUT SUCH A
COOL GUY TAKING
CARE OF HIM???
SO, YOU WANT
A HINT, HUH?
WELL...
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE PUZZLE...
AND I THINK THE
SOLUTION...
IS TO TURN ALL
OF THE X'S INTO
O'S!
YOU SHOULD TRY
THAT!
ASK AGAIN FOR
MORE GREAT HINTS!
MAYBE SOLVING
THE LAST PUZZLE 
AGAIN WILL HELP.
ASK AGAIN FOR
MORE GREAT HINTS!!
I ASKED UNDYNE
IF WE COULD
ALL HANG...
BUT SHE SAID
SOMETHING WEIRD.
SHE SAID SHE
WON'T HANG OUT
WITH A MURDERER.
BUT... HMM...
I DON'T REMEMBER
MURDERERING
ANYONE...
THOUGH I AM A
PRETTY BRUTAL
KIND OF GUY.
THEN SHE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT
WANTING TO...
FIGHT SOME KIND
OF BAD GUY.
BUT SHE SEEMS
VERY... WEAK
FROM SOMETHING.
SHE STEPPED OUT
AND COLLAPSED IN
THE DOORWAY.
SO I'M JUST
WAITING HERE IN
CASE SHE NEEDS ME.
SINCE SHE HATES
BEING WAITED ON
HAND AND FOOT.
I THINK WE'LL
HAVE TO HANG
OUT LATER...
HEY, I...
REALLY DOUBT
WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO HANG.
IT'S HARD TO
IMAGINE, BUT...
YOU'LL HAVE TO
SPEND TIME WITH
NOT ME.
HEY! READY TO
HANG OUT WITH
UNDYNE???
GREAT!!!
ME TOO!!!
HOWEVER, SHE'S
NOT HERE.
NORMALLY SHE
RETURNS AT ABOUT
THIS TIME.
SHE'S LATE
THOUGH...
AND SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER
PHONE.
HOW STRANGE.
I'LL JUST WAIT
HERE UNTIL SHE
GETS HOME.
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN SHE GETS
HERE, OKAY!?
NOPE!!
SHE ISN'T HERE
YET!!!
UNDYNE'S HOME,
BUT SHE ISN'T
FEELING WELL.
I DON'T THINK WE
CAN HANG OUT.
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE
CAUGHT HEAT-STROKE
OR SOMETHING.
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
BROUGHT HER
BACK HOME...
BECAUSE SHE CAN
BARELY MOVE.
BUT SHE IS
MUTTERING ABOUT
DESTROYING YOU.
SO THAT'S A GOOD
VITAL SIGN.
IN ANY CASE, I
DON'T THINK WE
CAN HANG OUT.
I'M JUST WAITING
HERE IN CASE
SHE NEEDS ME.
SO, I GUESS YOU
CAN RUN ALONG.
UNDYNE IS SICK,
SO SHE CAN'T
PLAY TODAY.
GREAT!!!
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
EVEN HERE.
BEING READY EARLY!
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH
YOU CARE!!
EVEN IF SHE'S
NOT HERE TO SEE
THAT.
HELLO, MY FRIEND.
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO PAPYRUS TOWN?
HELLO...
H-HOW ARE YOU,
MY F-FRIEND?
I'M FEELING VERY
NOT SUSPICIOUS
TODAY.
HEY, I HAVE A
GREAT IDEA.
LET'S HANG OUT
WITH UNDYNE
LATER.
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I'M READY!
I'M SO GLAD YOU
AND UNDYNE ARE
FRIENDS NOW.
YOU TWO GO
TOGETHER LIKE
PASTA AND BURNING!
OH, HEY...
YOU'RE LEAVING
SOON, RIGHT!?
DON'T COME HERE
TO SAY GOODBYE!!
GOODBYES AREN'T
ALLOWED IN MY
TOWN.
JUST SEE-YOU-
LATERS.
IT SEEMS UNDYNE
HAS SOMETHING
FOR YOU.
SHE'S THE PERSON
THAT'S NOT ME.
UNDYNE WRITES A
LOT OF LETTERS.
BUT, SHE CAN NEVER
SEEM TO FIND THE
RIGHT WORDS.
SO WHEN SHE GOES
TO DELIVER THEM
HERSELF...
SHE ALWAYS QUITS
SO SHE CAN GO
BACK AND REWRITE.
THAT'S WHY SHE
ASKED YOU!!
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NO STANDARDS!!!
ALPHYS SEEMS TO
HAVE DISAPPEARED.
DON'T WORRY, THAT'S
NORMAL.
YOU SHOULD GO
TO HER LAB.
I'M SUPPOSED TO
PUT THESE
NUMBERS TOGETHER.
WELCOME TO SCENIC
MY HOUSE!
ENJOY AND TAKE
YOUR TIME!!!
WOW!
BEING A GOOD HOST
IS A REAL WORKOUT!
I CAN'T FEEL MY
LEGS...
THAT MUST MEAN
I'M BEING A
GREAT HOST!!!
TAKE A LOOK
AROUND!
SO YOU CAME
BACK TO HAVE A
DATE WITH ME!
SO YOU CAME
BACK TO SEE ME!
YOU MUST BE
REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS...
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE
YOU SOMEPLACE
REALLY SPECIAL...
A PLACE I LIKE
TO SPEND A LOT
OF TIME!!!
MY HOUSE!!!
HERE, UNDYNE.
MY FRIEND BROUGHT
A GIFT FOR YOU,
ON THEIR OWN!
WHOOPSY DOOPSY!
I JUST REMEMBERED!
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM!!
YOU TWO HAVE
FUN!!!
DANG!
WHAT A SHAME...
I THOUGHT UNDYNE
COULD BE FRIENDS
WITH YOU.
BUT I GUESS...
I OVERESTIMATED
HER.
SHE'S JUST NOT
UP TO THE
CHALLENGE.
PSST.
MAKE SURE TO
GIVE HER THIS!
SHE LOVES THESE!
YOU BET I AM!
AND I BROUGHT
A FRIEND!
NO!
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
FRIENDSHIP!!
H... HI, UNDYNE!
I'M HERE WITH MY
DAILY REPORT...
UHHH... REGARDING THAT
HUMAN I CALLED YOU
ABOUT EARLIER...
I THINK, UH...
HOW DO I...
... HUH?
DID I FIGHT THEM?
Y-YES!
OF COURSE I DID!
I FOUGHT THEM
VALIANTLY!
...WHAT?
DID I CAPTURE THEM...?
W-W-WELL...
NO.
I TRIED VERY HARD,
UNDYNE, BUT IN THE
END...
I FAILED.
... W-WHAT?
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE HUMAN'S SOUL
YOURSELF...
BUT UNDYNE, YOU DON'T
H-HAVE TO DESTROY
THEM! YOU SEE...
YOU SEE...
...
...
... I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL HELP YOU IN
ANY WAY I CAN.
 
... I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL HELP YOU IN
ANY WAY I CAN.
WHAT!!
I DIDN'T CRY!!!
I DON'T CRY!!
I JUST...
CAUGHT SOMETHING
IN MY EYE.
TEARS!!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE QUEEN HAS
RETURNED...
AND ALSO THAT
SHE'S A HUGE
DORK!!!
YOU TWO ARE TWO
FEET AWAY FROM
EACH OTHER!!!
WHY ARE YOU
TEXTING!!!
WHY IS THAT.
HAHAHA, WOW!
THOSE PUNS ARE
EVEN LESS FUNNY
COMING FROM HER!
IT'S A PITY
SMILE!!!
WOW, FRISK...
THIS REALLY PUTS
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IN A NEW LIGHT.
IT'S NOT???
WHATEVER, MOM!!!
OK, UNDYNE.
I'M GETTING MIXED
  MESSAGES HERE!!!
COOKING???
CAN I HELP?
BUT YOU AREN'T
  WORKING!!!
* A-ACHOO!
I HAVE NO SKIN.
BECAUSE I HATE
GREASE.
NO, BUT I HAVE
STANDARDS!!!
THE RENT'S CHEAP.
YEAH, BUT MY
BROTHER PAYS
FOR IT.
OH, THAT'S SIMPLE.
IT'S A MYSTERY.
SO, ASGORE...
HOW ABOUT MAKING
ME A MEMBER OF
THE ROYAL GUARD?
WHAT!?
THEN WHAT WAS
THE POINT OF THE
HUMAN'S QUEST!?
THEY JOURNEYED
ALL THAT WAY...
AND I'M STILL
NOT A MEMBER OF
THE ROYAL GUARD!?
TRULY, THIS IS
THE WORST
POSSIBLE ENDING.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU
REALLY BOTCHED
YOUR QUEST, FRISK.
BUT, I, THE
GREAT PAPYRUS...
WILL ALWAYS BE
YOUR FRIEND!!!
HEY!
THAT'S TRUE.
FRISK, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE A WALK
AROUND?
YEAH, FRISK, WHY
DON'T YOU FLY?
FRISK...
TAKE A HIKE.
HIKING IS GOOD
FOR YOUR BONES.
WAIT, ALPHYS, I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU
KNEW SANS.
THIS IS MY BROTHER'S
PET ROCK.
HE ALWAYS FORGETS
TO FEED IT.
AS USUAL, I HAVE
TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.
ISN'T THAT FLAG
NEATO?
UNDYNE FOUND IT
AT THE BAY...
I THINK IT'S FROM
THE HUMAN WORLD?
NOW, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING.
WHY WOULD A
HUMAN FLAG...
HAVE A COOL
SKELETON ON IT?
WELL...
I HAVE A THEORY.
I THINK HUMANS...
MUST HAVE
DESCENDED FROM
SKELETONS!!!
PLEASE DON'T ENTER
THE MYSTERIOUS
SHACK.
HELLO.
THAT'S NOT
MY HOUSE.
THAT'S JUST MY
COOL TOOLSHED.
NO!!!
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT!!!
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
FRIENDS,
UNDYNE.
YOU ENRICH MY
LIFE WITH SHED-
BASED PUNS.
READY FOR ANOTHER
NIGHT IN THE
PUNISHMENT SHACK?
READY FOR ANOTHER
NIGHT IN THE
PUNISHMENT SHACK?
DON'T BE SO
JUDGMENTAL,
UNDYNE.
MY SHACK IS A
FOUR STAR
ESTABLISHMENT.
WHAT!?!?
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
YOU SHOULD LEARN
A PRIVACY.
A CLASSIC IMAGE.
IT ALWAYS REMINDS
ME OF WHAT'S
IMPORTANT IN LIFE.
HEY, SANS, HAVE
YOU SEEN MY...
OH, HELLO.
YOU AREN'T SANS.
WAIT A SECOND.
WHY WERE YOU USING
A TREADMILL IN
THE DARK?
IS SANS PRANKING
YOU ACROSS TIME
AND SPACE?
I HATE IT WHEN
HE DOES THAT!
HOW IMMATURE CAN
YOU GET?
ALSO, HAVE YOU
SEEN MY ACTION
FIGURES?
WAIT!
I KNOW WHERE TO
LOOK!!!
IN MY COLLECTION!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
SOMETIMES, I'M A
GENIUS.
ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S THE TRASH
CAN.
FEEL FREE TO VISIT
IT ANY TIME.
AH-HA!
INTERESTED IN
MY FOOD MUSEUM?
PLEASE.
PERUSE MY
CULINARY ARTSHOW.
GREAT FRIDGE,
ISN'T IT?
THAT'S MY BED!
IF I EVER GET
TO THE SURFACE...
I'D LIKE TO
DRIVE DOWN A
LONG HIGHWAY.
WIND IN MY
HAIR...
SUN ON MY
SKIN...
OF COURSE, THAT'S
JUST A DREAM.
SO INSTEAD I
CRUISE WHILE I
SNOOZE.
WHY ARE YOU SO
INTERESTED IN MY
BED?
ARE YOU TIRED?
THAT BOOK'S ONE
OF MY
FAVORITES.
ADVANCED PUZZLE
CONSTRUCTION FOR
CRITICAL MINDS.
THAT NEXT BOOK'S
ANOTHER ONE OF
MY FAVORITES.
PEEK-A-BOO WITH
FLUFFY BUNNY.
THE ENDING
ALWAYS GETS ME.
THE INTERNET!
I'M QUITE
POPULAR THERE.
I'M JUST A
DOZEN AWAY...
FROM A DOUBLE
DIGIT FOLLOWER
COUNT!
OF COURSE, FAME
HAS A STEEP
PRICE.
A JEALOUS TROLL
HAS BESIEGED MY
ONLINE PERSONA.
ALWAYS SENDING
ME BAD PUNS IN
A GOOFY FONT...
AH, YES, ACTION
FIGURES.
A GREAT REFERENCE
FOR THEORETICAL
BATTLE SCENARIOS.
HOW DO I HAVE
SO MANY?
WELL, LET'S JUST
SAY THEY'RE
FROM...
A CHUBBY, SMILING
MAN WHO LOVES TO
SURPRISE PEOPLE.
YEAH!!
THAT'S RIGHT!
SANTA!!!!
HEY, THOSE ARE ALL
THE ATTACKS I USED
ON YOU.
GREAT MEMORIES,
HUH?
SEEMS LIKE IT
WAS ONLY
YESTERDAY...
EVEN THOUGH
IT BASICALLY
JUST HAPPENED.
HEY, THOSE ARE ALL
THE ATTACKS I
DIDN'T USE.
HOW LUCKY OF YOU!
HAD I ONLY USED
MY SPECIAL ATTACK,
YOU SURELY WOULD
HAVE BEEN BLASTED
TO...
HEY. WAIT.
WHERE'S MY SPECIAL
ATTACK?
NO! I'VE BEEN
DOGBURGLED BY THAT
PERNICIOUS PUP!
THAT LOATHESOME
SCOUNDREL LOVES TO
SNEAK INTO MY ROOM.
SOMETIMES IT EVEN
CRAWLS INTO MY BED
WHILE I'M RESTING.
IF THAT WASN'T
BAD ENOUGH, IT HAS
VERY COLD FEET.
WOW, YOU'RE SO
EAGER TO DATE
ME...
WOW, YOU'RE SO
EAGER TO HANG
OUT...
YOU'RE TRYING TO
GO INTO MY HOUSE
WITHOUT ME!
THAT'S REALLY
WEIRD!!!
IMPRESSED?
I INCREASED THE
HEIGHT OF MY SINK.
NOW I CAN FIT MORE
BONES UNDER IT!
TAKE A LOOKSY!
FORGET IT.
WHAT!?!?
CATCH THAT
MEDDLING CANINE!
CURSES!!!
STOP PLAGUING MY
LIFE WITH INCIDENTAL
MUSIC!!!
OOH, IT'S MY
FAVORITE
GAME-SHOW!
WHAT!!!
IT'S USUALLY
BETTER THAN THIS!
THIS IS JUST
A BAD EPISODE!!!
DON'T JUDGE ME!!!
HOW NICE OF YOU
TO CHECK MY MAIL
FOR ME.
WAIT, NO.
THAT'S VERY
STRANGE.
STOP LOOKING IN
MY EMPTY
MAILBOX.
THAT'S MY
EMPTINESS, NOT
YOURS.
YEAH, UNDYNE'S
GOT A POINT!
WHY DIDN'T SHE
WRITE A LETTER
TO ME INSTEAD?
OH NO!!!
WHAT'S THE F
FOR?
HEY!
NOBODY FIGHT
ANYONE!
IF ANYONE FIGHTS
ANYONE...!
THEN I'LL!!!
BE FORCED!!!
TO ASK UNDYNE
FOR HELP!!!
OH!
HELLO, YOUR
MAJESTY!
PSST!
HEY, HUMAN...
DID ASGORE
SHAVE...?
AND...
CLONE HIMSELF????
WOWIE...
I CAN'T BELIEVE
ASGORE'S CLONE
KNOWS WHO I
AM!!!
THIS IS THE BEST
DAY OF MY
LIFE!!!!!!!
HMMM...
SNOW-PROOF ROOF
TILES???
I CHANGED MY
MIND!!!
THIS IS THE WORST
DAY OF MY LIFE!!!
LET'S
JUST
SAY...
A TINY
FLOWER
HELPED
ME.
THAT'S RIGHT,
HUMAN!
YOU CAN
WIN!!
JUST DO
WHAT I,
WOULD
DO...
BELIEVE
IN YOU!!!

HELLO!
THIS IS PAPYRUS!!!
HOW DID I GET THIS
NUMBER...?
IT WAS EASY!!!
I JUST DIALED EVERYNUMBER SEQUENTIALLYUNTIL I GOT YOURS!!!
NYEH HEH HEH HEH!!
SO...
WHAT ARE YOU
WEARING...?
I'M...
ASKING FOR A
FRIEND.
SHE THOUGHT SHE
SAW YOU WEARING A
.
IS THAT TRUE?
ARE YOU WEARING A
?
SO YOU ARE WEARING
A 
...
GOT IT!!!
WINK WINK!!!
HAVE A NICE DAY!
SO YOU AREN'T
WEARING A
GOT IT!
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,
SO I TRUST YOU
100-PERCENT.
REMEMBER WHEN
I ASKED YOU
ABOUT CLOTHES?
WELL, THE FRIEND
WHO WANTED TO
KNOW...
HER OPINION OF
YOU IS VERY...
MURDERY.
ERROR!!!
SEE YOU LATER!
BUT I BET YOU
KNEW THAT
ALREADY!
AND BECAUSE YOU
KNEW THAT...
I TOLD HER WHAT
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE WEARING!
A 
!
BECAUSE I KNEW,
OF COURSE...
AFTER SUCH A
SUSPICIOUS
QUESTION...
YOU WOULD
OBVIOUSLY CHANGE
YOUR CLOTHES!
YOU'RE SUCH A
SMART COOKIE!
THIS WAY YOU'RE
SAFE AND I
DIDN'T LIE!!!
NO BETRAYAL
ANYWHERE!!!
BEING FRIENDS
WITH EVERYONE
IS EASY!!!
WELL, WORRY
NOT DEAR HUMAN!
PAPYRUS WOULD
NEVER BETRAY YOU!
I AM NOT A
CRUEL PERSON.
I STRIVE TO BE
COMFORTING AND
PLEASANT.
PAPYRUS!
HE SMELLS LIKE
THE MOON.
SO, BECAUSE OF
MY INHERENT
GOODNESS...
I TOLD HER YOU
WERE NOT WEARING
A 
EVEN THOUGH YOU
TOLD ME YOU
WERE!
INSTEAD, I MADE
SOMETHING UP!
I TOLD HER YOU
WERE WEARING...
A 
IT PAINED ME TO
TELL SUCH A
BOLDFACED LIE.
I KNOW YOU WOULD
NEVER EVER WEAR
A 
BUT YOUR SAFETY
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FASHION.
DANG!
I JUST WANT TO
BE FRIENDS WITH
EVERYONE...
PAPYRUS WOULD
NEVER BETRAY YOU!
YOU SAID YOU WERE 
NOT WEARING A
.
SO OF COURSE
I ACTUALLY
TOLD HER...
YOU WERE
INDEED WEARING
A 
BUT SINCE YOU
AREN'T WEARING
A 
SHE SURELY
WON'T ATTACK
YOU!
NOW YOU ARE
SAFE AND SOUND.
WOWIE...
THIS IS HARD.
I JUST WANT TO
BE EVERYBODY'S
FRIEND!
I KNEW WHEN
YOU SAID:
"I AM NOT
WEARING A
."
IT WAS REALLY
A SECRET CODE!
YOU REALLY
MEANT...
"I ACTUALLY AM
WEARING
A 
!"
YOU WERE TRYING
TO PROTECT
YOURSELF...
WHILE MAKING IT
SO I DIDN'T
HAVE TO LIE!
I PICKED UP ON
THIS, AND FOLLOWED
YOUR PLAN.
IN FACT I TOOK
IT ONE STEP
FURTHER!
I TOLD HER YOU
WERE PROBABLY...
WEARING A
OF COURSE, YOU
WOULD NEVER
WEAR THAT.
BUT THAT'S THE
POINT!
SHE WON'T
RECOGNIZE YOU
NOW!
AND I DIDN'T
HAVE TO BETRAY
EITHER OF YOU!
SINCE I JUST
TOLD HER WHAT
YOU SAID!
WOWIE!
YOU'RE SUCH A
SMART COOKIE!
I REALLY CAN
BE FRIENDS WITH
EVERYONE!!!
HEY!
WHAT'S UP!?
I WAS JUST
THINKING...
YOU, ME, AND
UNDYNE SHOULD ALL
HANG OUT SOMETIME!
I THINK YOU
WOULD MAKE
GREAT PALS!
LET'S MEET UP
AT HER HOUSE
LATER!
AFTER YOU HANG
OUT WITH ME...
LET'S MEET UP
AT HER HOUSE!
HMMMM...
THE STRANGE DOOR
IN THE WOODS.
ACTUALLY,
MY BROTHER SPENDS
A LOT OF TIME HERE.
WHAT'S HE DOING...?
I'VE GOT TO KEEP
HIM ON THE STRAIGHT
AND NARROW!!!
ARE YOU STILL
AROUND THAT DOOR?
OH NO!!!
MY BROTHER'S A
BAD INFLUENCE!!!
THIS IS WHERE MY
BROTHER IS SUPPOSED
TO PATROL...
BUT, EVERY TIME I
SHOW UP, HE'S
SLACKING OFF.
IT'S A GOOD THING
I SPOTTED YOU
FIRST!
I'M SURE HE WOULD
HAVE MADE A WEIRD
FIRST IMPRESSION.
IF HE'S NOT AROUND,
HE WON'T COME
BACK...
THAT'S JUST THE
WAY HE FUNCTIONS.
WHAT???
ARE YOU LOST???
HMMM... YOU SHOULD
TRY CALLING
SOMEONE FOR HELP!
HUH???
WHY ARE YOU
CALLING ME??
IT'S TOO COLD
TO SWIM IN THE
RIVER.
UNLESS YOU HAVE A
WATERPROOF
SWEATER!
IT'S JUST A
RIVER.
NYEH HEH HEH!!
IMPRESSED!?!
NOT ONLY AM I
GREAT AT PUZZLES...
BUT I'M ALSO
AN ESTEEMED
ARCHITECT!!!
MY BROTHER HELPED
ME FIND THE BOX!
THE STATION OF
DOGGO.
HE HAS THE AMAZING
POWER TO SEE THINGS
WHEN THEY MOVE.
OKAY, MAYBE IT'S
NOT AN AMAZING
POWER.
DOGGO'S NOT HOME.
CAREFUL!!
THE ICE IS
SLPPERY.
BUT IF YOU SLIDE
ON THE ICE, NO ONE
WILL ATTACK YOU.
NO ONE WANTS TO
PRATFALL DURING A
COOL TECHNIQUE.
I'M COLD OUT OF
THINGS TO SAY.
IT MUST BE TOUGH
BEING A SNOWMAN.
TRY TO BE NICE
TO PEOPLE MADE OF
STRANGE MATERIALS.
IS THAT SNOWMAN
STILL THERE?
OH HO!
THE ELECTRIC MAZE!
THAT SURE WAS FUN!
EXCEPT FOR WHEN
I GOT SHOCKED.
OH HO!
THE ELECTRIC MAZE!
A GREAT PUZZLE!
EXCEPT FOR THE
PART WHERE WE
DIDN'T EVEN DO IT.
MINUS THAT ONE
TINY FLAW, IT'S AN
EASY 10 OUT OF 10!
DISAPPOINTING, BUT
I TURNED OFF THE
ELECTRICITY.
THE FAMOUS SNOWDIN
SNOWBALL GAME.
FASTER COMPLETION
GIVES DIFFERENT
PRIZES.
WHERE DOES THE
MONEY COME FROM?
THE SNOWBALL TAX,
OF COURSE!!
WHAT?
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF A SNOWBALL TAX?
THE SURFACE WORLD
MUST BE PARADISE...
THE STATION OF THE
MARRIED DOGS...
HMMM. DO YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT DOING
THAT SOMEDAY?
MARRYING A DOG?
NAH...
THAT'S WEIRD.
THERE ARE WAY
BETTER ANIMALS TO
MARRY.
LIKE SKELETONS!!!
HMM... CROSSWORD.
I GUESS IT'S AN
APT NAME.
THOSE WORDS MAKE
ME CROSS!!!
ARE YOU STILL
LOOKING AT THAT
WORD SEARCH?
AH, THE SPAGHETTI
TRAP ROOM...
ERROR????
I STILL HAVE TO
GO VISIT IT...
THE SPAGHETTI YOU
LEFT ME IS STILL
THERE!!!
WELL, I GUESS IT'S
NOT MUCH OF A
TRAP ANYMORE...
SINCE YOU ATE THE
WHOLE THING,
RIGHT!?
NOTHING LIKE A
HOT BUCKET OF
SPAGH...
THIS ROOM IS
NORMALLY BLOCKED
BY THOSE SPIKES.
BUT WE'RE THINKING
OF GETTING RID
OF THEM...
THE KING RELEASED
A MANDATE ON
PUZZLES RECENTLY.
HE THINKS SPIKES
ARE INEFFECTIVE AND
HAZARDOUS TO KIDS.
BUT I THINK HE'S
WRONG!!!
KIDS LOVE DEADLY
SPIKES!!!
IF YOU KNOW ANY
KIDS, YOU SHOULD
ASK THEM!!!
HMMM...
THE SOLUTION TO
THIS ONE...?
I ACTUALLY JUST
STEPPED OVER THE
SPIKES.
SO THE SOLUTION
IS TO BE VERY
TALL AND HANDSOME.
I'M SOLVING IT
AS WE SPEAK...
OH-HO!!! 
THIS PUZZLE!
YOU FIGURED IT OUT
SO EASILY!!
THAT WAS VERY
PAPYRUS OF YOU.
TALKING ON THE
PHONE... HOW
PAPYRUS OF YOU.
OH-HO!!!
THE PUZZLE THAT
DR. ALPHYS MADE!
I HAD TO ASK
UNDYNE TO ASK
HER TO MAKE ONE.
I ONLY FOLLOW
HER ONLINE...
I'M NOT REALLY
FRIENDS WITH HER...
YET!!!!
SOMEDAY I'LL
IMPRESS HER WITH
MY HUGE BICEPS...
THAT'S A GOOD
WAY TO MAKE
FRIENDS!!!
THE STATION OF
LESSERDOG.
THIS DOG LOVES
TO BE PET.
THAT'S ITS DEFINING
PERSONALITY
TRAIT.
WAIT, WHY ARE THEY
A ROYAL GUARD
AND NOT ME!?
I LOVE TO BE
PET TOO!!!
SIGH...
IT'S ALL JUST A
PUPULARITY CONTEST.
WE WERE GETTING
BORED WAITING
FOR YOU...
SO I BUILT A
SNOW-PAPYRUS!
AND SANS...
DID HIS THING.
ACTUALLY, IT'S ONE
OF HIS BETTER
LUMPS.
I ALWAYS JUMP OVER
THE GAP INSTEAD OF
SOLVING THE PUZZLE.
SANS NEVER SOLVES
IT EITHER.
HE ALWAYS JUST...
UM...
GETS ACROSS.
I THINK HE HAS
A SHORTCUT OR
SOMETHING.
GYFTROT LIVES NEAR
THERE.
THEY LIKE GIFTS.
DON'T WORRY IF
YOU CAN'T AFFORD
SOMETHING NICE.
IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.
SO IMAGINE YOU
HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY...
DID YOU MEET
GYFTROT?
MY SIGNAL IS
GETTING WEAK.
LOOKS LIKE THE
PHONE WON'T WORK
PAST HERE.
SO THERE'S NO
REASON TO GO
FURTHER.
HELLO.
THE STATION OF
GREATERDOG.
HE LOOKS A BIT
LIKE A CERTAIN DOG
I DON'T LIKE.
BUT GREATERDOG
DOESN'T COLLECT
ANYTHING.
HE'S ONLY A
KLEPTOMANIAC
FOR AFFECTION!
HE'S AMASSED A
LARGE COLLECTION
OF HUGS AND PETS.
THIS BRIDGE LOOKS
DANGEROUS, BUT
IT'S VERY STABLE.
IN FACT, IT'S JUST
A ROCK FORMATION
I PAINTED OVER.
I THINK IT LOOKS
MORE DRAMATIC
THAT WAY.
I ADDED THE ROPE,
TOO.
SNOWDIN...
HOME OF PAPYRUS!
THAT'S THE SLOGAN,
RIGHT???
I'M PETITIONING TO
CHANGE THE SLOGAN.
THAT FURRY PERSON
THROWS ICE ALL
DAY.
NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE IT GOES.
NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE IT GOES.
WOW, UNDYNE!!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
LIKED NERDY STUFF!
JUST STRENGTH
AND FIGHTING...
HYPNOTIZING, ISN'T
IT???
THE INN'S A
GREAT PLACE
TO STAY.
THE LADY WHO
RUNS IT IS
REALLY NICE.
SHE ALWAYS GIVES
ME A LOLLIPOP AND
A PAT ON THE HEAD.
WHY ARE YOU
CALLING ME?
ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE A
RESERVATION???
GRILLBY'S...
IT'S DARK AND FULL
OF GREASE.
PURGATORY OF
FRIES...
HAMBURGER ABYSS...
ANYWAY, MY BROTHER
PRACTICALLY LIVES
HERE.
I'M NOT COMING
TO GRILLBY'S.
GRILLBY'S? WE'RE TOO
REFINED FOR THAT
GREASEHOLE.
JUST MONOLOGUING
ABOUT MY LOVE
FOR GREASE!!!
OUR FEELINGS FOR
GREASE RUN DEEP
LIKE A RIVER.
I LOVE THE LIBRARY.
THE BOOKS ARE ALL
ARRANGED BY COLOR..
THIS SENSE OF
ORDER!!! IT FILLS
ME WITH POWER!
WHAT'S A LIBRARY
CARD?
WOW! IT ONLY TOOK
YOU FOUR SECONDS
TO CALL ME!!
YOU MUST BE VERY
DESPERATE FOR MY
HELP!!!
WELL! DO NOT FEAR!
THIS IS PAPYRUS'S
HOTFUL HELPLINE!
JUST DESCRIBE YOUR
LOCATION, AND...!
I WILL DESCRIBE
SOME HOT TIPS!
SO, WHERE ARE
YOU?
...
... YOU'RE STILL
IN MY ROOM??
HAVE YOU HEARD OF
SOMETHING CALLED
A... DOOR?
WAIT! DON'T WORRY!
I'LL DRAW A
DIAGRAM FOR YOU!
HOLD UP!
I'M STILL DRAWING!
WHAT? I THOUGHT
YOU HAD GOTTEN OUT
OF MY ROOM.
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO START OVER
FROM SQUARE ONE!
FIRST: DO YOU
KNOW WHO PAPYRUS
IS!?
DO I KNOW WHO
PAPYRUS IS!?
YOU'RE IN MY
HOUSE.
GOOD CHOICE!
THOUGH I GUESS
IT'S TECHNICALLY
SANS'S HOUSE TOO.
BUT I PREFER NOT
TO DISCUSS HIS
PART OF IT.
HIS ROOM IS...
IT'S LIKE ANOTHER
WORLD!
A WORLD WHERE
THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO VACUUM.
YOU'RE BEST
STAYING AWAY FROM
THAT STRANGE PLACE.
THIS IS WHERE
I TRIED TO
CAPTURE YOU!
WHAT A TERRIBLE
MEMORY!
...
SNOW WRESTLING IS
WHEN SHE SNEAKS UP
ON YOU FROM BEHIND,
THEN TACKLES YOU
AND YELLS
"SNOW-WRESTLING!"
IT'S...
NOT THE BEST
GAME.
WHAT?
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
WATERFALL...
I BARELY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
BUT I'LL DO MY
BEST TO INFORM
YOU!!!
UH, I DON'T HAVE
ANY FACTS ABOUT
THIS ROOM.
BUT I WILL!!
WHAT!?
THERE'S A RUB?
WHERE!?!?
I'LL DO MY
BEST TO FIND
THE RUB.
OOH, WHERE?
AND WHAT'S THIS
HORRIBLE NOOGIE?
MY BROTHER HAS
A STATION HERE.
YES, HE MANS
TWO STATIONS AT
ONCE.
AMAZING, ISN'T
HE?
HE SLACKS OFF
TWICE AS MUCH
AS NORMAL!!
NORMAL FOLKS CAN
ONLY DREAM OF
SUCH SLOTH...
ROCKS?
IT MUST BE ONE
OF UNDYNE'S
INGENIOUS PUZZLES.
YOU'D BETTER BE
CAREFUL!!!
BE WARY OF ROCKS.
WHERE'D YOU GO!?
I CAN'T SEE
YOU!!!
OH WAIT, THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ON THE PHONE.
ARE YOU STILL
ON THE PHONE?
WOWIE, I HAD AN
AWKWARD TIME IN
THIS ROOM EARLIER.
GOOD HEAVENS
YOU WEREN'T AROUND
TO SEE IT!!
YOU REALLY
DIDN'T SEE IT!
I LOVE THAT
FACT, AND
REPEATING IT!
A BRIDGE GROWS
IF YOU ALIGN
FOUR BRIDGE SEEDS.
BUT THAT'S SORT
OF LIMITED IN
USEFULNESS.
WHY DON'T WE
HAVE AIRPLANE
SEEDS???
OR, PHONES THAT
CAN TURN INTO
JETPACKS???
HMMM... THIS PUZZLE...
I'VE GOT IT!!!
TRY TO BUILD A
BRIDGE WITH THE
BRIDGE SEEDS!!
I'M HELPING.
WHAT'S BETTER
THAN A BENCHFUL
OF QUICHE?
THE WISHING ROOM.
DO YOU HAVE
A WISH...?
NYEH HEH HEH!!
I HAVE ONE!!!
I WISH I WAS
TALKING TO MY
COOL FRIEND!!!
LOOK!!!
IT'S COMING TRUE!
WHAT WILL YOU
WISH FOR?
I WISH I HAD
EIGHT LEGS...
SO I COULD WEAR
FOUR PAIRS OF
HOTPANTS.
THERE ARE MANY
ANCIENT PLAQUES
HERE.
WATERFALL IS
PRACTICALLY A
HISTORY MUSEUM.
EXCEPT WITH
MUSCULAR
SEAHORSES.
HI?
ANOTHER HARMLESS
AND VERY SAFE
CORRIDOR...
ALL THANKS TO
ME!!!
NYEH HEH HEH!!
HEH!!!!!
WATCH YOUR STEP!
UNDYNE REALLY CARES
ABOUT THIS GRASS
FOR SOME REASON.
ARE YOU WATCHING?
WHY ARE THERE SO
MANY TABLES LYING
AROUND HERE?
HUH? SANS ISN'T
PLAYING WITH HIS
TELESCOPE?
WOWIE!!! MAYBE HE
WENT TO WORK!!!
WOW!!! AM I
ALLOWED TO BE
PROUD???
HUH? MY BROTHER?
OF COURSE HE HAS
A TELESCOPE.
SANS LOVES
OUTER SPACEY
SCI-FI STUFF.
HMM?
HE NEVER TOLD
YOU??
YEAH, SANS NEVER
TELLS ANYBODY
ANYTHING!
THANKS FOR CALLING.
ICE CREAM?
THANKS, BUT I
LIVE IN SNOWDIN!
THERE'S ICE CREAM
ALL OVER THE
GROUND!!!
SANS!!! I DIDN'T
ASK YOUR OPINION!!
I'M FLATTERED HOW
MUCH YOU WANT TO
GIVE ME ICE CREAM.
NO YOU AREN'T!!
SOMETIMES, PRIZES
ARE HIDDEN UNDER
THE GRASS.
TREASURES LIKE
MUD, OR DIRT.
DID YOU FIND
THE TREASURE?
A BIRD MONSTER??
TRY TALKING TO
IT!!!
OR YOU COULD
PUT ME ON THE
LINE!
I'VE GOT SOME
PRETTY GOOD
TWEETS.
(HORRIBLE
  BIRD IMITATIONS)
DID THE BIRD LIKE
MY TWEETS???
ONION?
HUM HUM HUM...
I'VE HEARD A SHY
MONSTER LIVES
AROUND HERE.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO GET SOMEONE
TO OPEN UP...
YOU SHOULD ENGAGE
THEM IN COMBAT!!!
HUH!?
ARE YOU SERENADING
ME!?
OH NO!!!
YOU'RE MAKING ME
BLUSH!!!
LET'S WRITE A
MUSICAL ABOUT
OUR ADVENTURES!!!
HMMM...
THERE'S SOMETHING
ANNOYING ABOUT
THIS ROOM.
BUT I CAN'T
QUITE PLACE MY
FINGER ON IT...
THEN PLACE MY
WHOLE HAND ON
IT...
THEN PET IT
AFFECTIONATELY...
A MYSTERIOUS
STATUE...
WHAT'S THAT MUSIC?
AM I ON HOLD???
ALWAYS CARRY AN
UMBRELLA IN CASE
IT RAINS!
YOU KNOW.
JUST KEEP A FEW
IN YOUR POCKETS.
NOTHING LIKE A
HOT BUCKET OF
'BRELLAS...
YOU CAN SEE YOUR
REFLECTION IN A
PUDDLE, BUT...
DON'T LET A BODY
OF WATER DETERMINE
YOUR SELF-WORTH!!!
HMMM? YOU'RE
HANGING OUT
WITH A FRIEND?
THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T TALK
TO ME...
YOU'LL MAKE THEM
JEALOUS!
CALLING AGAIN...?
WHERE ARE YOU?
I HEAR WATER.
ARE YOU IN THE
TOILET?
ALSO, WHAT'S A
TOILET?
THAT'S THE KING'S
CASTLE...
SEEMS YOU CAN
FINALLY SEE THE
END.
SEEMS LIKE THE
PHONE CONNECTION'S
GETTING WEAK...
BETTER NOT GO
PAST THAT POINT.
FLOWERS...?
DO ANY OF THEM
TALK!?
SAY HI FOR ME!!!
FLOWERS ARE OUR
BEST FRIENDS!!
GARBAGE, HUH?
BOY, DO I KNOW
GARBAGE!!
AFTER ALL, I'M
HOUSEMATES WITH A
LAZY BAG OF TRASH!
HIS NAME'S TRASHY.
HE LIVES IN THE
GARBAGE CAN.
YOU DIDN'T THINK I
DIDN'T NAME MY
GARBAGE, DID YOU?
I KNOW WHY YOU
CALLED ME.
I ALWAYS MAKE
PEOPLE FEEL
BETTER...
WHEN THEY'RE DOWN
IN THE DUMPS!!!
...
I'VE SPENT TOO
LONG WITH MY
BROTHER TODAY.
FORGET I SAID
THAT.
HEY!
YOU'RE NEAR
UNDYNE'S HOUSE!
THAT'S TO THE
LEFT-UPWARDS.
LUPWARDS.
ALL THE OTHER
DIRECTIONS GO TO
THE WRONG HOUSE.
NORTH:
GHOST HOUSE.
EAST: TURTLE HOUSE.
SOUTH:
TRASH HOUSE.
WEST: BIRD HOUSE.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
NEAR UNDYNE'S
HOUSE.
HEY!
WE SHOULD GO
VISIT UNDYNE!
I LOVE WHEN A PLAN
COMES TOGETHER!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
REALLY???
CAN WE???
THAT'S UNDYNE'S
HOUSE.
LET'S GO THERE
AND HANG OUT
SOME DAY!!!
STILL WAITING
OUTSIDE HER
HOUSE...?
YEAH, I DO THAT
SOMETIMES, TOO!
YOU KNOW, THE
ONE WITH THE
SKELETON IN FRONT.
IT'S A GREAT
PLACE TO...
UHHH?
HI UNDYNE!
HOW'D YOU GET
HERE SO FAST?
WOWIE!!!
UNDYNE!!!
SOMEDAY I WANT
TO BE AS STRONG
AND SWEATY AS YOU.
SO YOU RAN HERE
JUST TO BE ON
THE PHONE???
THEN YOU MUST
HAVE SOMETHING...
EXTREMELY COOL
TO SAY ABOUT
YOUR HOUSE!!!
OH, THAT'S THE
HOUSE OF... UM...
UNDYNE'S NEIGHBOR.
WHAT WAS THEIR
NAME AGAIN?
SPOOKY BLOO BLOO?
NAPPER HOG...?
SO YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH A GHOST...
ISN'T THAT KIND
OF SPOOKY?
I'D THINK YOU'D
LIKE YOUR FRIENDS
WARM AND CUDDLY...
LIKE SKELETONS!!!
VERY SOFT, AND
FULL OF CALCIUM.
THAT HOUSE USED
TO BE HAUNTED.
BECAUSE A GHOST
LIVED THERE.
BUT THE GHOST
MOVED AWAY.
IT'S AN
UN-HAUNTED HOUSE.
BY THE BY,
BREAKING INTO
A HOUSE...
THAT'S ILLEGAL,
RIGHT???
PLEASE STOP
COMMITTING GHOST
CRIMES.
HAPPSTABLOOK,
THE HAPPY
GHOST.
IT'S NOT WRONG.
IT'S JUST MY
HEADCANON.
THESE SNAILS ARE
JUST LIKE MY
BROTHER.
ROUND, SLOW...
AND CONSTANTLY
EMITTING SLIME???
EMITTING SLIME...
THAT'S JUST WHAT
BROTHERS DO.
IF YOU SEE A
SHOP, YOU SHOULD
STOP...
DROP, AND
ROLL...
INTO SOME
GREAT DEALS!!
BECAUSE WE'RE
HAVING A FIRE
SALE!!
AT MY IMAGINARY
STORE, WHICH
SELLS FLAMES.
YET ANOTHER DREAM
OF MINE.
IS THE RIVER
PERSON THERE
TODAY?
ARE THEY?
WHAT'S THAT
STRANGE WHISPER?
I MIGHT HAVE
TO HANG UP.
PAPYRUS ISN'T
HOME RIGHT NOW!!
WHAT?
MUSHROOMS?
CAN YOU EAT THEM?
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN'T EAT
THEM???
I'D TRY EATING
THEM.
LANTERNS?
UM, OKAY...
CAN YOU EAT
THEM???
I'M SERIOUSLY OUT
OF IDEAS HERE.
HMMM...
A CORRIDOR FILLED
WITH WATER.
THAT'S JUST A
GUESS.
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY.
UNDYNE???
OH.
I WAS JUST GOING
TO ASK.
DO YOU WANT TO
PRACTICE MONOLOGUES
TOGETHER...?!!
ATTENTION EVERYONE!
I AM GOING TO
OPEN THE FRIDGE!
ECHO FLOWERS...
THERE'S ONLY ONE
TALKING FLOWER
FOR ME!!
EACH AREA HAS TO
HAVE A PRECARIOUS
BRIDGE.
IT'S MANDATED BY
THE GOVERNMENT.
OF COURSE, KING
FLUFFYBOY WANTS TO
UNMANDATE IT SAFER.
WHY!!? WON'T HE
THINK OF THE
CHILDREN!?
SPIKES. DANGER
BRIDGES. THE
PILLARS OF YOUTH.
THIS IS WHERE
ELDER PUZZLER
LIKES TO STAND.
BLOCK-PUSHING.
KEY-GATHERING.
TEDIOUS AGONY.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
RESPECT OUR ROOTS!
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
RESPECT OUR
PUZZLING ROOTS.
BUT UNDYNE, DON'T
YOU LIKE TRADITION?
WHAT!? YOU THREW
AWAY MY DREAM
LIFE!!!
THE LIFE OF A
SIMPLE SALARYMAN...
COMMUTING EVERY
DAY ON A TRAIN
FULL OF SPIKES...
UNDYNE, DID YOU
REALLY HAVE AN
OFFICE JOB?
THAT'S UNDYNE!!
ALWAYS HELPING OUT
THE COMMUNITY!
THAT'S UNDYNE'S
DRAMATIC CRAG.
SHE'S ALWAYS
POSING ATOP IT.
MUMBLING SOMETHING
TO HERSELF...
I THINK IT'S
SOMETHING SHE
HAS TO MEMORIZE.
NOW I WANT A
SCRAPBOOK OF
MY FIGHT TOO!!!
ONE WEEK LATER,
SAMPLE GLOSSIES
IN THE MAIL.
HEY... ISN'T THIS
WHERE I CALLED
YOU?
I HAVE A PHOTO-
GRAPHIC MEMORY
FOR PHONE CALLS.
HEY, WHEN ARE
WE GONNA HANG
WITH UNDYNE?
HEY, WHEN ARE
WE GONNA HANG
WITH UNDYNE?
OH!
THAT WAS ME!
I WAS JUST
SAYING WE SHOULD
ALL HANG OUT.
WELL!!
NOBODY STARTS AS
GREAT FRIENDS!
THAT'S THE RULE.
N... NO!!!
NOT THE FLATTERY
SUPLEX!!!
OH!!!
YOU'RE IN HOTLAND
NOW!!!
... HEY SANS,
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE?
PHEW!
FINALLY, SANS IS
DOING HIS JOB.
HE'S GOTTEN REALLY
OUT OF SHAPE.
HE TIRES EASILY.
LATELY HE'S BEEN
NAPPING OVER 7
HOURS A NIGHT...
HE'S NAPPING
HIMSELF INTO AN
EARLY GRAVE!!
UNDYNE!! NO!!!
NOT YOU TOO!!!
I'M USUALLY TOO
BUSY TO SLEEP.
WHY???
A WATER COOLER...?
IN HOTLAND???
THAT'S WEIRD.
SHOULDN'T IT BE
A FIRE COOLER
INSTEAD?
WHAT'S A WATER
COOLER DO,
ANYWAY?
MAKE WATER...
COOLER?
SO IT GIVES IT
SPIKES AND MAKES
IT GLOW?
A LAB???
MY BROTHER
WOULD LOVE THAT!
HE LOVES SCIENCE
FICTION!!
ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT'S
REAL.
WAIT, THAT BAG OF
DOG FOOD LOOKS
FAMILIAR...
I REMEMBER SEEING
IT...
IN SANS'S ROOM?
YEAH! I ASKED HIM
WHY HE HAD IT!
HE TOLD ME HE
WAS TRYING TO
EAT HEALTHIER.
YOU'RE IN HER
ROOM, UNINVITED?
WOWIE...
THAT'S EXTREMELY
CREEPY.
MAYBE DON'T DO
THAT.
HOTLAND, HUH...
I KNOW IT LIKE
THE BACK OF
MY HAND...
WHICH, SINCE I'M
ALWAYS WEARING
GLOVES...
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT!!!
MY KNOWLEDGE
QUANTITY IS
STAGNANT.
NEITHER OF US
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HOTLAND.
ZERO PLUS ZERO
IS STILL ZERO.
HEY, YOU SHOULD
COME TO SNOWDIN
AND VISIT ME!
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON A FEW THINGS.
A FEW SENTENCES
TO STAND AROUND
AND REPEAT.
A FEW SENTENCES
TO STAND AROUND
AND REPEAT.
WHAT???
WE'RE IN THE
SAME LOCATION!!
CONVEYOR BELTS
EVERYWHERE??
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
IMAGINE RIDING
ONE TO GET TO
WORK OR SCHOOL.
RIDICULOUS.
NOW ICE AND
SPIKES, THERE'S
CONVENIENCE!!!
GLAD I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND.
DID YOU HURL??
STOP CALLING AND
MAKING HER SAY
GROSS THINGS.
STEAM VENTS?
WOW... THAT
SOUNDS AWFUL.
WHAT IF YOU'RE
WEARING A
DRESS?
GLAD I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND!!
ORANGE AND BLUE
LASERS, HUH?
JUST KEEP IN
MIND WHAT THE
COLORS MEAN.
BLUE MEANS
JUMP...
AND ORANGE MEANS
YOU'LL... SMELL
LIKE ORANGES.
THAT'S WHAT I
REMEMBER.
HAVE FUN!!
ZOINKS!!!
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST AN EXCUSE
TO TALK TO HER.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS WEATHER
DOWN HERE!!!
WOWIE!!!
WILL I NEED
AN UMBRELLA?
IT'S OKAY, I
FORGIVE YOU!
(PSST, WHEN WAS
SHE MAD AT ME?)
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
STAY IN SCHOOL.
A REAL TEACHER...
WOULD NEVER ACCEPT
DEADLY LASERS AS
AN EXCUSE!!
GLAD!
I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND!!
OH NO!
THE PUZZLES
REACTIVATING...
CAUSED THOSE
PEOPLE TO MISS
THEIR WORK!?
OH MY GOD!!!
SANS, GO DO YOUR
JOB(S)!!!
GLAD,
I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND.
THEN WHY ARE
YOU SKIPPING
WORK!?!
I HEARD YOU GOT
TO MEET METTATON!!
IS THAT TRUE!?
CAN YOU GET ME
AN AUTOGRAPH!?
HE'S MY FAVORITE
SEXY RECTANGLE!!
I WISH I LIVED
IN HOTLAND!!!
WH-WHAT?
BUT HE'S SO
POPULAR...
WELL, YOU CAN
SAY THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE POPULAR.
YOU'RE POPULAR
WITH ME!!!
AWW, WOWIE!!
WAIT...
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME...?
WHAT? MY BROTHER'S
ACTUALLY AT HIS
STATION?
BUT SOMEHOW, HE'S
SELLING HOTDOGS
INSTEAD?
SLACKING OFF BY
DOING WORK...
TRULY MY BROTHER
IS A MASTER.
NO FURTHER
COMMENT.
NO, HE HAS...
AT LEAST FOUR?
MY BROTHER ISN'T
EVEN THERE???
WASN'T HE SLACKING
OFF BY SELLING
HOTDOGS?
NOW HE'S SLACKING
OFF FROM SLACKING
OFF...
WHAT? YOU HAVE TO
SOLVE A PUZZLE
ON THE CONVEYORS?
THAT GOES AGAINST
PUZZLE DESIGN
101...
CONVEYORS ARE
AWFUL AND SHOULD
NEVER BE USED!!!
GLAD I DON'T
LIVE ON CONVEYOR
PLANET!!!
WHAT... IS IT?
I HATE THIS.
I'M GONNA HANG
UP NOW!!!
SO THE ARROWS
FLIP WHEN YOU
DO WHAT?
I CAN'T VISUALIZE
THIS PUZZLE AT
ALL.
CAN YOU DRAW
A PICTURE???
THEN HOLD IT UP
TO THE RECEIVER??
DID YOU DRAW IT
YET?
WHAT? HOW'S THIS
PUZZLE WORK?
UMMM...
WHOOPS, I THINK
IT'S UNDYNE'S TURN
TO TALK!!!
WELL, ALPHYS MADE
THE PUZZLE,
RIGHT?
YOU SHOULD JUST
CALL HER UP...
AND SAY IN A
HOT VOICE...
ALPHYS...
I NEED HELP WITH
A...
(AUDIBLE WINK)
PUZZLE...
FINE!!!
GIVE ME HER
NUMBER!!!
I'LL DO THE HOT
VOICE!!!
(AUDIBLE WINK)...
WAIT, WHOSE NUMBER
IS THIS???
THE ROYAL GUARD
PATROLS THAT
AREA.
YES, LIKE SNOWDIN,
HOTLAND HAS ROYAL
GUARD MEMBERS.
WATERFALL DOESN'T
NEED THEM BECAUSE
IT'S GOT UNDYNE!!!
DID YOU SEE
THEM?
I LOVE THE NEWS!
IT'S SO
INFORMATIVE...
AND FULL OF CUT-
THROAT, EXPLOSIVE
ACTION!!!
KA-WOWIE!
THE CORE...
YOU'RE GETTING
CLOSE, HUH...?
IT MIGHT SOUND
WEIRD THAT SPIDERS
NEED DONATIONS.
BUT THINK ABOUT
IT, THEY HAVE
EIGHT FEET.
THAT'S FOUR PAIRS
OF SHOES.
A SPIDER WEARING
FOUR PAIRS OF
PINK BOOTIES.
MEDITATE ON
THIS IMAGE.
OM...
THE ENTIRE ROOM
IS COVERED IN
STEAM THINGIES?
OH MY GOD, CAN'T
YOU JUST TAKE
A BUS!?!?
HOTLAND STINKS...
DON'T TELL ME
MORE OF THIS
GARBAGE.
A WHOLE ROOM
COVERED IN VENTS?
OH NO...
OH MY GOD!!!
I HATE THIS!?!?
ITS BEST IF YOU
DON'T ENCOURAGE
HER.
LASERS ON
CONVEYORS?
NO THANKS.
SOUNDS LIKE MY
LEAST FAVORITE
NIGHTMARE.
LASERS ON
CONVEYORS? ARE
YOU SERIOUS???
OH MY GOD???
NO???
WHY????
I THOUGHT YOU
HATED MAKING
UP PUZZLES!!
PLEASE STOP
ENCOURAGING
HER.
WHERE DID THAT
TABLE COME FROM?
DOES IT BELONG
TO THE MOUSE??
EH???
MAYBE THEY BELONG
TO THE MOUSE.
TO PUT THE
CHEESE ON.
OH MY GOD!!!
GET OUT OF
HERE!!!
WAIT, DOES IT
COME FROM MILK??
WOW!!!
THAT CHOREOGRAPHY!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M FRIENDS...
WITH A BONE-A-
FIDE OPERA
STAR!!!
WOWIE!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT TO DANCE
WITH METTATON!
IS DEATH COOL?
I WANT TO MEET
DEATH...
WHAT?
I? SCREAM?
SURE!
I'LL TRY.
A. A. A. A. A.
I'M SCREAMING VERY
SLOWLY.
A.
I ALMOST CAPTURED
YOU...
WHERE'S MY ICE
CREAM.
A HOT-L...
THAT'S SHORT FOR
HOTLAND, RIGHT?
REALLY??
ME NEITHER.
YEAH!!
LET'S VACATION TO
A HOTEL!!!
OH, I WAS BEING
SARCASTIC.
I WOULD NEVER
TAKE A VACATION
FOR ANY REASON.
A FANCY
SCHMANCY
RESTAURANT!?!?
AFTER TASTING MY
COOKING, THAT SEEMS
POINTLESS, RIGHT?
I BET THEY CAN'T
EVEN MAKE
SPAGHETTI!
PSHHHHHHT.
WHO NEEDS THAT!
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
GREAT CHEFS!
ISN'T FRIENDSHIP
DELICIOUS?
CAREFUL.
LOTS OF HOTELS ARE
INFESTED NOWADAYS.
THEY CAN SLIDE
UNDER CLOSED DOOR
HOLES 1 INCH HIGH.
WHAT DO I MEAN?
YOU'LL KNOW IT
IF YOU SEE IT.
WHAT WAS THAT???
CAREFUL. I'VE HEARD
THAT HOTEL HAS A
DOG PROBLEM.
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT PETS.
THE PROBLEM IS...
DOG.
NOT ALL DOGS.
JUST THAT ONE.
EVERYTHING.
THE FLOWER IS MY
FRIEND!
OH MY GOD!!
HE'S NOT IMAGINARY!
HE HAS A NAME!
FL...
FLOWERY?
OK, I DID!!
BUT HE'S REAL!!
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
HOTEL ROOM!?
... WHY?
MY GARAGE IS
ALWAYS OPEN TO
YOU!!
THE PRICE IS
RIGHT!!
PARTY "GAMES"?
LIKE THE SIX-
LEGGED RACE?
H-HEY!!!
NO PILLOWS FROM
THE COUCH!
HEY!!!
NO ENTIRE COUCH!!
HEY, YOU DIDN'T
HIT ME WITH MY
ENTIRE COUCH.
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
LINGUINE?
LINGUINE.
THE FLAT PASTA.
IT CAN ALSO BE
USED TO TIE UP
PRESENTS.
THE FLATNESS
MAKES A NICE
RIBBON.
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
IS ELEVATOR
REALLY SPELLED
THAT WAY?
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
RAVIOLI?
RAVIOLI...
THE DUMPLING-TYPE
PASTA.
THE TREASURE CHEST
OF THE CULINARY
WORLD.
YOU CAN PUT GEMS
OR GOLD INSIDE.
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
I GUESS THAT
MAKES SENSE!
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R2.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
RIGATONI?
THE TUBE-SHAPED
PASTA.
IN A PINCH, IT
CAN BE USED AS
A STRAW.
IF YOU NEED TO
DRINK A CUP OF
SAUCE.
WAIT, UNDYNE.
IF THE R STANDS
FOR RED...
WHAT COLOR DOES
THE L STAND FOR?
OH! OF COURSE!
WAIT.
ISN'T THAT TWO
WORDS?
THREE DOESN'T
FIX THE ISSUE!
AREN'T YOU WORKING
IN THE VERY NEXT
ROOM!?
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L2.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
LASAGNA?
I HOPE NOT.
I DON'T MAKE
LASAGNA ANYMORE.
THAT GLUTTONOUS
DOG ALWAYS EATS
IT FIRST!
FIRST MY BONES,
AND NOW THIS...
THEN IT RETREATS
INTO A SHALLOW
BLUE BOX.
COVERS ITSELF
WITH A BLANKET,
AND SLEEPS...
REALLY!?
I HATE LIMES.
WELL, ONE TIME I
WAS GIVING MYSELF
THE SPA TREATMENT.
I PUT THE LIME
SLICES IN MY
EYES, LIKE ON TV.
BUT IT STINGS!!
HOW DO THEY DO
IT!?
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE
REJUVENATING.
BUT IT WASN'T
WORKING!
SO I JUST STUCK
MORE LIMES INTO
MY EYES.
I JUST WANT TO
HAVE HANDSOME,
BISHONEN EYES.
LIKE METTATON...
SIGH...
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L3.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
LUMACONI?
THAT'S THE SNAIL-
SHAPED PASTA!
SANS BOUGHT SOME
RECENTLY.
HE'LL PROBABLY
FILL THEM WITH
HOTDOGS AND SLIME.
HEY!!
MAYBE HE'LL SHARE
SOME WITH YOU!
MAYBE WE NEED TO
THINK MORE
ABSTRACTLY.
MAYBE THE L
STANDS FOR...
LOVE.
BUT UNDYNE, DON'T
YOU TURN PEOPLE'S
HEARTS GREEN?
WELL, IT WOULD BE
AN AFFECTIONATE
NAUSEA.
IT'S DECIDED!!
L STANDS FOR!!
A HEART THAT
UNDYNE HAS MADE
NAUSEOUS?
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R3.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
ROTINI?
THE SCREW-SHAPED
PASTA.
I USED IT TO HOLD
MY SENTRY STATION
TOGETHER.
MY WHOLE STATION
IS MADE OUT OF
CARDBOARDHYDRATES!
WAIT.
WHAT IF R AND L.
STAND FOR RIGHT
AND LEFT???
BUT IF YOU FACE
THE OTHER WAY...
HOW CAN YOU KNOW
THEY ARE REALLY
STILL WRONG?
PAPYRUS?
WHO IS THAT?
THIS IS...
COOLSKELETON95.
SORRY. CAN'T TALK.
I'M BUSY BEING
POPULAR ON-LINE.
NYEH HEH HEH!
ONLY KIDDING!
YOU HAVE BEEN HAD!
IT WAS PAPYRUS
PLAYING A SIMPLE
GENTLEMAN'S RUSE!
WINK!
YOU CAN SEE
ME WINKING,
RIGHT.
PAPYRUS?
EXCUSE ME?
I AM THE VERY
COOL ONLINE GUY,
COOLSKELETON95.
(UNDYNE!!!)
(SHHH!!!)
(YOU'RE GOING TO
REVEAL MY SECRET
ONLINE PERSONA!)
WHAT!?
REALLY!?
OH NO!!!
STRONGFISH!!
PLEASE BRING BACK
MY FRIEND UNDYNE!
AN APRON LYING
IN HOTLAND?
THAT MAKES SENSE.
COOKING IS
DEFINITELY
FIRE-ELEMENTAL.
UNLESS YOU COOK
A POPSICLE.
UNLESS YOU COOK
A POPSICLE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU
CALLED IT LAST
TIME WE, UH...
WOW! I SAW IT!
THE MULTICOLOR
TILE PUZZLE!
YOU DID IT!!
MY DIRECTIONS
HELPED YOU!!
I'M A GOOD
EXPLAINER!
NYEH HEH HEH!
SEEMS LIKE YOU
WEREN'T ABLE TO
COMPLETE IT.
YOU'VE GOT TO
BE PREPARED NEXT
TIME!
I'LL HAVE TO
EXPLAIN IT ALL
AGAIN!
YOU SEE, RED
TILES ARE
IMPASSIBLE.
PINK TILES
DON'T DO
ANYTHING.
GREEN TILES
ARE...
PLAID TILES
ARE...
HEADING INTO
THE CORE...?
HMMM.
YOU MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO
CALL PAST THERE.
I KNOW!
IT SOUNDS AWFUL!
HOW WILL YOU
GET BY WITHOUT
ME?
WELL, I HAVE
CONFIDENCE YOU
WILL FIND A WAY!
I WILL TALK TO
YOU AGAIN, SO
DO NOT WORRY!
GOOD LUCK OUT
THERE!
QUIT IT!
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY GOODBYE!
OH NO!
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WITHOUT US...?
YEAH! YOU CAN'T
GET RID OF US!
A POSTER FOR
METTATON'S SHOW?
THAT'S NEATO.
I WANT A POSTER
FOR MY PUZZLES!
AND MAYBE A FEW
OPENING BANDS.
THEY COULD PLAY
MY THEME SONG!
I JUST NEED TO
GET A THEME SONG.
A REAL EVENT!
WE COULD HAVE A
LIVE BAND!
AND FIREWORKS!
WON'T YOU JUST
EAT BBQ INSTEAD
OF FIGHTING?
AND BONES AS
KABONE SKEWERS!
LIKE A KABOB BUT
WITH ONLY BONES.
DO SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FEET?
WAIT.
SPIDERS DON'T HAVE
FEET.
DO SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FINGERS?
JUST CURIOUS.
HEY, UNDYNE.
DO SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FEET?
DUCKS CAN SPIN
WEBS!?
BREAD HAS GUTS?
WOW!!
YOU'RE REALLY
SMART, UNDYNE!
OF COURSE!
EVERYONE KNOWS
SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FEET.
I'VE HEARD THERE
ARE TWO GROUPS
OF SPIDERS.
ONE IN HOTLAND,
AND ONE IN THE
RUINS.
SINCE THE SPIDERS
CAN'T CROSS THE
COLD OF SNOWDIN.
THEY NEED SOME
KIND OF TRANSPORT.
LIKE A TANDEM
MOTORCYCLE WITH
EIGHT WHEELS.
OR A UNICYCLE
WITH EIGHT
WHEELS!
I WONDER IF ANY
OF MY ONLINE
FANS ARE SPIDERS.
SANS!
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT SOMETHING.
FANGS FOR VISITING
MY WEB-SITE.
THAT'S WHAT SPIDERS
LIKE TO POST.
HMMM...
A MYSTERIOUS
SCIENCE HOUSE.
LAB?
LABRADOR... Y?
DOES THAT MEAN
THERE ARE DOGS
INSIDE?
STRANGE DOG'S
HOUSE...
ANIME?
ISN'T THAT A KIND
OF CARTOON FOR
SMALL CHILDREN?
IS (THE SOUND A
BABY MAKES) AN
EMOTION?
WAIT...
UNDYNE, DO YOU
LIKE ANIME?
UH OH!!!
I MEAN, I'VE
NEVER SEEN ANY.
MAYBE I ACTUALLY
DO LIKE ANIME!
MAYBE I'M A BABY
WHO LOVES CARTOONS
FOR CHILDREN!
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO
SAY.
SANS!!!
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO???
WHAT!?
NOBODY!?
CAN I TALK TO
THEM TOO???
WAIT A SECOND...
I RECOGNIZE THIS
NUMBER!!!
ATTENTION, HUMAN!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS...
AM NOW CAPTAIN OF
THE ROYAL GUARD!
IT'S EVERYTHING I'VE
EVER DREAMED OF...
EXCEPT, INSTEAD
OF FIGHTING, WE
JUST WATER FLOWERS.
SO THAT'S EVER-
SO-SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT.
AND, WE'RE HELPING
DR. ALPHYS
WITH HER RESEARCH!
SHE'S GONNA FIND A
WAY TO GET US OUT
OF HERE.
UNDYNE IS HELPING
HER TOO!
THOUGH, TO BE
HONEST, HER METHOD
OF HELPING...
SEEMS KIND OF...
EXPLOSION-INDUCING.
BUT I THINK ALPHYS
LIKES HAVING HER
AROUND.
UH OH!!!
HEY!!! HUMAN!!!
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M DOING FINE!!!
WELL, BESIDES ONE
THING...
THE QUEEN
DISBANDED THE
ROYAL GUARD.
SINCE WE DON'T
HAVE TO FIGHT
HUMANS ANYMORE.
WOW!!!
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO
WITH MY LIFE.
BUT, THAT'S
OKAY!
BECAUSE I'M
STILL WORKING
HARD!
EVEN IF IT'S
ON NOTHING AT
ALL!
SO DON'T FEEL
BAD!
PAPYRUS IS FINE!
UNDYNE IS THE
ONE THAT'S GOT
IT BAD!
SHE LOST HER
JOB...
THEN SHE LOST
HER HOUSE...
IT WAS SAD...
BUT WE'RE TAKING
CARE OF HER!
SHE LIVES ON
OUR COUCH NOW.
IT'S LIKE A
SLEEPOVER EVERY
NIGHT!
A SLEEPOVER
THERE'S NO
ESCAPE FROM.
OH, WE GAVE HER
A JOB, TOO.
SANS HIRED HER AT
HIS ILLEGAL HOT
DOG STAND.
SHE HATES WORKING
THERE!
BUT SHE MAKES
A MEAN HOT DOG.
OH YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT THIS,
BUT...
SHE, UM, REALLY
HATES YOU NOW.
EVEN MORE THAN
SHE EVER HAS.
IT'S BECAUSE SHE
MADE FRIENDS WITH
YOU, THEN...
SHE SAID YOU
KILLED SOMEONE?
I KNOW, THAT
SOUNDS RIDICULOUS
DOESN'T IT?
BUT SHE FEELS SO
HURT AND BETRAYED.
AND ANGRY AT
HERSELF, TOO.
SHE SAYS...
SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY...
SHE EVER LET
HERSELF BECOME
FRIENDS WITH YOU.
THAT SHE KNEW
WHAT HUMANS WERE
LIKE...
AND YET SHE
STILL FAILED TO
RESIST.
MORE PEOPLE GOT
HURT BECAUSE OF
HER MISTAKE.
I REALLY CAN'T
UNDERSTATE.
HOW MUCH SHE
HATES YOU.
IT PAINS ME TO
SAY THIS, BUT...
YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY NEVER
COME BACK HERE.
IF YOU DO, UNDYNE
WILL DEFINITELY
DESTROY YOU.
NOT EVEN THE QUEEN
CAN STOP HER.
SO, UH...
GOODBYE FOREVER.
I'LL MISS YOU,
MY FRIEND.
AND YOU MADE
ASGORE DISAPPEAR?
AND MADE ALPHYS
DISAPPEAR, TOO.
SHE'S NOT VERY
HAPPY.
SHE SAYS THINGS
LIKE...
I COULDN'T PROTECT
HER...
IT'S HARD TO GET
HER TO DO ANYTHING
NOW.
I EVEN SUGGESTED
WE TRY TO GET
REVENGE ON YOU.
YOU KNOW, SO I
COULD SEE YOU
AGAIN.
BUT SHE JUST
LOOKED AT ME AND
SAID...
REVENGE WON'T BRING
ANYBODY BACK.
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU DID,
BUT...
CAN YOU PLEASE
BRING BACK HER
FRIENDS?
IF YOU MADE THEM
DISAPPEAR?
PLEASE...
UNDYNE'S NOT
DOING VERY WELL.
BYE.
SHE STILL BLAMES
YOU...
FOR THE
DISAPPEARANCE
OF ASGORE.
SHE TALKS TO ME
A LOT...
ABOUT GETTING
REVENGE ON YOU.
SHE HAS A
LUDICROUS PLAN...
TO CROSS THE
BARRIER AND
BEAT YOU UP.
TO BE HONEST,
I THINK IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT I'D LIKE TO
BELIEVE IT'S
NOT!!!
CAUSE I WANT TO
GO WITH HER!
THEN I'D GET TO
SEE YOU AGAIN!
EVEN IF I'D HAVE
TO FIGHT YOU.
WELL, KEEP YOUR
FINGERS CROSSED!
AND KEEP IN
TOUCH...
IT'LL MAKE OUR
PLANS EASIER.
BYE!
AND ALPHYS'
DISAPPEARANCE, TOO.
SHE'S NOT VERY
HAPPY.
SHE SAYS THINGS
LIKE...
BUT SHE JUST
LOOKED AT ME AND
SAID...
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU DID,
BUT...
PLEASE DON'T NOOGIE
THE PHONE.
ME.
BUT HE'S EXTREMELY
GOOD.
PLEASE DON'T NOOGIE
THE SKELETON.
BUT IF SHE KNEW
WHO WE WERE
TALKING TO...
WE HAVE THE
MERCY TO SPARE
YOU FROM HER!!
BYE BYE FOR NOW!
IF SHE KNEW WHO
WE WERE TALKING
TO...
YEAH!!!
I LOVE STANDING IN
FOR THE QUEEN!!!
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
FOR WHEN A HUMAN
COMES.
I'M GOING TO BE
A GREAT MOM!!!
BY THE WAY,
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?
OH, COOL.
TELL THEM I SAY
HI!!!
HEY, SANS, WHO ARE
YOU TALKING TO?
OH, COOL.
WAIT, DID YOU
SAY THE HUMAN!?
CAN I TALK TO
THEM???
HEY!!!
UNDYNE'S THE
EMPRESS NOW!!
IT'S AMAZING!!!
AND SHE APPOINTED
ME TO BE...
THE MOST IMPORTANT
ROYAL POSITION!!!
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S LITERALLY
THE TITLE.
WHAT DO I DO?
SHE TOLD ME TO,
UM...
STAND AROUND AND
LOOK CUTE.
WELL!!!
THAT'S THE PERFECT
JOB FOR ME!!!
I DO THAT ALL THE
TIME, WITHOUT
TRYING!!
FINALLY!!
I'M IMPORTANT.
AND IT'S ALL
THANKS TO YOU,
AND THE HORRIBLE
THINGS YOU DID.
THANK YOU, HUMAN!
COME BACK AND
VISIT SOMETIME!!
WAIT...
UNDYNE WOULD
PROBABLY KILL YOU.
BUT...
YOU'D GET TO
SEE ME.
SO YOU GOTTA
RISK IT!!!
YOU GOTTA!!!
SEE YOU SOON.
HEY!!!
IT'S ME, PAPYRUS!!
IMAGINE ME WEARING
COOL GLASSES, AND
A SUIT.
AND IMAGINE SANS
WEARING SUNGLASSES
BEING A BOUNCER.
THAT'S OUR LIFE...
IT'S SO COOL!!!
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
WAY BETTER SINCE
YOU CAME HERE!!!
WELL, MINUS THE
FACT THAT
EVERYTHING SUCKS...
FOR ANYONE THAT
DOESNT WORSHIP
METTATON.
AND MINUS THE FACT
THAT MY FRIEND
UNDYNE IS MISSING.
WHO KNOWS WHERE
SHE WENT.
SHE NEVER LIKED
METTATON'S SHOW.
PEOPLE WHO DON'T
TEND TO KIND OF...
DISAPPEAR.
I MISS HER A
LOT SOMETIMES.
IF YOU SEE HER,
CAN YOU TELL HER
I SAID HI?
THANKS!
SEE YOU LATER!
HELLO!!!
HUMAN!!!
IT'S STRANGE.
ASGORE, ALPHYS,
METTATON, AND
UNDYNE WENT AWAY.
SANS SAYS THEY
WENT ON VACATION.
I HOPE THEY'RE
HAVING FUN!!!
OH YEAH.
I'M THE RULER OF
THE UNDERGROUND
NOW!!!
EVERYTHING IS
IMPROVING A LOT
HERE.
PRODUCTIVITY IS UP!
BECAUSE I TELL
EVERYONE TO KEEP
WORKING.
AND, NO ONE GOES
HUNGRY!!!
BECAUSE I COOK
EVERYONE
SPAGHETTI.
MEANWHILE, MY
BROTHER HANDLES
THE PAPERWORK.
STRANGELY...
HE SEEMS TO BE
WORKING HARD?
THIS SOUNDS MESSED
UP... BUT...
I'M PROUD...
OF HIM???
OH NO!!!!
AS FOR OUR HUMAN
POLICY...
WE'VE DECIDED, UM.
SANS, WHAT WAS IT?
RIGHT!
SO IT'S CASE-BY-
CASE!
IF THEY'RE EVIL...
WE GIVE THEM
PUZZLES!
IF THEY'RE GOOD...
WE ALSO GIVE
THEM PUZZLES!
THAT SEEMS TO BE
THE BEST WAY!
IS SANS GONE?
YOU KNOW...
DON'T TELL MY
BROTHER, BUT...
DESPITE THE
IMPROVEMENTS
WE'VE MADE...
SOMETIMES THIS JOB
IS KIND OF HARD.
SINCE THE KING
WENT AWAY...
LOTS OF PEOPLE
JUST WANT TO
GIVE UP.
SOMETIMES, EVEN MY
BEST
ENCOURAGEMENT...
DOESN'T WORK.
AND, AND, I MISS
UNDYNE, TOO.
SHE NEVER ANSWERS
MY PHONE CALLS...
SHE MUST BE
 HAVING A LOT OF
FUN ON VACATION.
I JUST WISH SHE'D
SEND A POSTCARD.
BUT HEY!!!
I WON'T GIVE UP!
I CAN'T GIVE UP!
I HAVE TO MAKE
EVERYONE GIVE UP
GIVING UP!
WE'LL GET OUT
OF HERE, SLOWLY!!!
THEN WE CAN ALL
HANG OUT AGAIN!!!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
HOWDY!
IF IT ISN'T MY
GOOD FRIEND,
WHO TRUSTS ME.
THIS IS PAPYRUS.
YOUR ALSO
MUTUAL FRIEND.
ALPHYS AND I
FINISHED OUR
TRAINING EARLY.
VERY EARLY.
SO I SENT HER
HOME.
VERY HOME.
UH... NOW.
I FEEL STRONGLY
AND FOR NO
APPARENT REASON.
YOU SHOULD ALSO
GO... THERE.
TO HER.
LAB... HOUSE.
I HAVE ONLY
GOOD FEELINGS
ABOUT THIS.
GOODBYE.

* "The power to take their
  SOULs."
* "This is the power that
  the humans feared."
* "The War of Humans and
  Monsters."
* The northern room hides a
  great treasure.
* Hurt, beaten, and fearful for
  our lives, we surrendered
  to the humans.
* Seven of their greatest
  magicians sealed us underground
  with a magic spell.
* Anything can enter through the
  seal, but only beings with a
  powerful SOUL can leave.
* However...
* There is a prophecy.
* The Angel...
* The One Who Has Seen The
  Surface...
* They will return.
* And the underground will go
  empty.
* The humans, afraid of our
  power, declared war on us.
* They attacked suddenly, and
  without mercy.
* Without candles or magic to
  guide them Home, the monsters
  used crystals to navigate.
* Why did the humans attack?
* Indeed, it seemed that they
  had nothing to fear.
* Humans are unbelievably strong.
* It would take the SOUL of
  nearly every monster...
* ... just to equal the power
  of a single human SOUL.
* This power has no counter.
* Indeed, a human cannot
  take a monster's SOUL.
* When a monster dies, its
  SOUL disappears.
* And an incredible power
  would be needed to take the
  SOUL of a living monster.
* There is only one way to
  reverse this spell.
* If a huge power, equivalent
  to seven human SOULs, attacks
  the barrier...
* It will be destroyed.
* In the end, it could
  hardly be called a war.
* United, the humans were too
  powerful, and us monsters,
  too weak.
* Not a single SOUL was taken,
  and countless monsters were
  turned to dust...
* When four Bridge Seeds align
  in the water, they will
  sprout.
* If an error is made, the Bell
  Blossom can call Bridge Seeds
  back to where they started.
* WISHING ROOM
* But humans have one weakness.
* Ironically, it is the strength
  of their SOUL.
* Its power allows it to persist
  outside the human body, even
  after death.
* There is only one exception.
* The SOUL of a special species
  of monster called a
  "Boss Monster."
* A Boss Monster's SOUL is
  strong enough to persist
  after death...
* If only for a few moments.
* A human could absorb this
  SOUL.
* But this has never happened.
* And now it never will.
* But this cursed place has
  no entrances or exits.
* There is no way a human
  could come here.
* We will remain trapped
  down here forever.
* If a monster defeats a human,
  they can take its SOUL.
* A monster with a human SOUL...
* A horrible beast with
  unfathomable power.
* A haunting song echoes
  down the corridor...
* Won't you play along?
* Only the first 8 are fine.
* (It's an illustration of a
  strange creature...)
* (There's something very
  unsettling about this drawing.)
Politics Bear
* This town doesn't have a
  mayor.
* But if there's ever a problem,
  a skeleton will tell a fish
  lady about it.
* Thaaaaaat's politics!
* Politics.
* What if I ran for mayor...?
* I don't think I would do
  a good job, and I hate
  responsibility...
* But I love politics.
* So I might be a perfect
  match.
* I heard Dr. Alphys told
  the king and queen the
  awful things she'd done.
* The king felt so bad
  that he didn't know.
* He gave her a big hug.
* Then the queen fired her.
* Now we don't have a Royal
  Scientist anymore...
* Thaaaaat's politics!
* Too bad there are no
  politics on the surface.
* Hmmm, usually that skeleton
  goes to meet with Undyne
  about now.
* Where is he...?
* I can feel our political
  system crumbling apart...
Punk Hamster
* The capital's getting pretty
  crowded, so I've heard they're
  going to start moving here.
* Hmmm...
* I don't want to see the
  erasure of our local culture.
* But I definitely want to see
  some city slickers slip onto
  their butts!
* Yeah, bring 'em on!
* What will happen to
  Grillby's if everyone
  moves in...?
* We're gonna have to have
  chairs to the ceiling.
* Hey! People won't have to
  move in from the city
  anymore!
* Seems like we won't have
  to lose our local culture.
* ... except we're all moving
  out of here, huh.
* Oh well. Guess it can't be
  all punk-peaches and punk-
  cream.
* ... who knows.
* Maybe we'll have room.

* Haha, ha ha ha.
* Secret, secret.
* I've done up a trouble.
* I set the lava on fire.
* No one will EVER know.
* It's the perfect crime...
* Haha, ha ha ha.
* If we leave, no one will
  REALLY ever know!!
* This crime just gets perfecter
  and perfecter.
* The lava's so spicey now.
* Haha, ha ha ha.
* Ya wanna "hang" out?
* Haha, ha ha ha.
* Sorry, I'm all TIED UP!!!
* Psyche! Owned!
* No one wants to be MY
  friend!!!
* Haha, ha ha ha.
* Wonder if any humans would
  wanna be my friend.
* PSYYYYCHE!
* That'd NEVER happen!
* I'm too spicey to have
  any friends.

  anonymous tip about a human
  wearing a striped shirt.

  right now...

* Sorry... UNDYNE, like, told
  us there was totally a
  human in the area.
* So, like, us Royal Guards are
  blocking off the elevators
  for now.
* Ngah! Even if the elevators
  aren't working anyway, we'll
  do our best, Ms. UNDYNE!
* Like, NO WAY you're getting
  by us.
* But, between you and me...
* I think you could go through
  that creepy lab over there.
* Between you, me, and my
  bro here, I mean.
* I tell him ALL my secrets.
* Hey!
* No loitering!
* Like, just kidding.
* I don't care.
* Like, loiter your heart out.
* Oh, hey.
* We're, like, taking a rain
  check on that killing-you
  thing.
* Like, don't tell Undyne
  about this, OK?
* You didn't tell her, did
  you...?
* Undyne told us that the
  Royal Guard is being disbanded.
* Like, bummer...
* Guess we'll have to get
  used to Love and Peace.
You can

Rabbit Girl
* Isn't my little Cinnamon
  just the cutest?
* Bun-buns are so adorable...
* Tee hee!
* Bun-bun-bun-bun-bun...
* Huh? Yes, I'm taking
  my bunny for a walk.
* It's just a very slow one.
* That kid over there told
  me that it's weird that
  I have a pet bunny.
* First, there'd be nothing
  weird about it.
* It's cute!
* Second...
* What?
* It's normal to walk your
  younger brother on a
  leash, right?
* Ah, it's so peaceful
  and quiet...
* Usually one of those dogs
  chases my little Cinnamon
  around.
* Usually one of those
  skeletons chases my little
  Cinnamon around.
Rabbit Kid
* We're about to visit Snowdin
  for the first time.
* You just came from there,
  right?
* How is it...?
* You should go back to
  Snowdin.
* That lady over there...
* Something about her disturbs
  me.
* I think I've figured it out.
* ... no, nevermind.
* That lady over there's
  been going for a walk
  for a while now.
* ... but she hasn't moved
  an inch from where she's
  standing.
* W-well, I haven't either,
  but I don't want her to
  notice me over here...
* Is anyone else weirded out
  by those giant shambling
  amalgamates, or...?
* ......
* That lady over there
  seems happy today.
* Don't know why, but it's
  sending shivers down my
  spine...
Ragel
* Mushroom dance
* Mushroom dance
* Whatever could it mean
* It symbolizes my inner
  pain.
* It symbolizes my inner
  torment, trapped here
  by my hyphae.
* My struggle to pull away.
* My struggle to escape.
* But alas, to no avail.
* If only I could see the
  world above.
* But even if the barrier
  was open, how would I
  leave...?
* It means you've lived a
  life of sin.
* It means...
* Don't talk to me.
* It symbolizes my unbridled
  happiness.
* The government told me
  they are willing to
  transplant me outside!
* Why didn't you smile at my
  dance? It almost feels
  a little rude...

* Those dogs are part of
  the ROYAL GUARD, the elite
  military group led by UNDYNE.
* She's rude, loud, and beats up
  everybody who gets in her
  way...
* It's no wonder all the kids
  want to be like her when
  they grow up!
* I want to be like UNDYNE
  when I grow up, too!
* Hoo hoo hoo!
* Sans is a sentry.
* But don't let his title make
  you think he does anything.
* Everyone knows he sits
  around in the forest
  reading car magazines.
* Ehhhhhhhhnnnnn...
* I wish I had something else
  to do.
* Those dogs are part of
  the ROYAL GUARD, the...
* Huh?
* Where are they?
* Something feels really off.
* Wow, a brand new world...
* I might not get to
  translate for Grillby
  anymore...
* ... which is fine, since I
  was actually just making
  up what he was saying.
* Grillby is getting nervous.
* Sans is his best customer,
  and he hasn't shown up
  at all today...
* Something feels really bad.
* Our lives are going nowhere,
  aren't they...?
* I think I need another
  espresso...
* Grillbz said that he'd offer
  you a glass of water, but he
  doesn't touch the stuff.
* Grillbz said that your
  food is probably cold
  by now.
River Person
* Tra la la.
* I am the riverman.
* Or am I the riverwoman...?
* It doesn't really matter.
* I love to ride in my boat.
* Would you care to join me?
* Tra la la.
* Care for a ride?
* Then perhaps another time.
* Or perhaps not.
* It doesn't really matter.
* Then we're off...
* Tra la la.
* The waters are wild today.
* That's good luck...
* Tra la la.
* Tra la la.
* The waters are wild today.
* That's bad luck...

* whoops.
* i knew i should have
  used today's crossword
  instead.
* what? really, dude?
* that easy-peasy word
  scramble?
* that's for baby bones.
* i've been thinking
  about selling treats
  too.
  
* you're right.
* i should charge way
  more than than that.
* that's still too low.
* i have to pay for
  the raw materials
  somehow.
* what?
* you don't have the
  money?
* hey, that's okay.
* i don't have any snow.
* wow, that's a lot
  of cash.
* that's why i'm sorry
  to say...
* i can't sell you
  this fried snow.
* it's got too much
  sentimental value.
* don't you know a
  good deal when you
  hear one?
* i'm thinking about
  getting into the
  telescope business.
* it's normally 50000G
  to use this premium
  telescope...
* but...
* since i know you,
  you can use it for free.
* howzabout it?
* huh?
* you aren't satisfied?
* don't worry.
* i'll give you a
  full refund.
* well, come back
  whenever you want.
* what?
* haven't you seen a guy
  with two jobs before?
* fortunately, two jobs
  means twice as many
  legally-required breaks.
* ...
* hey, looks like you're
  really turning yourself
  around.
* how about i treat you
  to lunch at grillby's?
* ... when everyone you
  scared away comes
  back, i mean.
* well, if you insist...
* i'll pry myself away
  from my work...
* OK. have fun.
* whoops, watch where
  you sit down.
* sometimes weirdos put
  whoopee cushions on
  the seats.
* anyway, let's order.
* ok, coming right up.
* hey, that sounds
  pretty good.
* grillby, we'll have
  a double order of
  fries.
* grillby, we'll have
  a double order of
  burg.
* so, what do you
  think...
* of course he's cool.
* you'd be cool too
  if you wore that
  outfit every day.
* he'd only take that
  thing off if he
  absolutely had to.
* oh well.
* at least he washes
  it.
* and by that i mean
  he wears it in
  the shower.
* hey, pal.
* sarcasm isn't funny,
  okay?
* my brother's a real
  star.
* he's the person who
  pushed me to get
  this sentry job.
* maybe it's a little
  strange, but
  sometimes...
* ... it's nice to have
  someone call you out
  on being lazy.
* even though nothing
  could be further
  from the truth.
* here comes the grub.
* bone appetit.
* more for me.
* so you know all
  about it.
* i'll tell you, then.
* the echo flower.
* they're all over the
  marsh.
* say something to them,
  and they'll repeat it
  over and over...
* what about it?
* well, papyrus told
  me something interesting
  the other day.
* sometimes, when no
  one else is around...
* a flower appears and
  whispers things to
  him.
* flattery...
* advice...
* encouragement...
* ... predictions.
* weird, huh?
* someone must be using
  an echo flower to
  play a trick on him.
* keep an eye out, ok?
* thanks.
* oh, by the way...
* i'm flat broke.
* can you foot the
  bill?
* hey buddy, what's up?
* wanna buy a hot dog?
* here.
* have fun.
* here's another hot
  dog.
* it's on the house.
* well, no.
* it's on you.
* sorry, thirty is
  the limit on
  head-dogs.
* i'll be 'frank' with
  you.
* as much as i like
  putting hot dogs
  on your head...
* thirty is just
  an excessive number.
* twenty-nine, now
  that's fine, but
  thirty...
* does it look like
  my arms can reach
  that high?
* thanks, kid.
* here's your hot dog.
* thanks, kid.
* here's your 'dog.
* yeah. 'dog.
* apostrophe-dog.
* it's short for hot-dog.
* another h'dog?
* here you go...
* whoops, i'm actually
  out of hot dogs.
* here, you can have
  a hot cat instead.
* another dog, coming
  right up...
* ... you really like
  hot animals, don't
  you?
* hey, i'm not judging.
* i'd be out of a job
  without folks like you.
* cool.
* here's that ''dog.
* apostrophe-apostrophe
  dog.
* it's short for
  apostrophe-dog.
* which is, in turn,
  short for...
* another one?
* okay.
* careful.
* if you eat
  too many hot dogs...
* you'll probably get
  huge like me.
* huge as in super-
  popular, i mean.
* i'm practically
  a hot-dog tycoon now.
* whoops, you don't have
  enough cash.
* you should get a job.
* i've heard being a
  sentry pays well.
* you're holding too much.
* ... guess i'll just put
  it on your head.
* yeah, you've gotta
  save your money for
  college and spiders.
* hey.
* i heard you're going
  to the core.
* great, thanks for
  treating me.
* well, have fun in
  there.
* guess i have to
  go in the trash
  too.
* we call that
  "the sun," my friend.
* though...
* one thing about you
  always struck me
  as kinda odd.
* now, i understand
  acting in self-defense.
* you were thrown into
  those situations
  against your will.
* but...
* sometimes...
* you act like you
  know what's gonna
  happen.
* like you've already
  experienced it all
  before.
* this is an odd thing
  to say, but...
* if you have some sort
  of special power...
* isn't it your
  responsibility to do
  the right thing?
* ah.
* i see.
* ...
* heh.
* well, that's your
  viewpoint.
* i won't judge you
  for it.
nope.
* that's called snow.
* me too.
   
huh.
always wondered why
people never use
their strongest
attack first.
anyway, as i was
saying, it's a
nice day out.
why not relax and
take a load off?
here we go.
huff... puff...
all right.
that's it.
it's time for my 
special attack.
are you ready?
here goes nothing.
yep.
that's right.
it's literally
nothing.
and it's not gonna
be anything,
either.
heh heh heh...
ya get it?
i know i can't
beat you.
one of your turns...
you're just gonna
kill me.
so, uh.
i've decided...
it's not gonna BE
your turn.
ever.
i'm just gonna
keep having MY
turn until you
give up.
even if it means
we have to stand
here until the
end of time.
capiche?
you'll get bored
here.
if you haven't
gotten bored
already, i mean.
and then, you'll
finally quit.
i know your type.
you're, uh, very
determined, aren't
you?
you'll never give
up, even if
there's, uh...
absolutely NO
benefit to
persevering
whatsoever.
if i can make
that clear.
no matter what,
you'll just keep
going.
not out of any
desire for good
or evil...
but just because
you think you
can.
and because you
"can"...
... you "have to."
but now, you've
reached the end.
there is nothing
left for you now.
so, uh, in my
personal opinion...
the most
"determined"
thing you can
do here?
is to, uh,
completely give
up.
and... (yawn)
do literally
anything else.
heh, didja
really think you
would be able to
so...
guess that's it,
huh?
just...
don't say i
didn't warn you.
welp.
i'm going to
grillby's.
papyrus, do you
want anything?
what?
you think i'm just
gonna stand there
and take it?
our reports showed
a massive anomaly
in the timespace
continuum.
timelines jumping
left and right,
stopping and
starting...
until suddenly,
everything ends.
heh heh heh...
that's your fault,
isn't it?
you can't understand
how this feels.
knowing that one
day, without any
warning...
it's all going to
be reset.
look.
i gave up trying
to go back a long
time ago.
and getting to the
surface doesn't
really appeal
anymore, either.
cause even if we
do...
we'll just end up
right back here,
without any memory
of it, right?
to be blunt...
it makes it kind
of hard to give
it my all.
... or is that just
a poor excuse for
being lazy...?
hell if i know.
all i know is...
seeing what comes
next...
i can't afford not
to care anymore.
ugh...
that being said...
you, uh, really
like swinging that
thing around,
huh?
listen.
i know you didn't
answer me before,
but...
somewhere in
there.
i can feel it.
there's a glimmer
of a good person
inside of you.
the memory of
someone who once
wanted to do the
right thing.
someone who, in
another time,
might have even
been...
a friend?
c'mon, buddy.
do you remember
me?
please, if you're
listening...
let's forget all
this, ok?
just lay down
your weapon, and...
well, my job
will be a lot
easier.
friendship...
it's really great,
right?
let's quit fighting.
welp, it was
worth a shot.
guess you like
doing things the
hard way, huh?
woah, you look
REALLY pissed off...
heheheh...
did i getcha?
well, if you came
back anyway...
i guess that means
we never really
WERE friends, huh?
heh.
don't tell that
to the other
sans-es, ok?
sounds strange, but
before all this i
was secretly hoping
we could be friends.
i always thought the
anomaly was doing
this cause they
were unhappy.
and when they got
what they wanted,
they would stop
all this.
and maybe all they
needed was...
i dunno.
some good food,
some bad laughs,
some nice friends.
but that's
ridiculous,
right?
yeah, you're the
type of person
who won't EVER
be happy.
you'll keep
consuming timelines
over and over,
until...
well.
hey.
take it from me,
kid.
someday...
you gotta learn
when to QUIT.
and that day's
TODAY.
cause...
y'see..
all this fighting
is really tiring
me out.
and if you keep
pushing me...
then i'll be
forced to use my 
special attack.
yeah, my special
attack.
sound familiar?
well, get ready.
cause after the
next move, i'm
going to use it.
so, if you don't
wanna see it, now
would be a good
time to die.
well, here goes
nothing...
survive THIS, and
i'll show you my 
special attack!
you're sparing me?
finally.
buddy.
pal.
i know how hard
it must be...
to make that
choice.
to go back on
everything you've
worked up to.
i want you to
know...
i won't let it
go to waste.
...
c'mere, pal.
it's a beautiful
day outside.
birds are singing,
flowers are
blooming...
on days like these,
kids like you...
birds are singing,
ready?
Should
be
burning
in hell.
nah, i'm rootin for
ya, kid.                                 
just
give
up.
i did.
why
even
try?
you'll
never
see 'em
again.
  geeettttttt
  dunked on!!!
  if we're really
  friends...
  you won't come back.
* hey there.
* this is just a little test.
    
* no. not today.
* actually, hey...
* hate to bother ya, but
  can you do me a favor?
* i was thinking...
* my brother's been
  kind of down lately...
* he's never seen a human
  before. and seeing you
  might just make his day.
* don't worry, he's not
  dangerous.
* even if he tries to be.
* thanks a million.
* i'll be up ahead.
* well, i'll be straight-
  forward with you.
* my brother'd really
  like to see a human...
* so, y'know, it'd
  really help me out...
* if you kept pretending
  to be one.
* don't you only have
  one outfit?
* oh. right.
* good idea.
* say, why don't you
  look over there?
* behold.
* uhhhh...
* actually, i think that's
  a rock.
* uhhhh...
* i think it looks
  familiar...
* because it's a rock?
* hey, what's that in
  front of the rock?
(yes)
* well.
* it's not a rock.
* well, that went well.
* don't sweat it, kid.
* i'll keep an eyesocket
  out for ya.
* ... and you don't even
  bat an eye, huh?
* i think that's called...
* sleeping.
* do you not know...
* who you know?
* i think the human
  has to hold the orb.
* it's right there.
* on the ground.
* trust me.
* there's no way they can
  get past this one.
* trust me.
* there's no way they'll
  skip this one.
* i'm tellin' ya.
* everyone likes word
  searches.
* knew i should have
  put down junior jumble
  instead.
* well, maybe they
  don't like japes.
* what about undyne?
* doesn't she hate
  puzzles?
* that makes sense.
* well?
* what's the holdup?
* that, uh, doesn't look
  very activated.
* hmmm...
* so this human thing
  was a bust, huh?
* without traps and fire?
* me?
* right about something?
* really?
* heheh... the old whoopee
  cushion in the hand
  trick.
* it's ALWAYS funny.
* anyways,
  you're a human, right?
* that's hilarious.
* heh, the old whoopee
  cushion in the hand
  trick...
* wait a sec...
* have you heard it before
  or something?
* you turned around before
  i said to...
* ... weird.
* ... whatever.
* you're a human, right?
* i'm sans.
* sans the skeleton.
* im actually supposed to
  be on watch for
  humans right now.
* but... y'know...
* i dont really care about
  capturing anybody.
* now my brother,
  papyrus...
* he's a human-hunting
  FANATIC.
* hey, actually, I think
  that's him over there.
* i have an idea.
* go through this gate
  thingy.
* yeah, go right through.
* my bro made the bars
  too wide to stop anyone.
* that's, uh.
* your cue to laugh.
* or, uh, to emote
  at all...?
* (gee, lady, you really
  know how to pick
  'em, huh...?)
* OK, that's fine.
* everyone's got their
  own sense of humor.
* Human.
* Don't you know how
  to greet a new pal?
* Turn around and shake
  my hand.
* quick, behind that
  conveniently-shaped
  lamp.
* sup, bro?
* staring at this lamp.
* it's really cool.
* do you wanna look?
* hmm...
* maybe this lamp will
  help you.
* hey, take it easy.
* i've gotten a ton 
  of work done today.
* a skele-ton.
* come on.
* you're smiling.
* wow, sounds like
  you're really working
  yourself...
* down to the bone.
* ok, you can come out
  now.
* uh, ok, i guess you
  don't have to.
* yeah.
* that worked out, huh?
* you oughta get going.
* he might come back.
* and if he does...
* ... you'll have to
  sit through more of
  my hilarious jokes.
* what's the holdup?
* look, there's nothin
  to be afraid of.
* it's just a dark cavern
  filled with skeletons
  and horrible monsters.
* well?
* ... are you just gonna
  stare at me, or...?
* hey, here's something
  important to remember.
* my brother has a very
  special attack.
* if you see a blue
  attack, don't move and
  it won't hurt you.
* here's an easy way to
  keep it in mind.
* imagine a stop sign.
* when you see a stop
  sign, you stop, right?
* stop signs are red.
* so imagine a blue stop
  sign instead.
* simple, right?
* when fighting, think
  about blue stop signs.
* remember...
* blue stop signs.
* hey, thanks...
* my brother seems like
  he's having fun.
* by the way, did you
  see that weird outfit
  he's wearing?
* we made that a few
  weeks ago for a costume
  party.
* he hasn't worn anything
  else since...
* keeps calling it his
  "battle body."
* man.
* isn't my brother cool?
* it would make my
  brother happy if you
  played along.
* thanks for saying
  "junior jumble" just
  to appease my brother.
* yesterday he got
  stumped trying to
  "solve" the horoscope.
* papyrus...
* ... finds difficulty in
  interesting places.
* guess you don't like
  word searches, huh?
* me neither.
* i'm more of a funny
  pages kind of guy.
* i guess despite all
  that, you still like
  word searches, huh...?
* that means you can't
  be all bad.
* actually, that spaghetti
  from earlier...
* it wasn't too bad for
  my brother.
* since he started cooking
  lessons, he's been
  improving a lot.
* i bet if he keeps it
  up, next year he'll even
  make something edible.
* hey...
* puzzles might be fun.
* if you tried them.
* good job on solving it
  so quickly.
* you didn't even need
  my help.
* which is great, 'cause
  i love doing absolutely
  nothing.
* ... you must be really
  good at puzzles,
  huh?
* it's impossible for
  you to have seen
  this one before.
* hey, why didn't you
  ask for help?
* i was right here.
* what's up?
* you sure do like to
  exercise.
* i don't know what my
  brother's going to do
  now.
* if i were you, i would
  make sure i understand
  blue attacks.
* here, i'll give you some
  advice about fighting
  my brother.
* don't.
* capiche?
* hmmm...
* guess we didn't need
  your help to have a
  good time after all.
* say, i've been
  thinking.
* seems like you're
  gonna fight my brother
  pretty soon.
* here's some friendly
  advice.
* if you keep going the
  way you are now...
* you're gonna have a
  bad time.
* dang, i wish i brought
  a parasol.
* i'm getting a nasty burn
  from all this sun.
* say...
* are you following me?
* are you lost?
* grievous error
* let's hang out again
  sometime.
* hey, i really
  respect what you did
  back there.
* over here.
* i know a shortcut.
* well, here we are.
* so.
* your journey's
  almost over, huh?
* you must really
  wanna go home.
* hey.
* i know the feeling,
  buddo.
* though...
* maybe sometimes it's
  better to take what's
  given to you.
* down here you've
  already got food,
  drink, friends...
* is what you have
  to do...
* really worth it?
* ah, forget it.
* i'm rootin' for
  ya, kid.
* let me tell you
  a story.
* so i'm a sentry in
  snowdin forest, right?
* i sit out there
  and watch for humans.
* it's kind of boring.
* fortunately, deep in
  the forest...
* there's this HUGE
  locked door.
* and it's perfect
  for practicing
  knock knock jokes.
* so one day, i'm
  knocking 'em out,
  like usual.
* i knock on the
  door and say
  "knock knock."
* and suddenly, from
  the other side...
* i hear a woman's
  voice.
* "who is there?" 
* so, naturally, I
  respond:
* "dishes."
* "dishes who?"
* "dishes a very
  bad joke."
* then she just
  howls with laughter.
* like it's the best
  joke she's heard
  in a hundred years.
* so I keep 'em
  coming, and she keeps
  laughing.
* she's the best
  audience i've ever
  had.
* then, after a
  dozen of 'em,
  SHE knocks and says...
* "Knock knock!"
* i say "whos
  there?"
* "old lady!"
* "old lady who?"
* "oh! I did not
  know you could
  yodel!"
* wow.
* needless to say,
  this woman was
  extremely good.
* we kept telling
  each other jokes
  for hours.
* eventually, i had
  to leave.
* papyrus gets kind
  of cranky without
  his bedtime story.
* but she told me
  to come by again,
  and so i did.
* then i did again.
* and again.
* it's a thing now.
* telling bad jokes
  through the door.
* it rules.
* one day, though, i
  noticed she wasn't
  laughing very much.
* i asked her what
  was up.
* then she told me
  something strange.
* "if a human ever
  comes through this
  door..."
* "... could you please,
  please promise
  something?"
* "watch over them,
  and protect them,
  will you not?"
* now, i hate making
  promises.
* and this woman,
  i don't even know
  her name.
* but...
* someone who sincerely
  likes bad jokes...
* has an integrity
  you can't say
  "no" to.
* do you get what
  i'm saying?
* that promise i made
  to her...
* you know what would
  have happened if she
  hadn't said anything?
* ... buddy.
* ... You'd be dead
  where you stand.
* hey, lighten up,
  bucko!
* i'm just joking
  with you.
* besides...
* haven't i done a
  great job protecting
  you?
* i mean, look at
  yourself.
* you haven't died
  a single time.
* that's right, isn't
  it?
* well, chalk it
  up to my great
  skills.
* hey, what's that
  look supposed to
  mean?
* am i wrong...?
* heh.
* well, that's all.
* take care of
  yourself, kid.
* 'cause someone really
  cares about you.
* welp.
* someone's gotta keep
  him from getting
  into trouble.
* see you guys.
* yeah.
* you made papyrus cry
  like a baby.
* what did you catch?
* oh man, tori...
* that's brutal.
* well.
* cause we're huge
  dorks.
* then why are you
  smiling?
* hey, frisk, what's
  with that weird
  expression?
* oh boy.
* hey, tori, do you
  have any other
  embarrassing stories?
* oh hey, what's up,
  frisk?
* we were just talking
  about you.
* apparently you asked
  to call tori "mom" right
  after meeting her?
* frisk...
* i gotta tell ya.
* that's, uh, not the
  best way to get
  to know someone.
* frisk, tori was telling
  me how she made
  b'scotch pie for you.
* sorry...
* i don't have time
  to talk, frisk.
* i'm supposed to be
  working right now.
* i know, and it's
  taking all my
  concentration.
* no matter how hard
  you try to get
  rid of him.
* frisk, why don't you
  fly?
* it's faster.
* yeah, what do you...
* whoops.
* doesn't everybody?
* So you finally made it.
* The end of your journey
  is at hand.
* In a few moments, you
  will meet the king.
* Together...
* You will determine the
  future of this world.
* That's then.
* Now.
* You will be judged.
* You will be judged for
  your every action.
* You will be judged for
  every EXP you've earned.
* What's EXP?
* It's an acronym.
* It stands for "execution
  points."
* A way of quantifying the
  pain you have inflicted on
  others.
* When you kill someone,
  your EXP increases.
* When you have enough EXP,
  your LOVE increases.
* LOVE, too, is an
  acronym.
* It stands for "Level of
  Violence."
* A way of measuring someone's
  capacity to hurt.
* The more you kill, the
  easier it becomes to
  distance yourself.
* The more you distance
  yourself, the less you
  will hurt.
* The more easily you
  can bring yourself to
  hurt others.
* So you finally made it...
* Now, you understand.
* It's time to begin your
  judgment.
* Look inside yourself.
* Have you really done the
  right thing?
* And, considering what
  you've done...
* What will you do now?
* Take a moment to think
  about this.
* ... but you.
* you never gained
  any LOVE.
* 'course, that doesn't
  mean you're completely
  innocent or naive.
* just that you kept
  a certain tenderness
  in your heart.
* no matter the struggles
  or hardships you
  faced...
* you strived to do the
  right thing.
* you refused to hurt
  anyone.
* even when you ran
  away, you did it
  with a smile.
* you never gained LOVE,
  but you gained love.
* does that make sense?
* maybe not.
* ...
* now.
* you're about to face
  the greatest challenge
  of your entire journey.
* your actions here...
* will determine the
  fate of the entire
  world.
* if you refuse to
  fight...
* asgore will take
  your soul and
  destroy humanity.
* but if you kill
  asgore and go
  home...
* monsters will remain
  trapped underground.
* what will you do?
* well, if i were you,
  i would have thrown
  in the towel by now.
* but you didn't get
  this far by giving
  up, did you?
* that's right.
* you have something
  called "determination."
* so as long as you
  hold on...
* so as long as you
  do what's in your
  heart...
* i believe you can do
  the right thing.
* alright.
* we're all counting
  on you, kid.
* good luck.
* truthfully, it doesn't
  really matter what you
  said.
* all that's important is
  that you were honest
  with yourself.
* what happens now...
* we leave up to you.
pepis
* Then why'd you
  kill my
  brother?
* You dirty brother
  killer.
* huh?
* you look bored.
* i get the feeling
  you aren't gonna learn
  anything from this.
* well, guess I gotta
  judge you then.
* come on.
* really?
* lv2...
* seems like you messed
  up the slightest amount.
* welp.
* that's pretty sad.
* you probably weren't
  even aware of what you
  were doing...
* and when you learned,
  it was too late.
* nah, just kidding.
* who gets to lv2 on
  accident?
* get outta here.
* lv3...
* 3's just an ok number,
  i guess.
* i'll give you a C+.
* you can do better,
  right?
* hmmm...
* over lv3, huh.
* you killed some people
  on purpose, didn't you?
* that's probably bad.
* though, maybe some
  of it was in self-
  defense...
* i don't know.
* help me out here.
* i wasn't watching.
* anyways, don't do that.
* hmmm...
* over lv9, huh.
* that's over halfway to
  lv20, the maximum.
* but don't think that
  means you're still 50-
  percent good.
* 50-percent, 20-percent.
* those are both still
  failing grades.
* besides.
* chances are...
* i've already tried to
  steer you in the right
  direction.
* so what can i say?
* what can i say that
  will change the mind of
  a being like you...?
* hmmm...
* over lv14, huh.
* well, hmmm...
* judgment-wise...
* you're a pretty bad
  person.
* you wander around,
  looking for people...
* killing them to take
  their money.
* that's just plain
  messed up.
* and what's worse, is
  that as bad as you
  are...
* you aren't anywhere near
  as bad as you could
  be.
* you pretty much suck
  at being evil.
* honestly, it's super
  embarrassing.
* but maybe you'd be
  better...
* at not killing anyone?
* crazy idea, huh?
* let me know how that
  one goes.
* ... huh?
* what's with that look
  in your eye?
* did you go through and
  kill someone...
* just to see what i'd
  say about it?
* wow.
* you're a pretty gross
  person, huh?
* huh?
* you STILL look bored.
* okay then, consider
  our session over.
* wait a second.
* that look on your
  face while i was
  talking...
* you've already heard
  my spiel, haven't you?
* i suspected something
  like this.
* you're always acting
  like you know what's
  going to happen.
* like you've seen it
  all before.
* so...
* i have a request for
  you.
* i kind of have a
  secret codeword 
  that only i know.
* so i know if someone
  tells it to me...
* they'll have to be a
  time traveller.
* crazy, right?
* anyway, here it is...
* (whisper, whisper)
* i'm counting on you to
  come back here and
  tell me that.
* see you later.
* huh?
* do you have something
  to say to me?
* what? a codeword?
* can you speak a
  little louder?
* did you...
* ... just say "i'm a
  stupid doodoo butt?"
* wow.
* i can't believe you
  would say that.
* not only is that
  completely infantile...
* but it's also my
  secret codeword.
* that, however, isn't
  good enough.
* what you need is the
  secret secret codeword.
* it's only for people
  that know the secret
  codeword.
* anyway, here it is...
* (whimsper, whimsper)...
* ... just say "i'm the
  legendary fartmaster?"
* wow.
* that's... uh...
* really childish.
* why would you think
  that was a secret
  secret codeword?
* whoever told you that
  is a dirty liar.
* i don't have a secret
  secret codeword.
* however.
* i do have a secret
  secret triple-secret
  codeword.
* which you just said.
* so, i guess you're
  qualified.
* here's the key to my
  room.
* it's time...
* you learned the truth.
* huh?
* triple secret codeword?
* nah, i'm out of
  material.
* heya.
* you've been busy,
  huh?
* so, i've got a
  question for ya.
* do you think even
  the worst person can
  change...?
* that everybody can be
  a good person, if
  they just try?
* you look frustrated
  about something.
* guess i'm pretty good
  at my job, huh?
* hmm.
* that expression...
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  twice in a row.
* suffice to say, you
  look really...
* unsatisfied.
* all right.
* how 'bout we make it
  a third?
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  thrice in a row.
* hey, what comes after
  "thrice," anyway?
* wanna help me find out?
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  quice in a row.
* quice?
* frice?
* welp, won't have to
  use it again anyways.
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  five times in a row.
* convenient, huh?
* that's one for each
  finger.
* but soon...
* you'll need a cool
  mutant hand to count
  all of your deaths.
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  six times in a row.
* that's the number of
  fingers on a mutant
  hand.
* you'll need to find
  a mutant hand with
  even more fingers.
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  seven times in a row.
* hey, that's good.
* seven's supposed to be
  a lucky number.
* who knows, maybe
  you'll hit the
  jackpot...
* and that number will
  multiply tenfold.
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  eight times in a row.
* that's the number of
  fingers on a spider.
* wait, don't spiders
  have legs?
* nope, wait, that's
  definitely nine, sorry.
* or was it ten?
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  ten times in a row.
* hey, congrats!
* the big one-oh!
* let's invite all your
  friends over for a
  big shindig.
* we can have pie, and
  hot dogs, and...
* hmmm... wait.
* something's not right.
* you don't have any
  friends.
* that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  eleven times in a row.
* well, give or take.
* there's nuance to
  this stuff.
* don't think i'll be
  able to count very
  well from here.
* count for me, ok?
* we'll start from 12.
* let's just get to
  the point.
* that expression that
  you're wearing...
* well, i won't grace
  it with a description.
* you're really kind
  of a freak, huh?
* heh heh heh heh...
* all right.
* well, here's a better
  question.
* do you wanna have
  a bad time?
* 'cause if you take
  another step
  forward...
* you are REALLY not
  going to like what
  happens next.
* welp.
* sorry, old lady.
* this is why i never
  make promises.
* fast shortcut, huh?
* hey, everyone.
* nah, i haven't had
  breakfast in at least
  half an hour.
* you must be thinking
  of brunch.
* here, get comfy.
* eh, forgeddaboudit.
* you can have mine.
* i'm not hungry anyway.
* anyway, cool or not,
  you have to agree
  papyrus tries real hard.
* like how he keeps
  trying to be part of
  the royal guard.
* one day, he went to
  the house of the head
  of the royal guard...
* and begged her to
  let him be in it.
* of course, she shut
  the door on him because
  it was midnight.
* but the next day, she
  woke up and saw him
  still waiting there.
* seeing his dedication,
  she decided to give
  him warrior training.
* it's, uh, still a
  work in progress.
* oh yeah, I wanted
  to ask you something.
* welp, that was a
  long break.
* i can't believe i let
  ya pull me away from
  work for that long.
* just kidding.
* grillby, put it on
  my tab.
* by the way...
* ... i was going to say
  something, but i forgot.
hey
guys...
what's
up?
oh hey...
i recognize your
voice, too.
the
name's
sans.
and, uh,
same.
huh?
you haven't
beaten
this guy yet?
come on, this
weirdo's got
nothin' on you.
Sans (call)
* hey.
* is your refrigerator
  running?
* nice.
* i'll be over to deposit
  the brewskis.
* ok, i'll send someone
  over to fix it.
* thanks for letting me
  know.
* good communication is
  important.
* don't worry.
* i am.
* yep.
* that's why i'm
  missing work, too.
* light sea green.
* light sea foam
  green.
* are you kidding?
* spiders love to surf
  the web.
* the sign outside
  says "lab."
* like... laboratory.
* i mean.
* i wouldn't rule it
  out.
* heya.
* is anyone there...?
* well, i'll just leave
  a message...
* well... just calling
  to say.
* you made a snowman
  really happy.
* ... guess i should
  say something else,
  too.
* it's been a while.
* shouldn't you SAVE?
* well... just calling
  to ask.
* did you ever take
  off that gross
  bandage...?
* did you ever get
  something to eat?
* you really like to
  challenge yourself,
  huh...?
* well... good job.
* just promise not to
  brag about it,
  okay?
* alright, i've got the
  number.
* so...
* it's been a while.
* the queen returned, and
  is now ruling over
  the underground.
* she's enstated a new
  policy...
* all the humans who fall
  here will be treated
  not as enemies...
* but as friends.
* it's probably for the
  best, anyway.
* the human souls the king
  gathered...
* seem to have
  disappeared.
* so, uh, that plan
  ain't happening any
  time soon.
* but even though people
  are heartbroken over
  the king...
* ... and things are
  looking grim for our
  freedom...
* the queen's trying her
  best not to let us
  give up hope.
* so, uh, hey...
* if we're not giving
  up down here...
* don't give up wherever
  you are, ok?
* who knows how long
  it will take...
* but we will get out
  of here.
* that's a promise.
* oh, nobody.
* here, knock yourself
  out.
* we wouldn't get the
  phone back for at
  least a few hours.
* oh, whoops.
* this thing's almost
  outta batteries.
* so, hate to cut this
  short, but...
* be seeing you, ok,
  buddy?
* the queen returned, and
  attempted to resume
  ruling the underground.
* she enstated a new
  policy...
* all the humans who fall
  here would be treated
  not as enemies...
* ...
* but people REALLY
  didn't like that
  policy.
* because of you, not
  only was the king
  gone...
* but the human souls
  had gone missing as
  well...
* along with the lives
  of countless citizens.
* along with the life
  of...
* along with the life
  of undyne, their
  greatest hero.
* nobody wanted to see
  that happen ever again.
* so the people started
  a rebellion to
  overthrow the queen.
* but, she, uh, pretty
  much gave up peacefully
  when she realized.
* so she went back
  to the ruins.
* the underground's
  basically an uneasy
  anarchy now.
* everyone's trying to
  live life like they
  always have...
* but it's not really
  easy, you know?
* when all of your
  hope has pretty much
  been thrown away...
* undyne spearheaded
  the revolution, of
  course.
* she was pretty mad
  after what happened
  to asgore.
* she was pretty mad
  after what happened
  to asgore and alphys.
* she threw the queen
  out of the castle
  with her strength.
* then she became the
  empress of the
  underground...
* and banished the
  queen back to the
  ruins.
* seems like undyne's...
* hmmm...
* even more vehement
  about destroying
  humanity than ASGORE.
* ...
* but hey!
* it's not all bad!
* she's not so lonely
  anymore.
* me and papyrus go
  and visit her...
* we bring her books
  from the library,
  or play games...
* we've even convinced
  her to leave
  sometimes.
* as long as me or
  papyrus stay behind
  to watch for humans.
* but papyrus loves
  doing that.
* papyrus says hi.
* well, i hope things
  are better where
  you are.
* later.
* when the queen went
  back to the ruins...
* i decided to go
  with her.
* and i took out some
  books from the
  library, too.
* so she won't have
  to read the same
  ones.
* she's a good roomie.
* we have a lot of
  fun.
* you know.
* sometimes the queen
  talks about...
* how she'd like to
  see you again.
* isn't that nice?
* i don't have the
  heart to tell her
  what you did.
* do you know how she'd
  react?
* if i told her that
  'cause she protected
  you...
* ... you went on to
  kill my brother...?
* anyway, never come
  back here.
* you are not welcome.
* since you left,
  things down here...
* are different.
* with ASGORE gone...
* undyne became the
  ruler of the
  underground.
* she's decided to
  destroy every human
  that comes here.
* and since the human
  souls disappeared...
* she's also looking
  for a new way to
  break the barrier...
* and when she does,
  she's going to wage
  war on humanity.
* i mean, that was
  asgore's plan, too.
* but he was really,
  uh, bad at it.
* undyne has also
  expanded the royal
  guard massively.
* she says the first
  thing she'll do after
  we get out of here...
* is take her army...
* and personally hunt
  you down and destroy
  you.
* meanwhile...
* i've been knocking
  on the door to
  the RUINs...
* but the woman that's
  there hasn't been
  answering me.
* maybe she's not
  feeling well?
* heh.
* or maybe she's not
  feeling anything at
  all...?
* you'd better watch
  yourself, kid.
* things are lookin
  real bad for you.
* i've been knocking on
  the door to the
  RUINS...
* but that woman hasn't
  been answering me...
* oh, just the human.
* sure, knock yourself
  out.
* so, it's been a
  while.
* since you left, things
  have...
* gotten interesting.
* with ASGORE gone, the
  people looked to
  undyne to rule...
* but she was nowhere
  to be found.
* so mettaton just
  kind of...
* took over?
* he's brainwashed
  everyone with his
  stupid TV show.
* and made the
  underground into his
  personal paradise.
* it's honestly...
* kinda disturbing.
* as for me?
* oh, yeah...
* i'm his agent.
* so..
* it's been a while.
* since you left...
* things have gotten
  really strange.
* overnight, a bunch of
  people mysteriously
  disappeared.
* as well as the
  human souls.
* people were heart-
  broken. everyone they
  looked up to...
* everything they were
  relying on, in one
  night, disappeared.
* everyone clamored to
  elect a new ruler as
  fast as possible.
* so, uh...
* by process of
  elimination...
* papyrus became the
  ruler?
* why doesn't he talk
  to you about this...
* we can't judge
  humans to be all
  good or all bad.
* it's been a while,
  huh?
* things have gotten
  pretty bad here.
* everyone considered a
  leader disappeared
  overnight.
* it's gotten so quiet.
* there's a bad feeling
  hanging over
  everyone.
* like everyone's just
  going to die here,
  trapped in the dark...
* ... i bet you're
  wondering why i'm
  not the ruler.
* eh.
* i'm not cut out
  for something like
  that.
* i like to take it
  easy, you know?
* ... that's a joke.
* this is what happens
  when people like me
  take it easy.
* see ya.
* hey, at least things
  are less crowded.
* 'cause of all the
  people you killed.
* hope that was a good
  experience for you.
* just kidding.
* i don't really hope
  that.
* go to hell.
* it seems a number of
  important people
  disappeared overnight.
* but no one else was
  harmed.
* the people were
  confused.
* it was complete bedlam.
* somehow, at the end of
  the day...
* a small, white dog
  became president of
  the underground.
* it sleeps on the
  throne and does
  absolutely nothing.
* strangely, it seems
  this is the best
  life for everyone.
* thanks.
* i'll be honest.
* i have no idea what
  happened for you
  to get here.
* this is actually some
  sort of error-
  handling message.
* so, if you're getting
  this ending...
* tell whoever made the
  game, okay?
* they'll fix it, or
  if it's a novel
  situation...
* they might even add
  another ending to
  the game.
* chances are, though...
* you're just a dirty
  hacker, aren't you?
* yeah, get outta here.
Sans (message)

Scared Donut Guy
* I... I... I ended up buying a
  donut...
* I... I... I didn't want to, but
  that girl... even though I told
  her no, she...
* ... kept staring at me in this
  creepy way and licking her
  lips.
* N... now I'm outta cash.
* Maybe I can sell it online
  and double my money back...
* On the surface, I won't
  buy any donuts from
  spiders.
* That's my resolution.
Scarf Lady
* I love working on the
  newspaper.
* There's so little to report
  that we just fill it with
  comics and games.
* Yes.
* I illustrate all of the
  comics myself.
* Yes.
* I give everyone huge beautiful
  eyes and giant muscles.
* Oh my, there's so much
  news to report, I don't know
  where to begin!
* How about this headline...
* "Monsters Go Free From The
  Underground."
* Nah, that doesn't have
  enough pizazz...
* How about "Top 10 Monsters
  You Won't Believe Got Freed
  From The Underground?"
* Oh, sorry.
* I'm still writing that one.
Scarf Lady (book)
* (Here I am...
* Writing this book.)
* (A person comes in and picks
  up the book...)
* (They start reading it...!)
Scarf Mouse
* Everyone is always laughing
  and cracking jokes, trying
  to forget our modern crises...
* Dreariness.
* Crowding.
* Lack of sunlight.
* I would join them, but I'm
  just not very funny.
* At least I'm not making puns.
* Wait!
* I've got a joke!
* Knock knock!
* ... Uh.
* That's all I've thought of.
* Looks like I don't have
  to worry about cracking
  jokes anymore.
* I was going to say a joke
  here, but I really don't
  have one.
* It just feels like...
* Like everything is getting
  worse and worse.

Skateboard Girl
* We were hanging out

  reactivated out of nowhere.
* This is a huge problem...
* It rules! They've GOTTA
  cancel school over this!
* Wait a second...

* Hey, did you hear?

Snowdin Knock Lover

Snowdin Shopkeeper
* Take your time.
* Hello, traveller.
* How can I help you?
What would
you like
to buy?
Thanks for
your
purchase.
Just
looking?
That's not
enough
money.
You're
carrying
too much.
Care to
chat?
* Huh?
* Sell somethin'?
* Does this look like a
  pawn shop?
* I don't know how it works where
  you come from... but...
* If I started spending money
  on old branches and used
  bandages, I'd be out of business
  in a jiffy!
* If you're really hurtin' for
  cash, then maybe you could
  do some crowdfunding.
* I hear people will pay for
  ANYTHING nowadays.
* Bye now!
* Come again sometime!
* Hiya! Welcome to Snowdin!
* I can't remember the last
  time I saw a fresh face around
  here.
* Where did you come from?
* The capital?
* You don't look like a tourist.
* Are you here by yourself?
* I mean, it happened to you,
  right?
* There was a strange flash of
  white light...
* Then I felt my body being pulled
  into... something.
* Then, suddenly, everything was
  back to normal.
* You want to know what to do
  here in Snowdin?
* Grillby's has food, and the
  library has information...
* If you're tired, you can take
  a nap at the inn.
* It's right next door - my sister
  runs it.
* And if you're bored, you can
  sit outside and watch those wacky
  skeletons do their thing.
* There's two of 'em...
* Brothers, I think.
* They just showed up one day
  and...
* ... asserted themselves.
* The town has gotten a lot
  more interesting since then.
* I heard that it was all 'cause
  a human came through here.
* A human...
* I can hardly believe it!
* Well if they decide to stop
  in, I'll be sure to give
  them a hero's welcome.
* Think back to your history
  class...
* A long time ago, monsters lived
  in the RUINS back there in
  the forest.
* Long story short, we all decided
  to leave the ruins and head
  for the end of the caverns.
* Along the way, some fuzzy folk
  decided they liked the cold
  and set up camp in Snowdin.
* Oh, and don't think about
  trying to explore the RUINS...
* The door's been locked for
  ages.
* So unless you're a ghost
  or can burrow under the door,
  forget about it.
* Didja hear?
* The RUINS have been opened up,
  and get this...
* They were opened from the
  INSIDE.
* Apparently the Queen had been
  staying inside there for God
  knows how long.
* Pretty unbelievable, huh!?
* Life is the same as usual.
* A little claustrophobic...
* But... we all know deep down
  that freedom is coming, don't we?
* As long as we got that hope, we
  can grit our teeth and face the
  same struggles, day after day...
* That's life, ain't it?
* Well, I suppose I'll move
  my store to the overworld...
* ... haven't planned much
  more than that, I'm afraid.
Snowdin Shopkeeper (note)
* Please don't hurt my family.

ASRIEL, wracked
with grief,
absorbed the
human's SOUL.
He transformed
into a being
with incredible
power.
* I ran away from home.
* Why?
* 'Cause my father was so
  "cold" to me...
* WHAT!?
* It's a JOKE!!
* LAUGH at it!!
* I really don't!
* I don't care if he doesn't
  like my jokes!
* Mom might have to share her
  mind with other people now,
  but she's still my mom.
* And that's "cool!"
* 'Cause, uhh, we're made
  of ice and stuff.
* WHAT!?!?
* It's a JOKE!!
* LAUGH at it!!
Snowdrake's Father
* I'm the resort comedian.
* I'm very funny.
* People laugh at my jokes.
* Now, my son.
* He wants to be a comedian
  like his fathah.
* But his jokes.
* Aren't funny.
* He tells these awful puns.
* He's an embarrassment to
  our family.
* That's not funny.
* Since his mothah passed on,
  he couldn't stand.
* Living at home anymore.
* So he ran away.
* I haven't seen him since.
* I'm a terrible fathah.
* Ha ha ha ha...
* That's not funny.
* Talking to you about
  this...
* It's breakin' my heart.
* The doctah.
* She brought my wife.
* Back from the dead.
* My son.
* He seems happy again.
* Our family.
* It's biggah than evah.
* Now that my wife.
* Is combined.
* With 16 othah people.
* My boss stopped answering my
  calls.
* I don't know when my next
  performance will be.
* Maybe I shouldn't try to be
  a comedian anymore...
* It's tearing my family apart.
* My son...
* He was always making these
  weird ice puns.
* I hated them, so he ran
  away from home...
* I think I should try to
  patch things up with him.
* Have you seen him?
* Have you seen my son?

Snowed Inn Keeper
* Welcome to Snowed Inn!
* Snowdin's premier hotel!
* Back again?
* Well, stay as long as you
  like.
* What?
* No, you can't get a
  second key!
* Hello!
* Sorry, no time for a
  nap...
* Snowed Inn is shutting
  down so we can all go
  to the surface.
* Oh, there you are.
* I was worrying about
  you!
* Things are going to be OK,
  you hear?
* We're all going to the
  surface world soon...
* There's bound to be a
  place you can stay there!
* Here's your room key.
* Make sure to bundle up!
* ... You don't even have 80G?
* Oh! You poor thing.
* I can only imagine what
  you've been through.
* One of the rooms upstairs
  is empty.
* You can sleep there for
  free, okay?
* You aren't carrying enough
  money.
* Well, feel free to come
  back any time.
* Hiya!
* You look like you
  had a great sleep.
* Which is incredible, because
  you were only up there for
  about two minutes...
* Here's your money back.
* You can pay me if you're
  going to stay overnight.
* Feel free to come back
  if you get tired.
Snowed Inn Keeper and Frisk
* One night is 80G.
 
         Stay        Leave
* How about it?
 
         Stay        Leave
Snowed Inn Keeper's Child
* Mom says that sleeping
  can recover your health
  above your maximum HP.
* ... what's maximum HP?
* Mom says that we can
  go to the surface world
  now!
* ... what's so great about
  that, anyway?
* I don't wanna move.
Snowman
* I shouldn't have given myself
  away so easily...
* Did you just...
* Consume the part of me
  I had given you?
* In front of my very eyes!?
* I have no words for you...
* Begone!
* Thank you for taking care
  of me...
* Huh? Again...?
* I'm sorry... if I give you
  any more, there will be
  nothing left of me.
* I suppose it is true.
* Travelling beyond our limits
  is but a fantasy.
* It's no different for
  anyone else.
* All of monsterkind
  are doomed to stay
  underground, forever...
* How am I doing?
* By "I" I mean the piece
  of me I gave you...
* Huh? You lost it...?
* ... I suppose I can give
  you another piece...
* You don't have any room?
* OK... I understand I am not
  a priority for you, then.
* Please be careful this
  time.
* Hello.
* I am a snowman.
* I want to see the world...
* But I cannot move.
* If you would be so kind,
  traveller, please...
* It seems you do not
  have enough room for me.
* Thank you... good luck!
* I see.
* Good journey, then.
* Oh?
* About that piece I gave you?
* ... I never gave you anything.
* Ah... I can feel that piece
  of me has been well taken
  care of.
* Hmmm...?
* The barrier's opened up?
* Hmmm...
* Then, if it's not too much
  to ask...
* ... could you take that
  piece of me to the surface?
* I would really appreciate
  it.
* So, did you take that
  piece of me very far
  away...?
* Where's the piece!?
* Ah, the barrier's open...?
* You know I cannot move.
* Why are you telling me?
* To mock me?
* Everyone may think you are a
  good person, but this snowman
  knows the truth.
* Someday, your friends will
  realize your heart is as
  cold as my butt.
* Hello.
* I am a snowman.
* I cannot move.
* Traveller, if you could...
* Oh me, oh my.
* What are you doing?
* Soon there won't be any
  of me left...
* Stop...
* Please...
Snowman and Frisk
* Take a piece of me and
  bring it very far away.
         Yes         No       
So Sorry
AHHHHHHH!!!!!
AHHHHH!!!
Oh!
Whoops!
That hurt!
So sorry, I must
have gotten in the
way!
I really shouldn't
stand so close
Ah I'm just being
troublesome
Darn it, I keep
getting in the way
So sorry, I'm such
an oaf
Wandering in front
of you...
Are you...
trying to KILL me?
... so sorry, but
I've had a really
tough year.
I don't know if I
could take you
killing me on top
of everything.
You should find
someone else to
kill.
So sorry.
?????
I just said I'm
not interested in
the offer!!
...
Sorry, I must not
have enunciated
clearly enough.
I am not interested
in being killed.
Thank you very much.
Look, stranger
I... I guess I'm
going to have to
tell the truth.
My whole life, I've
never been worth a
lot of EXP.
Everyone else at my
work, in my classes,
Would raise a
person's LV by 4
or 5 when
destroyed...
But me?
I wouldn't even
increase your LV
at LV 1.
For this reason...
I...
I've always been...
I've never been
very good at
getting killed.
So...
I'm flattered
that you...
Want to destroy me.
But you are making
a big waste of
your time!!
Stop killing me!!!
OK, OK. Hm.
If you stop killing
me, I'll pay you
200G.
220G?
300G?
W...
Wait a second.
You trying to
kill me...
C...
could it be...?
Because you
don't like me
very much...?
No, no, that
can't be!
This is just a
friendly, um,
killing between
acquaintances!!!
Pals... we're...
we're still pals,
right!!
OK, maybe not
PALS, but, uh,
Friendly strangers?
You know, just
one step away from
being buds!!!
I mean, I was
practically...
I was about to
crack open the
sparkling cider!
Pull out some
baguettes and some
swiss cheese!
BLOW ON A FREAKING
PARTY HORN!!!
N... no, you don't
like me either,
huh...?
Nobody likes me...
they're just putting
up with me
I'm just annoying
you... I should just
leave
ARRRRRGHHHH!!!
Why am I such an
idiot??!?!!!!
How did I not
see it before!!!
You weren't killing
me because you
LIKED me!!!
NOBODY does that!
 That's NOT a thing!
Oh. Sorry. I was
being too loud.
Ugh.
I'm wasting your
time, aren't I...?
... whew, I feel
really...
strange.
I think I need to
go home and lie
down.
Oh, I'm so sorry!
How clumsy of me...
I've bumped into you
I'm such a klutz.
I was just here to
find something to
draw, and...
Oh no, it's ok!
It's OK!
I'll give you a
gift to make up
for your troubles.
Let me look in
my vest!
Ummm, I couldn't
find anything I
want to give away.
Wait, wait!
I've got my notebook!
I can draw you a
picture in it!
I'm quite the artist,
you know.
I'll draw you a
GREAT picture!!!
S.. sorry...
The drawing didn't
come out very well.
Wait!
I know the problem!
I just have to
find a better piece
of paper for it!
None of my papers
are good enough to
use...
IT'S OK!!!
I know what I
can do!!
I'll use my magic
pencil!
It has to be under
some of these papers
somewhere!!!!
Here!
I got it!
My magic pencil is
amazing!
Everything I draw
with it looks...
COMPLETELY REAL!
I've messed up.
I've really messed up.
Oh no.
I'll just use a
regular pencil!
I'll try my best!
Are you ready!?
I just finished.
Here's your picture!
What do you think!?
It's a representation
of your deepest
essence...
It's great, right!?
(They think my art
is terrible.)
Well!
I'll leave you with
that thought!
Goodbye!
See you later!
Sayonara!
Nice knowing ya!
Hasta la vista.
I should leave.
Oh, and...
About all this.
Um.
Sorry.
Uuuuhhhh, oh no!!
That's a little too
real!
* Ahhhh!!!
* I'm late!!!
* I'm late!!!
* I'm so sorry!!!

Toriel
* This way.
* Welcome to your new
  home, innocent one.
* Allow me to educate you
  in the operation of the
  RUINS.
* The RUINS are full of
  puzzles.
* Ancient fusions between 
  diversions and doorkeys.
* One must solve them
  to move from room to
  room.
* Please adjust yourself    to the sight of them.
* To make progress here, 
  you will need to trigger
  several switches.
* Do not worry, I have 
  labelled the ones that
  you need to flip.
* Do not worry, I have 
  labelled the ones that
  you need to flip.
* ... eh?
* It seems that the
  labelling has worn away.
* Oh dear.
* This might be far more
  challenging than I
  anticipated...
* The first switch is over
  on the wall.
* Do you need some help..?
* Press the switch on the   wall.
* Come on, you can do it!
* Go on, press the switch
  on the left.
* I believe it was
  the switch on the
  left.
* You do know which way
  left is, do you not?
* Press the switch that I
  labelled for you.
* You do know which way
  left is, do you not?
* You are very curious, 
  are you not?
* Please understand. 
 I only want the best
  for you.
* Splendid! 
* I am proud of you, 
  little one.
* Let us move to the
  next room.
* As a human living in
  the UNDERGROUND, 
  monsters may attack you.
* You will need to be
  prepared for this
  situation.
* However, worry not! 
* The process is simple.
* When you encounter a 
  monster, you will enter
  a FIGHT.
* While you are in a
  FIGHT, strike up a
  friendly conversation.
* Stall for time.
  I will come to resolve
  the conflict.
* Practice talking to
  the dummy.
* Ahh, the dummies are
  not for fighting! 
* They are for talking!
* We do not want to hurt
  anybody, do we...?  
* Come now.
* Ah, very good! 
* You are very good.
* ...
* ... you ran away...
* Truthfully, that was
  not a poor choice.
* It is better to
  avoid conflict
  whenever possible.
* That... however, is
  only a dummy.
* It cannot harm you.
* It is made of cotton.
* It has no desire
  for revenge...
* Nevermind.
* Stay close to me and
  I will keep you safe.
* ...
* ...
* The next room awaits.
* Practice talking to
  the dummy.
* You can say anything... 
* I do not think the dummy
  will be bothered.
* Do you need some
  ideas for conversation
  topics?
* Well, I often start with
  a simple 'how do you
  do...'
* You could ask them about
  their favorite books...
* Jokes can be useful for
  'breaking the ice.'
* Listen to this one...
* What did the skeleton
  tile his roof with?
* ... SHIN-gles!
* Well, I thought it
  was amusing.
* You can say anything... 
* The dummy will not
  be bothered.
* There is another puzzle
  in this room...
* I wonder if you can
  solve it?
* This is the puzzle,
  but...
* Here, take my hand
  for a moment.
* Puzzles seem a little
  too dangerous for
  now.
...
* Greetings, my child.
* Do not worry, I did
  not leave you.
* I was merely behind this
  pillar the whole time.
* Thank you for trusting
  me.
* However, there was an
  important reason for
  this exercise.
* ... to test your
  independence.
* I must attend to some
  business, and you must
  stay alone for a while.
* Please remain here.
* It's dangerous to
  explore by yourself.
* I have an idea.
* I will give you a
  CELL PHONE.
* If you have a need for
  anything, just call.
* Be good, alright?
* You have done
  excellently thus
  far, my child.
* However... I have a
  difficult request to ask
  of you.
* ...
* I would like you to walk
  to the end of the room
  by yourself.
* Forgive me for this.
* Hello there,
  little one!
* The pie has not
  cooled down yet.
* Sweet dreams.
* You'd rather stay
  up and chat with
  me, then?
* Up already, I see?
* Um, I want you to know
  how glad I am to
  have someone here.
* There are so many
  old books I want
  to share.
* I want to show you
  my favorite bug-
  hunting spot.
* I've also prepared
  a curriculum for
  your education.
* This may come as
  a surprise to you...
* But I have always
  wanted to be a
  teacher.
* ... actually, perhaps
  that isn't very
  surprising.
* STILL.
* I am glad to have
  you living here.
* Oh, did you
  want something?
* Well, talk to me
  again if you
  need anything.
* What?
* This... this IS your
  home now.
* Um... would you like
  to hear about this
  book I am reading?
* Oh, hello!
* Did you want to
  hear about the
  book I am reading?
* It is called
  "72 Uses for Snails."
* Here is an exciting
  snail fact.
* Um...
* How about an exciting
  snail fact?
* Did you know
  that snails...
* Have a chainsaw-like
  tongue called a
  radula?
* Sometimes flip their
  digestive systems
  as they mature?
* Make terrible
  shoelaces?
* Talk. Really. Slowly?
* Just kidding, snails
  don't talk.
* Well, bother me
  if you need anything
  else.
* ... I have to do
  something.
* Stay here.
* If you need anything,
  just ask.
* ... I have to do
  something.
* Stay here..
What a terrible
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent youth...
Ah, do not be
afraid, my child.
I am TORIEL,
caretaker of
the RUINS.
I pass through this
place every day to
see if anyone has
fallen down.
You are the first
human to come here
in a long time.
I will do my best
to ensure your
protection during
your time here.
Come!
I will guide you
through the
catacombs.
* Oh, may I enter
  the trash as well?
* On second thought,
  do not put me
  in the trash.
* Oh my...
* Yes, it is beautiful,
  is it not?
* But we should really
  think about what comes
  next.
* Frisk...
* You came from this
  world, right...?
* So you must have
  a place to return to,
  do you not?
* What will you do
  now?
* Welcome to your new
  home, innocent one.
* Allow me to educate you
  in the operation of
  the RUINS.
I think you should
think of your own
name, my child.
   
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 ...?
 What are
 you
 doing?
 Attack
 or run
 away!
 What are
 you
 proving
 this way?
 Fight me
 or
 leave!
 Stop it.
 Stop
 looking
 at me
 that way.
 Go away!
 ...
 ...
 ...
I know you want
to go home, but...
But please... go
upstairs now.
I promise I will
take good care
of you here.
I know we do not
have much, but...
We can have a
good life here.
Why are you
making this so
difficult?
Please, go upstairs.
.....
Ha ha...
Pathetic, is it not?
I cannot save even
a single child.
No, I understand.
You would just be
unhappy trapped
down here.
The RUINS are very
small once you
get used to them.
It would not be
right for you to
grow up in a
place like this.
My expectations...
My loneliness...
My fear...
For you, my child...
I will put them aside.
Urgh...
You are stronger
than I thought...
Listen to me,
 small one...
If you go beyond
this door,
Keep walking as
far as you can.
Eventually you will
reach an exit.
...
....
ASGORE...
Do not let ASGORE 
take your soul.
His plan
cannot be allowed
to succeed.
......
Be good,
won't you?
My child.      
Y... you...
really hate me
that much?
Now I see who I
was protecting by
keeping you here.
Not you...
But them!
Ha... ha... 
You...
... at my most
vulnerable
moment...
To think I was
worried you
wouldn't fit
in out there...
Eheheheh!!!
You really are
no different than
them!
This is
for your
own
good.
No one
will
leave
again.
Your fate is up to
you now!
Eh??
You are ending
it NOW?
And on such a
dramatic moment...?
But there WILL be
more, will there
not?
Well.
What is the point
of that now?
Hmmm.
Perhaps I will
bake another pie.
That last one ended
up a little burnt.
You are just going
to eat it all...
Snoring on the
floor is NOT help.
It's over.
* No no no!
* You want to press the
  other switch.
* I even labelled it for
  you...
* It seems that is not
  the correct switch.
* Do not worry about
  me.
* Someone has to take
  care of these flowers.
* Hello...
* Are you all right?
* You must be so lost
  and confused...
* Ah, do not be
  afraid, my child.
* I am TORIEL,
  caretaker of the
  RUINS.
* I pass through here
  every day to see if
  anyone has fallen down.
* You are the first
  human to come here
  in a long time.
* I will do my best
  to protect you during
  your time here.
* Come!
* I shall guide you
  through the catacombs.
* How did you get
  here, my child?
* Are you hurt?
* Not a scratch...
* Impressive!
* But still...
* There, there, I will
  heal you.
* Who did this to you? 
* You will get an apology.
* I should not have
  left you alone
  for so long.
* It was irresponsible
  to try to surprise
  you like this.
* Err...
* Well, I suppose I
  cannot hide it
  any longer.
* Come, small one!
* Oh dear, that took
  longer than I
  thought it would.
* Do you smell that?
* Surprise!
* It is a butterscotch-
  cinnamon pie.
* I thought we might
  celebrate your
  arrival.
* I want you to have
  a nice time living
  here.
* So I will hold off
  on snail pie for
  tonight.
* Here, I have another
  surprise for you.
* Er, I assume that
  expression means you
  do.
* S... surprise!
* I have baked a snail
  pie.
* So I...
* Here, I have another
  surprise for you.
* This is it...
* Is something burning...?
* Um, make yourself
  at home!
* A room of your own.
* I hope you like it!
* I think you should
  play upstairs
  instead.
* It is dangerous
  to play here.
* It is drafty here.
* You will catch
  a cold.
* It is dusty here.
* You will catch
  a cough.
* There is nothing
  to see here.
* Do you want to
  read a book?
* I do not like
  the game you
  are playing.
* Why not go for
  a walk in the
  yard?
* Really now.
* ...
* Hey, do not go down
  here.
* I have something
  to show you
  upstairs.
* You wish to know how
  to return "home,"
  do you not?
* Ahead of us lies the
  end of the RUINS.
* A one-way exit to the
  rest of the underground.
* I am going to destroy
  it.
* No one will ever
  be able to leave
  again.
* Now be a good child
  and go upstairs.
* Every human that falls
  down here meets
  the same fate.
* I have seen it
  again and again.
* They come.
* They leave.
* They die.
* You naive child...
* If you leave the
  RUINS...
* They...
* ASGORE...
* Will kill you.
* I am only protecting
  you, do you understand?
* ... go to your room.
* Do not try to stop me.
* This is your final
  warning.
* Goodbye, my child.
* That is right.
* Go upstairs.
* If you truly wish to
  leave the RUINS...
* I will not stop you.
* However, when you
  leave...
* Please do not come
  back.
* I hope you understand.
* You want to leave
  so badly?
* Hmph.
* You are just like
  the others.
* There is only one
  solution to this.
* Prove yourself...
* Prove to me you
  are strong enough
  to survive.
* Prove to me you
  are strong enough
  to survive!
* ... wait.
* ... why are you looking
  at me like that?
* Like you have seen
  a ghost.
* Do you know something
  that I do not?
* No...
* That is impossible.
* Prove to me that you
  are...
* Hey, let me finish
* Already?
* What will it take
  for you to learn
  your lesson?
* It seems that everyone
  is quite eager to
  set off.
* Frisk...
* You really are a
  funny child.
* If you had said that
  earlier, none of this
  would have happened.
* It is a good thing
  you took so long to
  change your mind.
* Hee hee hee.
* Well...
* I suppose.
* If you really do
  not have any other
  place to go...
* I will do my best to
  take care of you, for
  as long as you need.
* All right?
* Now, come along.
* Everyone is waiting
  for us!
* Ah.
* ... I see.
* Well, I hope that
  I am not keeping
  you.
* "See you around."
  Frisk!
  This is all just
  a bad dream...!
  Please, wake up...!
* Oh!
* You are awake!
* Thank goodness!
* Errr...
* How about we give
  them space, first?
* They must be very
  exhausted.
* Though, from what,
  I am not certain.
* Frisk...
* We do not remember
  exactly what happened.
* There was a flower...
* And then, everything
  went white.
* But now the barrier
  is gone.
* When you are ready,
  we will all return
  to the surface.
* It seems the door to
  the east will lead
  us there now.
* But before then...
* Perhaps you might
  want to take a
  walk?
* You can say goodbye
  to all of your
  wonderful friends.
* Do as you wish.
* We will all wait
  for you here.
* Hello, Frisk.
* Alphys upgraded my
  phone.
* I am having a lot
  of fun with the
  "texting" feature.
* Sans, "check out" this
  one.
* Worry not, Papyrus.
* We are texting for
  a good reason.
* Sans, please do
  not say that.
* You are not a dork.
* You are more of
  a bonehead!
* Frisk, do not feel
  left out.
* I have been writing
  messages to you as
  well!
* You still have my
  phone number after
  all this time...
* Do you not?
* Frisk, how about
  you go look around
  before we all go?
* Seeing how many good
  friends you've made
  here...
* I am almost certain
  you must have made
  some more.
* Sans, did I tell you
  about the time Frisk
  flirted with me...?
* And then asked to
  call me "mother?"
* I felt so embarrassed
  for them.
* Oh, do I ever!
* But, I think that
  story is one of the
  most unbelievable.
* It is hard to think
  anyone would want to
  flirt with me.
* Well, it was not
  RIGHT after.
* It took a couple
  minutes.
* Oh, I should bake it
  for everyone sometime!
* Certainly!
* It would be fun to
  cook together!
* Hmmm... Flying sounds
  a little dangerous.
* Who the hell is Sans?
* Who the HECK is Sans?
What a miserable
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent, youth...
Do not be afraid,
my child.
It is I, TORIEL,
your friend and
guardian.
At first, I thought
I would let you
make your journey
alone...
But I could not
stop worrying about
you.
Your adventure must
have been so
treacherous.
... and ultimately,
it would burden you
with a horrible
choice.
To leave this place,
you would have to
take the life of
another person.
You would have to
defeat ASGORE.
However...
I realized...
I cannot allow that.
It is not right to
sacrifice someone
simply to let
someone leave here.
Is that not what
I have been trying to
prevent this
whole time?
So, for now, let
us suspend this
battle.
As terrible as
ASGORE is...
He deserves mercy,
too.
Do not "Tori" me,
Dreemurr!
You pathetic whelp.
If you really wanted
to free our kind...
You could have gone
through the barrier
after you got ONE
SOUL...
... taken six SOULs
from the humans, then
come back and freed
everyone peacefully.
But instead, you made
everyone live in
despair...
Because you would
rather wait here,
meekly hoping another
human never comes.
(Sigh.)
NO,
Asgore.
Hello.
I am
TORIEL.
Are you
the
human's
friend?
It is
nice to
meet
you.
Oh!
Are you
another
friend?
I am
TORIEL.
Hello!
Hello!
That
voice
...!!
Hello,
I think
we
may...
Know
each
other?
I am
TORIEL.
So nice
to meet
you.
Oh!
Wait,
then...!
This must be your
brother, Papyrus!
Greetings, Papyrus!
It is so nice to
finally meet you!
Your brother has
told me so much
about you.
Hey, Papyrus...
What does a skeleton
tile his roof
with?
No, silly!
A skeleton tiles
his roof with...
SHIN-gles!!!
W-wait!
Not in
front of
the
human!
Hee hee hee.
My child, it seems
as if you must
stay here
for a while.
But looking at
all the great
friends you have
made...
I think...
I think you will
be happy here.
Do not be afraid,
my child...
No matter what
happens...
We will always
be there to
protect you!
Toriel (call)
 
* Hello?
* This is TORIEL.
* For no reason in
  particular...
* Which do you prefer?
* Oh, I see.
* Thank you very much!
   
* Cinnamon or
  butterscotch?
* ... wait.
* Do not tell me.
* Hee hee hee.
* I had a feeling.
* When humans fall down
  here, strangely...
* I...
* I often feel like
  I already know them.
* Truthfully, when I first
  saw you, I felt...
* ... like I was seeing
  an old friend for
  the first time.
* Strange, is it not?
* Well, thank you for
  your selection.
* Oh... I see.
* Well, thank you.
* Goodbye for now.
* This is TORIEL.
* You only wanted to
  say hello...?
* Well then.
* 'Hello!'
* I hope that suffices.
* Hee hee.
* You want to say
  hello again?
* 'Salutations!'
* Is that enough?
  
* Are you bored?
* I should have given
  a book to you.
* My apologies.
* Why not use your
  imagination to
  divert yourself?
* Pretend you are...
* A monarch!
* Rule over the leaf pile
  with a fist of iron.
* Can you do that for me?
* Hello, my child.
* Sorry, I do not have
  much to say.
* It was nice to hear
  your voice, though.
* This is TORIEL.
* Help with a puzzle...?
* Um, you have not
  left the room, have you?
* Wait patiently for
  me and we can solve
  it together!
* You want to know
  more about me?
* Well, I am afraid there
  is not much to say.
* I am just a silly little
  lady who worries too
  much!
* Huh?
* Did you just call
  me... "Mom"?
* Well...
* I suppose...
* Would that make you
  happy?
* To call me...
* "Mother?"
* Well then, call me
  whatever you like!!
* ... huh???
* Oh, heh.. heh...  
* Ha ha ha!
* How adorable... I
  could pinch your cheek!
* You can certainly find
  better than an old woman
  like me.
* Oh dear, are you
  serious...?
* I do not know if this is
  pathetic, or endearing.
* And after you said you
  want to call
  me "mother..."
* You are an... 
  ... "interesting"
  child.
* Hey, you silly
  child.
* If you want to
  talk to me, I am
  right here.
* You can certainly find
  better than an old woman
  like me.
* Hello!
* This is TORIEL.
* My errands are taking
  longer than I thought
  they would.
* You must wait 5 more
  minutes.
* Thank you for being
  patient.
* Hello...
* This is TORIEL.
* I found what I was
  looking for.
* But before I could
  take it...
* A small, white puppy
  snatched it away.
* How odd.
* Do dogs even LIKE
  flour?
* Err, that is an
  unrelated question,
  of course.
* It will take a little
  longer.
* Please understand.
* Stop, please!
* Come back here with my
  CELLPHONE!
* Helloooo?
* Little puppy...?
* Where are you...?
* I will give you a nice pat
  on the head!
* ... if you return my CELLPHONE.
* Here, pup-pup-puppy!
* Oh dear, I should not keep
  my guest waiting any longer.
* ... Oh no, how long has it
  been since I have talked to
  them...?
* Perhaps they have been calling
  the phone, and...?
* ... here, puppy!
* Doggie...
* Here, doggie...
* Oh dear...
* I do wonder how they are...
* You have not left
  the room, have you?
* There are a few puzzles
  ahead that I have
  yet to explain.
* It would be dangerous
  to try to solve them
  yourself.
* Hello? Hello?
* This is TORIEL.
* My apologies.
* A strange dog
  kidnapped my phone.
* So if you called, I
  could not have helped
  you.
* However, I have
  recovered it.
* And you are still in
  that room, are you not?
* What a good child you
  are.
* There are a few puzzles
  ahead that I have
  yet to explain.
* Be good, alright?
* You do not DISLIKE
  butterscotch, do you?
* You do not DISLIKE
  cinnamon, do you?
* I know what your
  preference is, but...
* Would you turn up your
  nose if you found
  it on your plate?
* Right, right, I
  understand.
* Thank you for being
  patient, by the way.
* Hello?
* You do not have
  any allergies, do
  you?
* Huh?
* Why am I asking?
* No reason...
* No reason at all.
* I just realized that it
  has been a while since
  I have cleaned up.
* I was not expecting to
  have company so soon.
* There are probably a lot
  of things lying about
  here and there.
* You can pick them up,
  but do not carry more
  than you need.
* Someday you might see
  something you really
  like.
* You will want to leave
  room in your pockets
  for that.
* I have a question.
* You like things other
  than butterscotch or
  cinnamon, too...
* Do you not?
* ... oh, what am I
  asking.
* I will keep looking.
Toriel (call) and Frisk
* Cinnamon or
  butterscotch?
  Cinnamon    Bscotch 
* It is ERROR MESSAGE!
 
  Yes         No      
* Is it Butterscotch?
 
  Yes         No      
* Is it Cinnamon?
 
  Yes         No

  a friend?"
* "Because she was feeling
  BONELY...
Toriel (message)
* Dear Frisk,
* Sans and Alphys are teaching
  me how to text.
* I am learning so much.
* For example:
* Do you know what a
  "smiley" is?
* Please look at this:
  ]: )
* Now turn your head to the
  left.
* It is a picture of me
  smiling at you!
* Can you see it?
* L-O-L!
* (That stands for Lots of
  Laughter.)
* Sincerely, Toriel
* How are you? You have been
  wandering around for
  quite some time now.
* I hope you are not getting
  into trouble.
* Only kidding.
* L-O-L!
* Sincerly, Toriel
* PS - Do not get into trouble.
* I did not mean to write
  "sincerly."
* I meant to say "sincerely."
* It is difficult to use this
  with large hands.
* Perhaps I should ask Sans
  to transcribe for me.
* I did not say any of that.
* Greetings.
* This is Sans.
* I love my brother very much.
* This is Sans.
* Frisk, did you know that I
  love to "get owned?"
* Excuse me
* .
* Fwd: send this 2 some1 u
  care about... or a skeleton
  will rattle his bones at u
* Thought you might enjoy this.
* ]: )
* Undyne and Papyrus want to
  cook something together
  with me.
* Sans is telling me that they
  are excellent chefs.
* I am excited. ]: )
* Maybe if you are lucky, you
  can have some!
* If Sans and I started a
  band, do you know what
  we could call it?
* "Dreemurr" and "Femur."
* L-O-L!
* PS - That is only a joke.
* Do not refer to me as
  Dreemurr.
* Undyne is very strong.
* Papyrus made a bet with her
  that she could not lift
  everyone here up.
* She could.
* The only trouble is that
  she did not know how to
  put everyone down.
* Alphys is telling me many
  interesting facts about
  the human world.
* Quite a few of them are
  wrong, though.
* Frisk, you did not tell
  her anything funny, did you?
* ]: )
* I heard that using the
  computer for too long
  is bad for you.
* However, I have not seen
  you use the computer at all.
* You must be very healthy!
* How nice.
* I think I may have to turn
  off the phone for now.
* Your friends are all very
  lovely people!
* I think I will spend this
  time getting to know
  them better.
* Be good, alright?
* Sincerely, Toriel.

* Gorey, wake up. 
* Shush!
* I want to get your
  reaction.
* Gorey, dearest.
* What is my favorite
  vegetable?
* No no no!
* My FAVORITE vegetable is...
* Eda-MOM-e.

* No no!!
* Not yet!
* Hee hee hee.
* Now, If I were a dog,
  what breed of dog would

              How to exit
  Yeah        the RUINS

Tsunderplane
It's not
like I
LIKE
you.
Id...
Idiot!
Hmph!
Don't
get in
my way.
>_<...
Human
...
...
H-human
...
...?
Eeeeh?
H-human
...?
Human,
I...
Huh!?
Y-you
sicko!
Ah...
Is that
true...?
No way!
Why
would I
like YOU
B-but I
never
got to
...!
* Hey!
* Watch where you stand,
  jerk!
* Th-though, I guess if
  there's nowhere else, you
  can stand closer...
* Standing so spicey.
* A-ah... H-human...
* You're leaving?
* I have...
* Something to say to you.
* Admittedly, I may have had
  limerent feelings for you
  before.
* However, upon examining my
  own actions, I now
  realize...
* I did not love YOU.
* I was merely infatuated
  with the CONCEPT of love.
* The idea of romance, the
  concept of sharing affection
  with another...
* Through these desires, I
  built a false concept of
  you in my head.
* Such a relationship would
  not have ended well.
* In closing, I believe it
  is better that I chose to
  say nothing.
* Y... y-you i-idiot.
* I'm not saying it again.
* H-hey, why do you keep
  following me!!!
* You jerk!!!
* Eeeeh?
* You're walking in the
  opposite direction...?
* H-hey, you think you're too
  good for me, huh...?
* N-not spicey enough for you,
  h-huh...
* I... I'm thinking of going
  to the surface...
* Eeeeeh?
* You're going to go there
  too?
* Idiot...
* Quit following me!
Ugly Fish
* I "put out a line" for some
  girls today.
* Someone told me that there
  are plenty of fish in the
  sea...
* Well, I'm taking that
  seriously.
* I'm literally going to make
  out with a fish.
* I guess I could ask out Undyne.
* But I think she likes someone
  already.
* Did I catch anyone yet?
* I can't bear to look...
* Sans is the most regular
  regular of all.
* He hasn't been showing up
  as much recently though.
* Where the heck is Sans?
* He told me he had some
  bait I could use.
* Though it was probably
  some kind of prank.
* But I wanted to know what
  the prank was!
* In the end, I never caught
  any girls on my fishing
  line.
* So kid, take it from me...
* Don't try to catch hot
  people with a fishing rod.
* Hey Sans, weren't you just
  here for breakfast a
  few minutes ago?
Ugly Fish (note)
* (Call Me!
  Here's my number!)
* (Nevermind, guys!)
Undyne
* Seven.
* Seven human souls.
* With the power of seven
  human souls, our king...
* King ASGORE Dreemurr...
* ... will become a god.
* With that power, ASGORE 
  can finally shatter the
  barrier.
* He will finally take the
  surface back from humanity...
* And give them back the
  suffering and pain that
  we have endured.
* Understand, human?
* This is your only chance
  at redemption.
* Give up your soul...
* Or I'll tear it from
  your body.
* That spark in your eyes...
* You're really eager to
  die, aren't you?
* ...
* So why are YOU
  here?
* To rub your victory
  in my face?
* To humiliate me
  even further?
* Oh-ho-ho-ho.
* Well, I've got news
  for you, BRAT.
* You're on MY
  battlefield now.
* And you AREN'T
  going to
  humiliate me.
* I'll TELL you
  what's going to
  happen.
* We're going to
  hang out.
* We're going to
  have a good
  time.
* We're going to
  become "friends."
* You'll become so
  enamored with me...
* YOU'LL be the one
  feeling humiliated
  for your actions!
* Fuhuhuhuhu!!
* It's the perfect
  revenge!!!
* Err...
* Why don't you
  have a seat?
* Then why are you
  here?
* ...!
* Wait, I get it.
* You think that I'm
  gonna be friends
  with you, huh?
* Really?
* How delightful!!
* I accept!
* Let's all frolick
  in the fields
  of friendship!
* ...NOT!
* Why would I EVER
  be friends with
  YOU!?
* If you weren't my
  houseguest, I'd beat
  you up right now!
* You're the enemy
  of everyone's hopes
  and dreams!
* I WILL NEVER
  BE YOUR FRIEND.
* Now get out of
  my house!
* WHAT?
* First you parade
  into my house,
  then you INSULT me?
* You little BRAT!
* I have half a
  mind to...
* Wait.
* I'll prove you
  WRONG.
* We ARE going to
  be friends.
* In fact...
* We.
* Are going to be
  BESTIES.
* I'll make you like
  me so much...
* Your WHOLE LIFE
  will revolve around
  me!!
* FUHUHUHUHU!!!
* Now, why don't
  you have a seat?
* That sugar's for
  the tea.
* I'm not gonna give
  you a cup of
  sugar!
* What do I look
  like, the ice-cream
  woman?
* Do human ice-cream
  women TERRORIZE HUMANITY
  with ENERGY SPEARS?
* Are their ice-cream
  songs a PRELUDE TO
  DESTRUCTION?
* ... what?
* REALLY?
* That rules!!!
* That's what I
  thought.
* Envision these
  vegetables as your
  greatest enemy!
* Now!!
* Pound them to dust
  with your fists!!
* YEAH!
* YEAH!
* Our hearts are
  uniting against these
  healthy ingredients!
* NOW IT'S MY TURN!
* NGAHHH!
* OH MY GOD!!!
* STOP PETTING THE
  ENEMY!!!
* I'll show you
  how it's done!
* ... we add the
  noodles!
* Homemade noodles
  are the best!
* BUT I JUST BUY
  STORE-BRAND!
* THEY'RE THE
  CHEAPEST!!!
* NGAHHHHHHHHH
  HHHHHHHHHH!!!
* Uhh, just put them
  in the pot.
* YEAH!!!
* I'M INTO IT!!!
* Nice???
* Humans suck, but
  their history...
* Kinda rules.
* Case in point:
* This giant sword!
* Historically, humans
  wielded swords up
  to 10x their size.
* Heh, I knew it!
* When I first heard
  that, I immediately
  wanted one!
* So me and Alphys
  built a giant
  sword together.
* She figured out all
  the specs herself...
* She's smart, huh!?
* Pfft!
* You liar!
* I've READ Alphys's
  human history book
  collection!
* I know all about
  your giant swords...
* Your colossal,
  alien-fighting
  robots...
* Your supernatural
  princesses...
* Heh! There's no
  way you're gonna
  fool me!!!
* So, Alphys...
* What do you want
  to do now that
  we're all free?
* We have the whole
  world to explore
  now.
* Heh.
* Papyrus has the
  right idea.
* Losing to Frisk is
  the best thing to
  ever happen to me.
* So I'm glad that
  we...
* Huh?
* What is it, Asgore?
* ... kissing?
* Frisk! Stop!
* You're breaking his
  big burly heart!
* ASGORE! STOP!
* YOU'RE BREAKING MY
  BIG BURLY HEART!
* OH MY GOD!
* YOU'RE GOING BACK
  IN THE TRASH!!!
* Sure, Papyrus.
* Uh, okay?
* SURE!!!
* WHY NOT!!!
* OH MY GOD!!!
* Frisk, you LIVE with
  this!?
* The sunlight is so
  nice... and the air
  is so fresh!
* I really feel alive!
Get your OWN name!
* OH MY GOD!!!
* I'M GONNA FREAKIN' KILL
  YOU!!
   
 Hey!!
 There you are!!
 I, uh, realized,
 if you deliver that
  thing...
 It might be a bad
 idea.
 So I'm gonna do
 it!!!
 Give it to me!!!
 Huh!?
 You don't have it!?
 Ngggaaahhh!!
 Have you at least
 seen her!?
 Yes?
 So she's somewhere
 around here...
 Thanks.
 I'll keep looking.
 No???
 But she wasn't
 at home...
 Where the heck
 could she be!?
WHAT did you just
say?
Hey, woah, wait
a second!
Your outfit's really
cute!
What's the occasion?
...
Wait a second.
Are you two...
On a date?
WHAT???
WHAT???
ABOUT WHAT???
Alphys.
Alphys.
Shhhh.
Shhhhhh.
Alphys!
I... think you're
neat, too, I guess.
But, you've gotta
realize...
Most of what you
said really doesn't
matter to me.
I don't care if
you're watching kid
cartoons or reading
history books.
To me, ALL of
that stuff is
just NERDY CRAP!
What I like about
you is that you're
PASSIONATE!
You're ANALYTICAL!!
It doesn't matter
what it is!
YOU CARE ABOUT IT!!
100-PERCENT!!
AT MAXIMUM POWER!!!
... so, you don't
have to lie to me.
I don't want you
to have to lie to
anyone anymore.
Alphys... I want to
help you become
happy with who
you are!
And I know just
the training you
need to do that!
Pffft, what?
ME?
Nah, I'm gonna
get Papyrus to
do it.
Ready?
I'm about to start
the timer!
OH MY GOD!!!
She was kidding,
right!? 
Those cartoons...
those comics...
Those are still
REAL, right!?
ANIME'S REAL,
RIGHT?!?!
HA HA HA!!!
I KNEW IT!!!
GIGANTIC SWORDS!!!
MAGICAL PRINCESSES!
HERE I COME!!!
No... NO!!!!
I CAN FEEL MY
HEART BREAKING
INTO PIECES!!!
...
Uhh, thanks for
taking care of
Alphys.
I didn't get to
say what I wanted
to, but...
Things seem like
they're going to get
better for her.
Well, I gotta go
catch up with
them!
Later!
...
... no, I can
survive this...
I have to be strong.
For Alphys.
Thank you, human,
for telling me
the truth.
I'll try my best to
live in this
world...
See you later!
Ngahhh!
Bring
it on!
C'mon!
Fuhuhu!
Ngahh!!
Urahhh!!
  You're strong...
  But not strong
  enough!
  You're a pain in
  the neck, huh?
  DIE ALREADY, YOU
  LITTLE BRAT!
  As long as you're
  GREEN you CAN'T
  ESCAPE!
  Unless you learn
  to face danger
  head-on...
  You won't last
  a SECOND against
  ME!
  You?
  Sparing ME?
  Fuhuhuhu!
  How insulting!
  I'd NEVER
  surrender to the
  likes of you!
  Not bad!
  Then how about
  THIS!?
  I wanted this to
  be a fair fight.
  I thought if I
  beat you like
  this...
  It'd truly show
  how strong
  monsters can be.
  BUT NOW???
  I DON'T CARE!
  I'M NOT YOUR
  FREAKING
  KINDERGARTEN
  TEACHER!
  Unless your
  kindergarten
  teacher...
  DOES THIS!
  WHAT ARE YOU
  DOING?
  JUST FACE
  UPWARDS!!!
  IT'S NOT HARD!
 
  Look.
  I gave you a
  spear to block
  the bullets with.
  Do I have to
  explain this
  any more
  clearly?
  When I said
  face towards
  danger...
  I meant face
  towards the
  bullets!
  For years,
  we've dreamed
  of a happy
  ending...
  And now,
  sunlight is
  just within
  our reach!
  I won't let
  you snatch it
  away from
  us!
  NGAHHH!
  Enough warming
  up!
  Heh...
  You're tough!
  Mercy!
  Ha!
  I still can't
  believe YOU
  want to spare
  ME!
  But even if
  you could
  beat me...
  But even if
  I spared
  YOU...
  No human has
  EVER made it
  past
  ASGORE!
  Honestly,
  killing you
  now is an act
  of mercy...!
  Honestly, I'm
  doing you
  a favor...
  Killing you
  now is an act
  of mercy!
  So STOP being
  so damn
  resilient!
  What the
  hell are
  humans made
  out of!?
  Anyone else
  would be DEAD
  by now!
  Alphys told me
  humans were
  determined...
  I see now what
  she meant by
  that!
  But I'm
  determined,
  too!
  Determined to
  end this
  RIGHT NOW!
  ... RIGHT NOW!
  ... RIGHT...
  ...
  ... NOW!!
  Ha...
  Ha...
  NGAHHH!!!
  DIE ALREADY, YOU
  LITTLE BRAT!
  YOU'RE GETTING
  IN MY WAY!
  I WILL NEVER
  TAKE MERCY FROM
  THE LIKES OF YOU!
  I WILL NOT
  BE DEFEATED!
  YOU! WILL!
  NEVER! SPARE! ME!
  Come on, is that
  all you've got!?
  ... pathetic.
  You're going to
  have to try
  harder than that!
  S-see how strong
  we are when we
  believe in
  ourselves?
  H... heh...
  Had enough yet?
  ...
  ... I won't...
  ... give up...
...
En guarde!
  You won't get
  away from me
  this time!
  You've escaped
  from me for
  the LAST time!
  STOP RUNNING
  AWAY!!!
  COME BACK HERE,
  YOU LITTLE
  PUNK!!
Ngahhh...
You were stronger...
Than I thought...
So then...
... this is where...
... it ends...
  No...
NO!
I won't die!
Alphys...
Asgore...
Papyrus...
Everyone is counting
on me to protect
them!
NNNNGAH!
Human!
In the name of
everybody's hopes
and dreams...
I WILL DEFEAT YOU!
Ha... ha...
... Alphys...
This is what I
  was afraid of...
This is why I
  never told you...
No...
No!
Not yet!
I won't die!
NGAHHHHHHHH!!! 
 I WON'T DIE! 
 I WON'T 
Show me what
you've got!
Do your worst!
What's the
matter, scared?
What the hell
is the holdup?
COME ON ALREADY!
IT'S GETTING
HOT IN HERE!
I've been
defeated...
My house is in
shambles...
I even failed to
befriend you.
That's it.
I don't care if
you're my guest
anymore.
One final rematch!
All out on both
sides!!!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN REGAIN MY
LOST PRIDE!!!
NOW COME ON!
HIT ME WITH
ALL YOU'VE GOT!
NGAHHHH!!!
What.
That's the best
you can manage?
Even attacking at
full force...
You just can't
muster any intent
to hurt me,
huh?
Heh, you know
what?
I don't actually
want to hurt you
either.
At first, I hated
your stupid
saccharine
schtick, but...
The way you hit
me right now,
it...
Reminded me of
someone I used
to train with.
Now I know you
aren't just some
wimpy loser.
You're a wimpy
loser with a
big heart!
Just like him...
Listen, human.
It seems that you
and ASGORE are
fated to fight.
But knowing him...
He probably
doesn't want to.
Talk to him.
I'm sure you can
persuade him to
let you go home.
Eventually, some
mean human will
fall down here...
And I'll take
THEIR soul instead.
That makes sense,
right?
Fuhuhu.
Oh, and if you
DO hurt ASGORE...
I'll take the
human souls...
Cross the barrier...
And beat the
hell out of you!
That's what friends
are for, right?
Fuhuhu!
Now let's get the
hell out of this
flaming house!
Hurt?
It's nothing.
Next time, listen
when I tell you
to leave, okay?
I'll take care of
this!
Get out of here!
... heh...
"It's nothing"...
No... s-somehow,
with just one
hit...
I'm already...
Already...
D... damn it....
Papyrus...
Alphys...
ASGORE...
Just like that,
I...
I've failed you.
No...
My body...
It feels like it's
splitting apart.
Like any instant...
I'll scatter into
a million pieces.
But...
Deep, deep in my
soul.
There's a burning
feeling I can't
describe.
A burning feeling
that WON'T let me
die.
This isn't just
about monsters
anymore, is it?
If you get past
me, you'll...
You'll destroy them
all, won't you?
Monsters...
Humans...
Everyone...
Everyone's hopes.
Everyone's dreams.
Vanquished in an
instant.
But I WON'T let
you do that.
Right now, everyone
in the world...
I can feel their
hearts beating as
one.
And we all have
ONE goal.
To defeat YOU.
Human.
No, WHATEVER you
are.
For the sake of
the whole world...
I, UNDYNE, will
strike you down!
All
humans
will
die!
You're
our
real
enemy.
Mercy
is for
the
weak.
Well, some humans
are OK, I guess!
* Stir harder!
* HARDER!
* HARDER!!!!
* Ugh, let me do it!
* Left? You fool!
* THIS BURNER ONLY
  GOES ONE WAY!!!
* Hotter!
* HOTTER, DARNIT!
* HOTTER!!!!!!!
* Wait, that's too - 
* See!?
* This is how you -
* ... are you...
* Hitting on me????
* ????????????????
* The sugar is for
  tea, mmm'kay?
* Oh, soda?
* Actually, even though
  you pointed to it,
  you don't look happy.
* Heh, that's fine!
* I think soda's gross,
  too!
* It rots your teeth...
* It rots your mind...
* IT ROTS YOUR FIGHTING
  SPIRIT!
* ... huh?
* Why do I have it?
* ...
* What?
* You wanna throw the
  spear at it?
* Oh, you want some
  hot chocolate?
* Wait, wait, I just
  remembered...
* That container's empty.
* I stopped getting
  it because it was
  always a hassle...
* ASGORE kept getting
  marshmallows stuck in
  his beard.
* That container's empty.
* ... tea, huh?
* Coming right up!
* The fridge!?
* You want to have
  the entire fridge!?
* No!
* Believe me, I would
  GLADLY give you your
  fill of swords.
* If you weren't my
  beloved houseguest!
* Uhhh... thanks.
* I'll, uh, put it
  with the others.
* So are we ready
  to start?
* CHALLENGE!?
* What!?
* Papyrus!
* Wait a second...!
* Darnit!
* He thinks I can't
  be friends with
  YOU!?
* Fuhuhu!
* What a joke!
* I could make friends
  with a wimpy loser
  like you any day!
* I'll show him!
* Listen up, human.
* We're not just
  going to be
  friends.
* We're going to
  be...
* BESTIES.
* I'll make you
  like me so much...
* You won't be able
  to think of anyone
  else!!!
* Fuhuhuhu!
* It's the PERFECT
  REVENGE!!
* Oh, leaving so soon?
* No.
* No you're not.
* Comfortable?
* I'll get you
  something to drink.
* All set!
* What would you like?
* HEY!!!
* DON'T GET UP!!!
* YOU'RE THE GUEST!!
* SIT DOWN AND ENJOY
  YOURSELF!!!
* Um, why not just
  point to what you
  want?
* You can use the
  spear!
* Y'know, I was a
  pretty hotheaded
  kid.
* Once, to prove I was
  the strongest, I tried
  to fight ASGORE.
* Emphasis on TRIED.
* I couldn't land
  a single blow
  on him!
* And worse, the whole
  time, he refused
  to fight back!
* I was so
  humiliated...
* Afterwards, he
  apologized and said
  something goofy...
* "Excuse me, do you
  want to know how
  to beat me?"
* I said yes, and
  from then on, he
  trained me.
* One day, during
  practice, I finally
  knocked him down.
* I felt... bad.
* But he was
  beaming...
* I had never seen
  someone more proud to
  get their butt kicked.
* ... oh!
* I almost forgot
  about your tea!
* Just a moment!
* Wait a second.
* Papyrus...
* His cooking lesson...
* HE WAS SUPPOSED
  TO HAVE THAT RIGHT
  NOW!!!
* And if HE's not
  here to have it...
* YOU'LL HAVE TO
  HAVE IT FOR HIM!!!
* That's right!!!
* NOTHING has brought
  Papyrus and I
  closer than cooking!
* Which means that if
  I give you his
  lesson...
* WE'LL BECOME CLOSER
  THAN YOU CAN
  EVER IMAGINE!!!
* Fuhuhu!!! Afraid!?
* We're gonna be best
  friends!!!
* Ready!?
* It's spaghetti time!
* Let's start with the
  sauce!!
* Uhh, we'll just scrape
  this into a bowl
  later.
* But for NOW!
* Alright!
* Now it's time
  to stir the pasta!
* As a general rule
  of thumb, the more
  you stir...
* THE BETTER IT IS!
* Ready?
* Let's do it!
* Fuhuhuhu!
* That's the stuff!
* Alright, now for
  the final step:
* TURN UP THE HEAT!
* Let the stovetop
  symbolize your
  passion!
* Let your hopes and
  dreams turn into
  burning fire!
* READY?
* Don't hold anything
  back!!!
* Ah.
* Man, no wonder
  Papyrus sucks at
  cooking.
* So what's next?
* Scrapbooking?
* Friendship bracelets?
* ... oh, who am I
  kidding.
* I really screwed this
  up, didn't I?
* I can't force you to
  like me, human.
* Some people just
  don't get along
  with each other.
* I understand if
  you feel that
  way about me.
* And if we can't
  be friends...
* That's okay.
* Because...
* If we're not
  friends...
* IT MEANS I CAN
  DESTROY YOU WITHOUT
  REGRET!
* It'll take a moment
  for the water to
  boil.
* Okay, it's all
  done!
* Here we are.
* Careful, it's hot.
* It's not THAT hot!!
* Just drink it already!
* It's pretty good,
  right?
* Nothing but the best
  for my ABSOLUTELY
  PRECIOUS FRIEND!!
* Hey...
* You know...
* It's kind of strange
  you chose THAT tea.
* Golden flower tea...
* That's ASGORE's
  favorite kind.
* Actually, now that
  I think about it...
* You kind of remind
  me of him.
* You're both TOTAL
  weenies!!!
* ... sort of.
* Anyway, long story
  short, he kept training
  me...
* And now I'm the
  head of the Royal
  Guard!
* So I'm the one
  who gets to train
  dorks to fight!
* ... like, uh, Papyrus.
* But, um, to be
  honest...
*... I don't know if...
* I can ever let
  Papyrus into the
  Royal Guard.
* Don't tell him I
  said that!
* He's just...
* Well...
* I mean, it's not
  that he's weak.
* He's actually
  pretty freaking
  tough!
* It's just that...
* He's...
* He's too innocent
  and nice!!!
* I mean, look, he
  was SUPPOSED to
  capture you...
* And he ended up
  being FRIENDS with
  you instead!
* I could NEVER send
  him into battle!
* He'd get ripped
  into little smiling
  shreds.
* That's part of why...
* I started teaching
  him how to cook,
  you know?
* So, um, maybe he
  can do something
  else with his life.
* Oh, sorry, I was
  talking for so
  long...
* You're out of tea,
  aren't you?
* I'll get you some
  more.
* Hi, Papyrus!
* Ready for your extra-
  private, one-on-one
  training?
* Hi, I don't think
  we've...
* ...
* Why don't.
* You two.
* Come in?
* Well, that was
  fun, huh?
* We'll have to hang
  out again another
  time...!
* But, uh, somewhere
  else I guess.
* In the meantime,
  I guess I'll go
  hang with Papyrus.
* So if you need
  me, drop by Snowdin,
  OK!?
* OH!
* And if you ever
  need help...
* Just give Papyrus a
  ring, ok?
* Since we're in the
  same spot, I'll be
  able to talk too!
* Well, see ya
  later, punk!!
* Well, see ya
  later, punk...
* OH!!!
* WAIT!!
* This is sudden, but...
* Can you deliver
  something for me?
* Papyrus suggested
  that I ask you.
* But he told me when
  I still hated you,
  so...
* Uh! Anyway!!!
* Here! Just take it!
* Well, what are you
  waiting for!?
* Go deliver it!!!
* Uhhhh...
* Oh, yeah...
* It's addressed to
  Dr. Alphys.
* OK, see you!!
* Can you...
* Hey, wait!
* Your inventory's
  full.
* Uh, well, I'll be
  at Papyrus's.
* Come see me when
  you have less
  stuff!
* That's it, then...!
* No more running away!
* I KNEW you would
  come back here!
* HERE I COME!!!!!!!
* Seven human souls, and
  King ASGORE will become
  a god.
* Six.
* That's how many we have
  collected thus far.
* Understand?
* Through your seventh and
  final soul, this world will
  be transformed.
* First, however, as is customary
  for those who make it this
  far...
* I shall tell you the tragic
  tale of our people.
* It all started, long ago...
* No, you know what?
* SCREW IT!
* WHY SHOULD I TELL THAT STORY 
* WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE!?! 
* NGAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
* YOU!
* You're standing in
  the way of everybody's
  hopes and dreams!
* Alphys's history books
  made me think
  humans were cool...
* ... with their giant
  robots and flowery
  swordswomen.
* BUT YOU?
* You're just a coward!
* Hiding behind that kid
  so you could run away
  from me again!
* You abandoned your
  friend just so you
  could run away!
* And let's not forget
  your wimpy goody-two-
  shoes-schtick!
* Oooh! I'm making such a
  difference by hugging
  random strangers!
* You know what would
  be more valuable
  to everyone?
* IF YOU WERE DEAD!!!
* That's right, human!
* Your continued
  existence is a crime!
* Your life is all
  that stands between
  us and our freedom!
* Right now, I can
  feel everyone's hearts
  pounding together!
* Everyone's been
  waiting their whole
  lives for this moment!
* But we're not
  nervous at all.
* When everyone puts
  their hearts together,
  they can't lose!
* Now, human!
* Let's end this,
  right here, right now.
* I'll show you how
  determined monsters
  can be!
* Step forward when
  you're ready!
* Fuhuhuhu!
* And! And!
*... and something's
  been bothering me,
  too.
* The whole time I was
  chasing after you...
* I felt something...
* Strange.
* The echoes of something
  warm, something...
* Something like "I miss
  being friends with you."
* BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
I WOULD NEVER GET
  CHUMMY WITH A COWARD
  LIKE YOU!
* You!
* You must have been
  mind-controlling me!
* Manipulating people to
  make them like you...
* What a Grade-A FREAK!
* Now enough!
* For everyone's hopes!
* For everyone's dreams!
* And for my own
  freaking dignity!
* I, UNDYNE, will
  knock you down!
* Alphys's history books
  made me think humans
  were compassionate...
* You're just a
  remorseless criminal!
* You wander through the
  caverns, attacking
  anyone in your path.
* Self-defense?
* Please.
* You didn't kill them
  because you had to.
* You killed them
  because it was
  easy for you.
* Because it was fun
  for you.
* Do you think it
  was fun when I
  found out...?
* Do you think it's
  fun when people's
  family members...
* ... never come home?
* Is that fun?
* Shyren, who was
  just learning to
  sing...
* ... was dead, because
  of the whims of
  a single human?
* A teenage comedian
  who fell in with
  the wrong crowd...
* Doggo, who always
  made me laugh...
* Those two sweet dogs,
  who always took care
  of each other...
* ... were dead, because
  of the whims of
  a single human?
* That big dog, who
  wanted nothing more
  than to play...
* Lesser Dog, who
  wanted nothing more
  than affection...
* The Snowdin Canine
  Unit had been
  completely decimated.
* My troops and friends,
  destroyed...
* Is that fun?
* No.
* But your time's up,
  villain!
* You won't hurt anyone
  else.
* A knight in shining
  armor has appeared.
* And all the pain
  you inflicted on
  the fallen...
* Every hope, every
  dream you've turned
  to dust...
* She's gonna send
  right back through
  her spear!
* NGAHHH!!!
* I'll show you how
  determined monsters
  truly are!
* Come on!
* Step forward and
  let's end this!
* Forget it.
* Look.
* Papyrus didn't come
  to his meeting
  today.
* Say what you want
  about him.
* He's weird, he's
  naive, he's self-
  absorbed...
* But Papyrus has
  NEVER missed a
  meeting.
* And no matter what
  time you call him
  on the phone...
* Night, day, afternoon,
  morning...
* He ALWAYS answers
  within the first
  two rings.
* But now he's gone.
* And his brother
  isn't around,
  either.
* ...
* What did you do
  to him?
* What did you DO
  TO HIM?
* Papyrus, who I have
  trained every day...
* Even though I KNOW
  he's too goofy to
  ever hurt anyone...
* Go ahead.
* Prepare however you
  want.
* But when you step
  forward...
* I will KILL you.
* Armor... so... hot...
* But I can't...
* Give up...
* Man, do I have
  to do EVERYTHING?
* Papyrus, wait!!!
* Yeah! Any longer and
  I would have freaked
  out!
* Tell us next time
  you decide to take
  a nap, okay!?
* Papyrus, we've been
  over this.
* Don't talk back to
  me like that!
* Go to your room,
  Papyrus!
* Wait!
* Don't ACTUALLY go
  to your room!!
* Wait a second!!!
* Can I help too!?
* Hey, punk!
* What's up!?
* Papyrus, how can you
  stand this cold?
* So why don't we
  stand in Grillby's
  instead?
* But you don't have
  a stomach!!
* Papyrus...
* Why do you live
  in an icy wasteland?
* Really?
* Don't you live in
  a huge house?
* Where's your brother
  get the money to
  pay for it...?
* So? What are you
  waiting for?
* The sooner you get
  it over with, the
  better!
* Hey, you sure
  are carrying a
  lot of things.
* If someone needed
  to give you a thing,
  they sure couldn't!
* What?
* You LOST the letter!?
* What the HECK!?
* How!? Why!?
* Ughhh...
* This is unbelievable.
* I should be really
  disappointed in you.
* But, uh, to tell
  you the truth, I'm
  kind of relieved!
* While you were gone,
  I actually wrote
  a WAY BETTER letter!
* And this time, you
  WON'T lose it!!!
* I guarantee it!!!
* Hey, I have something
  to give you...
* But you're carrying
  way too much!!!
* Um, so, I have a
  favor to ask you.
* Uuuuh, I...
* I need you to deliver
  this letter.
* To Dr. Alphys.
* Huh!?
* Why don't I do it
  myself...?
* ... um.
* W-well...
* I-it's kind of
  personal, but we're
  friends... so...
* I'll t-tell you...
* Hotland SUUUUCKS!!!
* I don't wanna have
  to go over there!!!
* So here you go.
* Oh, and if you
  read it...
* I'll KILL you.
* Thanks so much!
* You're the best!!
* Hey, Alphys!
* Alphys!
* Do you think we
  can watch something
  with fighting next?
* Oh, and then...
* Something...
* With princesses!?
* Or FIGHTING
  princesses!?
* Yayyyyy!
* Hey Frisk, why don't
  you go say hi to
  Napstablook?
* Oh, tell them I
  said hi, too!
* Not with THAT
  attitude!
* Oh man!!!
* We're gonna be
  able to watch
  anime online!?
* Hey, don't worry
  about it, ASGORE.
* I think everybody's
  tried to kill Frisk
  at least once.
* ASGORE!
* That's not what I
  meant!
* I hate cold food.
* So Alphys fixed up
  my fridge so it
  heats up food instead!
* Hot Fridge...
* The world's greatest
  invention!
* This oven is some
  top-of-the-line
  MTT thing.
* But, y'know, as much
  as technology
  advances...
* Nothing beats food
  home-cooked with
  fire magic.
* You wanna see my
  room?
* TOO BAD!
* No nerds allowed!
* ... well, maybe some
  nerds...
* You're being kind
  of creepy.
* I love how, um,
  thoughtful Papyrus
  is...
* But what the hell
  am I supposed to do
  with all these bones?
* Do you call it
  your COOLSHED!?
* That's the only
  one I've ever
  made, dude.
* Oh my GOD, I don't
  even wanna KNOW.
* What, lemme guess.
* Sometimes you cut a
  hot dog into the
  dog food, right?
* OH MY GOD! NO!
* I WAS JOKING!!!
* DON'T DO THIS!!!
* One time, Alphys's...
* Uh, friend???
* Came over here.
* All he did was
  lie seductively
  on the piano...
* And fed himself
  grapes.
* I don't really
  like that guy.
* But I admire
  his lifestyle.
* What?
* I'm not gonna
  serenade you.
* I can't believe he
  leapt through the
  window like that.
* Normally he NAILS
  the landing.
* It's so nice to
  have you over!
* Why not take a
  seat at the
  table?
* Sit at the freakin'
  table, you little
  nerd.
* Oh my god!
* The letter's not
  to PAPYRUS!!!
* Fine, you want a
  letter!?
* I'll give you a
  letter!!!
* YOU GET AN "F"!
* Friendship!!!
* Hey, shrimp!
* You look like you get your
  butt kicked a lot!
* Why don't you check out
  my new book on fighting
  in the library?
* That is...
* If you're tough enough to
  love reading books!
* GROWL!!
* Hey! Don't throw that
  away! Just deliver it!
Ngahhhhhh!!!
ASGORE! Human!!
Nobody fight each
other!!!
Everyone's gonna
make friends, or
else I'll...!!
I'll...
Uh,
yeah...?
Nice to
meet
you!
Hey
ASGORE,
is that
your ex?
Jeez.
That's
rough,
buddy.
Come on, ASGORE!
It's gonna be OK!
There are plenty
of fish in the
sea...
Well.
I think
it's a
good
analogy.
HEY, SHUT UP!!!
Man, the nerve of
that guy!
Right,
Alphys!??
Uh, Alphys?
??????????????
Well??? Uh???
I guess???
If you want to???
Then????
Don't hold anything
back!!!
Hey! Human! If
you got past
ME, you can
do ANYTHING!
So don't worry!
We're with you
all the way!
Undyne (call)
* Hey, I know!
* Alphys told me...
* It goes to Hotland
  to cool down the
  CORE!
* Are you kidding!?
* Why wouldn't I!?
* The brain's the
  biggest muscle of
  all!!!
* Hey, I always stay
  there when I come
  to Snowdin!
* I used to stay
  at Papyrus's, but...
* His couch is like,
  lumpy and jangly?
* And his brother
  kept making 100's
  of midnight snacks.
* And Papyrus himself
  doesn't???
* Know how to sleep?
* Yeah, just sleep
  here.
* WOAH, if you go,
  you HAVE to try
  the cheese fries.
* They're AMAZINGLY
  bad for you!!
* Oh, sorry, Papyrus,
  were you saying
  something?
* Grease, I...
* I...
* ...
* I want you in
  all my food!!!
* I couldn't get enough
  books when I was
  a kid.
* I tore through all
  sorts of 'em!
* I ripped through
  tons of 'em!
* I kicked 'em into
  shreds!!!
* But now I think
  reading's cool.
* Yeah!! This is the
  best room for
  snow-wrestling!!
* Well, you know
  what I think?
* Snow-wrestling!!
* We'll have to play
  sometime!
* If you're going to
  Snowdin, I won't
  have much to say.
* There's the rub,
  right?
* In Snowdin, duh!!!
* Hey, I think I
  found something!
* It's the rub!!!
* This is Papyrus's
  brother's station.
* I'm always catching
  him slacking off,
  or sleeping...
* But his results are
  JUST good enough
  to not fire him.
* Well, except today.
* He didn't tell me
  ANYTHING about you.
* JUST scraping by
  the bare minimum
  every time...
* I guess it's kind
  of impressive...?
* God, I was supposed
  to build a puzzle
  for this room...
* But I HATE puzzles.
* So I just put a
  huge pile of
  rocks upstream.
* What???
* Don't judge me!!!
* My lack of
  creativity's making
  your life easier!
* So you found the
  room behind the
  waterfall...
* When I feel like
  relaxing, I always
  take a break there.
* That means NEVER!!
* I HATE RELAXING!!
* I LOVE being
  ANGRY and STRESSED
  OUT!!!
* Nah, I'm joking.
* This is the room
  where I first
  spotted you.
* You have NO idea
  how many spears I
  wanted to throw!!!
* But, um, that sea-
  grass is under
  scientific protection.
* What!!!!!
* That's a real thing!
* Wait, did you actually
  DO the puzzle!?
* You can't just jump
  across!?
* You can't do the
  jimpity jumpity
  joodle!?
* The limpity loppity
  leap!?
* Alphys helped measure
  out the mud tiles
  for this puzzle.
* It was a lot of work,
  but we got to make
  sand castles after.
* We're a good team.
* She's great at
  building them...
* And I'm great at
  wrecking them!!
* There's barely even
  a trace of 'em
  now...
* What's better than
  a benchful of
  quiche?
* Every day, people
  come here and wish
  to the stars...
* I won't let them
  down!!!
* I'll make everyone's
  wishes come true!!
* I'll make most
  people's wishes
  come true!!!
* What, you have a
  wish?
* Add it to the pile,
  punk.
* Along these walls
  lies our tragic
  history...
* Tragically BORING!
* Why can't our history
  be COOL ANIMATIONS
  like the humans'!?
* Someone at LEAST
  engrave a plaque with
  swords and kissing!!!
* Come on, don't act
  like your history's
  not COOL!!
* This is where I
  threw all those
  spears at you...
* That was fun!!!
* Let's do that
  again sometime!!
* Come on!
* Don't fear the spear!
* If it wasn't for
  that grass, I'd
  have kicked your...
* Uh, if not for
  that grooty, I'd have
  kicked your booty.
* Don't ask me what
  a grooty is!!!
* Where are all
  these tables coming
  from?
* Hey, here's a
  neat party trick.
* Try talking to
  the southern
  wall!
* First you have to
  throw a party
  though...
* Hey, you should
  make it a costume
  party!
* Then Papyrus can
  have someplace he
  seems normal!!!
* Oh!
* I should invite
  Alphys, too!
* Ugh, ice cream!?
* Sugary... COLD...
* Talk about GROSS.
* Now this chilly
  pink stuff that
  Alphys makes me...
* THAT rules!!!
* I'll also drink it
  if it's heated up.
* There's normally a
  pair of old shoes
  in that seagrass.
* Strangely, they're made
  for someone without
  fins or claws.
* What kind of monster
  is like that...?
* Oh, wait!?
* What about a slime
  monster!?
* Wait, those don't
  have feet at all!
* Well, if they fit
  you, you might as
  well take them.
* Whoever wore them
  isn't coming back!
* That bird will carry
  anyone past the gap.
* It NEVER says no.
* When I was younger,
  it gave me a lift.
* It took an hour...
* But this bird NEVER
  once thought of
  giving up!!!
* Cherish this bird.
* Well???
* Are you CHERISHING???
* CHERISH HARDER!!!
* Onion...?
* ...?
* Oh yeah, Shyren
  lives around here.
* I used to give her
  piano lessons.
* She was really
  talented... for someone
  with no fingers.
* One day, she stopped
  coming to her lessons,
  though...
* How did her song
  go again...?
* Yeah!! YEAH!!!
* I made this puzzle!!
* Really, it was just
  an excuse to put
  a piano here.
* I love FIGHTING THE
  IVORIES!!!
* Maybe I'll play you
  something sometime!
* Huh!?
* Did you solve the
  puzzle!?
* No one has ever...
* I've been waiting so
  long for someone to...
* I mean, uhhh, big deal!
* Whatever!
* Guess I've gotta
  find a new mystic
  artifact.
* That statue's been
  here forever...
* No one knows where
  it came from.
* Hey, you figured out
  how to get the
  music to play...?
* Nice, isn't it?
* Those umbrellas were
  ASGORE's idea.
* He says he doesn't
  want anyone to
  catch a cold.
* Waterfall's underwater
  citizens couldn't care
  less, though.
* Did you get a 'brella?
* What!?
* You're at my
  FAVORITE SPOT!?!?
* You'd better jump in
  at least 1000 puddles
  for me!!!
* Have you reached
  triple digits yet!?
* This whole area's
  like a little
  nature trail.
* It's nice to have
  a rainy spot away
  from civilization...
* Though, with the city
  filling up, who knows
  how long that'll last.
* Well?!
* Are you enjoying
  nature!?
* ASGORE's castle...
* Guess there's no
  stopping you, huh?
* The trail dead-ends
  here, unless you can
  jump.
* Honestly, I can't
  believe I expected
  you to go this way.
* What was I thinking???
* ... and how was I
  right???
* Don't explain it!!
* Those flowers...
* One day, they just
  started to grow
  there.
* I swear, it's like
  they have a mind
  of their own.
* That's ridiculous
  though!
* That's where I
  met Alphys for the
  first time!!
* I was looking for
  cool swords, when
  I saw her...
* Uh, standing there,
  staring into the
  abyss.
* She looked pretty...
* Um...
* ... contemplative.
* So I asked her
  where she thought
  the abyss led to!
* She looked up at
  me, shocked, and went
  red in the face.
* But I'm scary,
  so I'm used to
  that kinda stuff!
* Then she kept
  explaining all her
  different theories.
* She went on for
  hours!
* I was so captivated!
* After that, I kept
  running into her
  here.
* And now we're
  friends!
* Yeeee hawww!!!
* Oh my GOD!
* Don't make me tell
  this story AGAIN!!!
* The garbage dump!!
* So many great things
  come from there!!
* The only reason we
  have modern
  technology...
* Is 'cause of all the
  human junk that flows
  from the surface!
* Plus, it's a GREAT
  place to meet
  girls.
* Wait!
* Don't quote me on
  that one!!!
* I'm right here!
* Well, I think we
  should hang out
  with Papyrus.
* Huff... puff...!
* YEAH!!!
* That's MY HOUSE!!!
* I ran.
* Yep!
* Nope!!!
* That's my house.
* Or, it WAS my
  house, until we
  set it on fire.
* But hey, can't say
  I've never done
  that before!!
* Hey, if you find
  any cool swords in
  the wreckage...
* You know where to
  find me.
* That's Napstablook's
  house.
* They kind of keep
  to theirself, but...
* That's a good ghost.
* I try to be a good
  neighbor, but I think
  they're scared of me.
* C'mon, what's scary
  about a good-natured
  invite to wrestle!!?
* They're incorporeal
  anyway!!!
* Oh, you're hanging
  out with Napstablook!?
* That's great!!!
* I haven't seen them
  hanging out with
  anyone since...
* Well, their cousin.
* They would both watch
  TV at all hours of
  the day...
* Then they would
  practice these
  weird performances.
* Where'd they go...?
* Don't feel like you
  have to live up
  to their cousin!
* Just be your lovable
  old garbage self!
* WHAT?
* You broke into
  Napstablook's
  cousin's house!?
* That's...
* That's...!
* Hey, what was
  their name, anyway?
* Okay, that's
  DEFINITELY wrong.
* Seriously, though,
  stop committing
  ghost crimes.
* Napstablook's family
  used to run this
  farm, but...
* They've all...
* Passed on...
* ... to different jobs,
  since there's not
  much business here.
* Them and their cousin
  stayed behind to run
  the family farm.
* But no one's seen
  their cousin for a
  long time.
* Now Napstablook's
  all alone...
* Be nice to them,
  okay!?
* Cherish this ghost!!!
* Hey!
* That's the store of
  Gerson, the Hammer of
  Justice!
* The toughest monster
  that ever lived...!
* He fought in the
  war between humans
  and monsters...
* And he survived!
* He's a real hero!
* Are you gonna buy
  something?
* That river connects
  to Snowdin and
  Hotland.
* If you need to get
  from one place to
  another, jump in!
* Look, that's all we
  got for public
  transport, OK!?
* So what?
* A field of echo
  flowers...
* They babble back and
  forth to each other...
* ... until their words
  become meaningless
  noise.
* Creepy, huh?
* Stop calling me
  from that creepy
  room!!
* Once you get familiar
  with this room...
* You don't even need
  to light up the
  mushrooms!
* I mean, the path
  to Temmie Village is
  never lit up here.
* But why would you
  wanna go there!?
* It's down south if
  you want to avoid
  it.
* You don't even need
  to light up the
  lanterns!
* ... yeah.
* Whatever.
* That's where I first
  talked to you!
* Weren't you SUPER
  terrified?
* I practice that
  monologue ALL the
  time in the mirror!
* I mean!!!
* Uh!!!
* No I don't!!!
* UH!!!
* NO!!!
* I DON'T!!!!
* Do you have a
  monologue for
  EVERYTHING?
* Fields of flowers,
  whispering everybody's
  hopes and dreams...
* NGAHHHH!!!
* IT FILLS ME WITH
  POWER!!!
* NGAHHHH!!
* This room...!
* Error?
* That sure was a
  tense scenario.
* I just wanted to
  help that poor kid,
  but...
* I thought if I tried,
  you'd attack me!
* Thankfully, you
  ended up saving
  them.
* I'd actually...
* Forgotten what had
  happened here.
* You just let that
  poor kid drop to
  the floor.
* Maybe you were just
  afraid.
* But if I hadn't
  been around, then...?
* That's when you ran
  away when your friend
  asked for help!!!
* Though, who can blame
  you for fleeing from
  certain death...?
* ME!!!!
* I'm still TOTALLY
  disappointed!
* That's the WIMPIEST
  thing you've EVER
  done!
* Apologize to your
  poor friend, OK,
  buster!?
* Yeah, someone else
  has to care so I
  don't have to!
* I worked in an office
  pushing blocks for
  a month!
* My respect for block
  puzzles was depleted
  by corporate life.
* (I won't tell him
  that's not how it
  works...)
* Well, it was more
  of a, uh, community
  service thing.
* Uh, yep!
* Totally of my own
  volition there!
* Oh my GOD!!!
* Wasn't this room
  the BEST!?
* Like when I decided
  to NOT do that
  BORING monologue...
* And then went TOTALLY
  off-the-cuff!?
* Or when I almost
  killed you with
  spears???
* Or when I almost
  killed you with
  MORE spears???
* Aw man.
* I should have taken
  photos.
* Think about how cute
  a little scrapbook
  would be...
* Let's start a photo
  company for boss
  fights!
* Relive the memories...
* Going off-the-cuff...
* It helped that I...
* Uh.
* Completely forgot the
  words to my monologue,
  anyway...
* This is where I
  was chasing you...
* But you got a phone
  call, so I had to
  wait.
* What!?
* What were you even
  calling about!?
* As I was trying
  to kill them!?
* Nobody starts as
  great friends, huh?
* Well, you're gonna
  END as my great
  friend!!
* I can't believe
  Papyrus's brother was
  sleeping!!
* I was counting on
  him to stop you!!
* UrrrrgHHHH!!!
* I agree!!
* Your brother needs
  to...!
* ... wait, isn't that
  just called sleeping?
* Wait. Papyrus...
* When do YOU sleep?
* Well, I was just
  thinking...
* If you're not using
  that cool car bed,
  can I have it!?
* Thank God for that
  water cooler, huh?
* Actually, you can
  thank Alphys...
* She put it there
  just for me.
* Now I can take a
  drink on the way
  to her lab.
* Though, usually I'm
  not wearing 100
  pounds of armor...!
* Thanks for giving me
  that water, I guess.
* You're at Alphys's
  lab?
* Is she there...?
* Hey, tell her I
  said hi, okay!?
* And, tell me how
  she's doing!
* And tell me if
  she needs anything,
  and...
* Wait! No!
* Don't ask any of
  that!!!
* But she's fine,
  right!?
* What!?
* You're in her room!?
* Get out of there!
* Unless, um, she
  invited you...
* No wayyyy!!!
* That did NOT happen!
* Stop that!
* So we'll just have
  to COMBINE OUR
  POWER!!!
* Yeah, but it's a
  BIG zero!!!
* THE BIGGEST ZERO!
* No WAY!!!
* Come to Snowdin
  and visit ME!!!
* Wrong! I'm standing
  slightly to the
  right!!
* Come on!!!
* Make your choice!!!
* I rode on a
  conveyor belt
  once.
* I learned pretty
  fast that they
  make me sick.
* Yeah, like 9000
  times!!
* It was awesome!!
* Steam vents?
* I think Alphys told
  me about those.
* The CORE cools off
  by releasing steam
  through those...
* And at the same
  time, it doubles
  as transport!
* Pretty cool, if
  you aren't wearing
  a dress!
* Huh!?
* Did you put on
  a dress?
* What!?
* Why'd I call Alphys
  about the weather?
* Who CARES!?!?
* Isn't it natural
  to love meteorology!?
* YEAH!?!!
* THERE IS?!!?!
* And I'm forecasting
  an incoming front
  of SHUT UP!!!
* What!?
* What ABOUT this
  room!?
* Oh, Papyrus.
* I can't stay mad
  at you.
* Huh?
* Those kids are
  skipping school?
* ... well, I can't
  blame them, school
  sucks!
* We need to find
  some way to make
  it cooler...
* Hey, what if I
  visited their
  school!?
* Then I could beat
  up ALL the teachers!
* Okay, maybe I
  wouldn't beat up
  a teacher...
* Really? Careful, that
  dude gives me bad
  vibes.
* I don't care about
  people just because
  they're popular.
* Pssshhht, what!?
* Popular with WHO?
* Awww...
* Papyrus, you're popular
  with me, too.
* Let's not discuss
  this anymore.
* What?
* I thought he only
  had three stations.
* Who the heck keeps
  hiring this guy!?
* Seriously!!
* Oh MAN, did I ever
  tell you MY conveyor
  puzzle idea?
* Imagine four basketball
  hoops on the sides
  of a conveyor loop.
* The conveyor keeps
  speeding up, until
  you get sick...
* Then you have to
  puke in all four
  hoops in a row!!!
* You have to time
  the pukes!!!
* Oh man!!!
* You wanna hear more
  of my great idea!?
* What!?
* No, I HATE puzzles!
* Papyrus, YOU do it!
* Oh my GOD!
* NO!
* Shut up!!!
* NO!!!!
* THAT'S EVEN WORSE!!!
* Careful, the Royal
  Guard patrols that
  area.
* I think it's RG01
  and RG02 today...
* It's funny, the bunny
  actually requested to be
  with the dragon guy.
* It's nice when people
  are platonic friends
  like that!
* Yeah! You totally
  kicked his butt
  on the news!!!
* And I bet Alphys
  was helping you,
  wasn't she?
* Oh my god!!!
* You guys becoming
  friends...
* It's kinda cute...
* ... I mean, uh...
* I'm tough!!!
* I love to eat rocks!!
* What!?!?
...
* What!?
* No, we just
  became friends!!
* You can't already
  be that close...
* What?
* Hey, did I ever
  tell you about my
  puzzle idea?
* It's a maze full
  of steam vents...
* But the steam vents
  are on conveyor
  belts, and...
* Hey, this reminds
  me of a puzzle
  idea.
* Yeah, but I love
  driving you crazy!
* Where are all these
  tables coming from?
* What would a mouse
  need a table for?
* But where's the
  cheese come from!?
* doesn't it come
  from milk?
* Big deal...
* Earlier, the human
  and I danced with
  DEATH!!!
* Yeah, she's like
  super hot.
* WHAT!?
* RG01 and RG02 are
  slacking off?!
* Come ON!
* They should be KILLING
  you right now!
* Not that I want
  them to, I mean.
* But they could at
  least TRY, y'know!?
* Oh yeah, that
  reminds me.
* I told RG01 and RG02
  that if they managed
  to nab you...
* I'd take them both
  out for ice cream.
* I hope you were able
  to avoid them.
* Cause I HATE ice
  cream!!
* A hotel?? Cool!!
* I've never stayed
  at a fancy hotel!
* Papyrus, we should
  go on vacation
  sometime!
* Well, maybe we would
  go someplace besides
  the hotel, too...
* Woah!!
* A fancy restaurant!?
* Are you treating us?
* Do they have steak?
* Well, maybe our cooking
  abilities aren't
  exactly perfect.
* Nah!!!
* They totally are!!
* Eat up, punk!!
* Oh?
* No pets allowed, huh?
* What's the problem?
* What's wrong with
  dogs!?
* What's WRONG with it!?
* So you hate this dog,
  but like weird
  talking flowers?
* I mean, if having
  an imaginary friend
  makes you happy...
* What's his name.
* Oh my GOD!!!
* You just made that
  up!!
* Heyyy!!
* Let's throw a room
  party!
* We can order a pizza
  and stay up all night
  playing games!
* Nah, like "pillow
  fight the skeleton!"
* Aww, okay.
* Too late!!!
* Nah, why would I
  do that?
* I'm saving it for
  the party!!
* C'mon, Papyrus.
* Think about it.
* It stands for
  L-evator, duh!!!
* Probably?
* It stands for RED,
  'cause that's the
  color of the lights!
* Uhhhh...
* Light green.
* OK, OK.
* I've got it.
* The L stands for
  the color "Lime."
* What!? Limes rule!!
* I eat them whole
  all the time!!
* Oh my god!
* Those aren't LIMES!
* Those are CUCUMBERS!
* Gross!!
* Why did you even
  do that!?
* (He doesn't even
  HAVE eyes!!!)
* But isn't love
  supposed to be
  FIERY RED!?
* Like a cartoony
  human-heart?
* You make it sound
  like I give people
  nausea.
* Okay, yeah!
That's me!
* No WAY!
* That makes NO sense.
* Cause if you face
  the opposite way,
  they'd be wrong!
* Let's not get
  philosophical
  over the alphabet.
* Papyrus...
* Why are you
  wearing those?
* What?
* No!
* You're Papyrus!
* FINE then!
* I'm not Undyne!
* The name's...
* StrongFish91!
* Uh, OK.
* Yeah, cooking is
  definitely fire-
  elemental!
* Would you really
  call it "cooking"
  a popsicle...?
* Oh MAN, I almost
  forgot about that!
* What a mess!
* It took forever to
  hose everything off.
* The CORE is a huge
  tower of electric
  energy.
* So I don't think
  your phone will
  work through it...
* You have something
  you have to do,
  right...?
* Well...
* Even without words,
  we'll be with you
  in spirit, OK!?
* We're counting on
  you, so don't mess
  it up!
* We're not going to
  say goodbye to you
  just yet!
* Oh! And I want a
  poster for all of
  my big fights!
* And a barbeque!
* And a second
  barbeque!
* Let's do it!
* We could use the
  spears as kabob
  skewers!
* What's a kabone?
* No, ducks have
  webbed feet.
* Yeah, haven't you
  seen a duck wrap
  up a loaf of bread?
* Then suck all of
  its guts out with
  its fangs?
* Yeah. They just take
  'em all out before
  they sell it.
* (I thought he knew
  I was joking...)
* Papyrus, wait, you
  know I'm joking,
  right...?
* Do spiders even
  use the internet?
* That's Alphys's house.
* Hey, why don't we
  all go over and
  watch anime?
* Oh my GOD!!!
* Anime isn't just for
  kids! It's deep!
* It's EMOTIONAL!!!
* YEah CAUSE It'S HoW
  I'M FEElinG RIGHT
  NOW!!!
* You don't have to
  say that, Papyrus.
* YOU DON'T HAVE TO
  SAY THAT, PAPYRUS!!
* What!?
* Royal Guards are
  blocking the way!?
* Then I'll tell them
  to...!
* Well, nothing, I
  guess.
* I already told them
  to seek out and
  destroy you!
* And I can't just
  tell them I've
  changed my mind.
* You see, Alphys
  showed me these
  animations about...
* Uhhh, humans?
* So I can learn
  their weaknesses?
* And one of them
  is about this human
  that, uh...
* Well, suffice to say,
  they can control
  people's minds!!!
* Surprised?
* I know your kind's
  hidden power!
* Anyway, I told my
  crew that if I ever
  defended a human...
* I must be under
  some kind of mind
  control!
* And to disregard
  EVERYTHING that I
  tell them!
* So, sorry...
* But my hands are
  tied.
* By the way, that
  animation is
  really good!
* I'm not going to
  tell them to let
  you by!
* Hey!
* What are you up
  to, punk!?
* Ngahhhh!
* Hey!
* Who's in charge
  here!?
* Oh... yeah, that's
  right!
* I quit my job as
  leader of the Royal
  Guard.
* Actually, since we
  won't be fighting
  anymore...
* The Royal Guard
  totally disbanded.
* There's, uh, only
  one member now.
* Yeah!! He is!!!
* C'mere!!
* Anyways, now I'm
  working as Alphy's
  lab assistant...
* We're gonna find a
  way out of this dump
  once and for all!!
* Oh, yeah, and I'm a
  gym teacher at the
  queen's new school.
* Did you know I can
  bench-press seven
  children!?
* Awesome, right?
* Hey.
* I'm sorry about what
  happened with ASGORE.
* You were just doing
  what you had to.
* It's not your fault
  he...
* Ah, darn it.
* I miss the big guy.
* ...
* Come on, Undyne!
* Snap out of it!
* Uh, I guess I'll
  tell you how Alphys
  is doing.
* Well, she's the
  same as ever.
* Maybe a little more
  reclusive than
  normal.
* Seems like something's
  really bothering
  her...
* But she can get
  through it!
* I'm there supporting
  her!!
* That's what friends
  are for, right?
* Hey, where-ever you
  are...
* I hope it's better
  than here.
* It took a lot of
  sacrifice for you
  to get there...
* So, where-ever you
  are...
* You have to try to
  be happy, okay!?
* For our sakes!
* We'll feel better
  knowing our trouble
  was worth it.
* We're all with you!
* Everyone is!
* Even the queen!
* HEYYY!
* WAIT a second!
* TORIEL!
* TORIEL!
* Do you wanna...?
* Heh, she says
  she's busy.
* But call back any
  time, ok?!
* She'd love to talk!
* See ya, punk!
* I'm fine.
* Why don't you talk
  for a while?
* Oh, she SAYS she's
  busy.
* Yeah!
* She'd be happy to
  hear from ya!
* See ya, punk!
* Hey...!
* Uh, this is
  Undyne...
* (Shut up, Papyrus!)
* (This was YOUR idea!)
* HUMAN!
* You have to deliver
  something for me!
* Uh, please?
* I'm at Snowdin
  in front of
  Papyrus's.
* See ya, punk!
Undyne and Frisk
* IS THAT IT? 
 
  Yes         No
* Right???
              NEVER 
  Yes         with you
* RIGHT?
 
  True        False
Undyne the Undying
Damn it...
So even THAT
power...
It wasn't enough...?
Heh...
Heheheh...
If you...
If you think I'm
gonna give up hope,
you're wrong.
'Cause I've...
Got my friends
behind me.
Alphys told me that
she would watch me
fight you...
And if anything went
wrong, she would...
evacuate everyone.
By now she's called
ASGORE and told him
to absorb the 6
human SOULs.
And with that
power...
This world will
live on...!
You're gonna have
to try a little
harder than THAT.
You...
You're gonna have
to try a little
harder than THAT!

ASRIEL reached
the center of
the village.
There, he
found a bed of
golden flowers.
He carried
the human
onto it.
* Everything's so dirty...
* If I could erase everything,
  I would.
* Ohhhh.
* Don't get the wrong idea.
* I don't want anyone to die.
* People turn to dust when
  they die, and that's hard
  to clean up...
* Don't turn to dust.
* The surface intimidates me.
* The entire outer layer of the
  Earth is made of dirt.
* I clean off all of the
  trash and arrange it into
  symmetrical piles.
* It's hard work, but somebody
  has to do it.
* Don't drag your dirty feet
  in here.
* I just cleaned this trash!
