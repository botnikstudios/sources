What's wrong with you?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Well, what do you think?
At 2.00...
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I think you had better leave
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
Get out...
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
At home alone - where were you?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
What's this all about?
It's been what, three years?
Yes - of course.
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
That's good
Yes, come on in...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I thought it was you - how are you?
Oh...
Her husband left her
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Don't worry about it -
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
No worries
Just put it in my room
No - a dentist
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
ANGEL...
Yes - one please.
Sugar?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
I'll be sure to...
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Dead?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Yes...?
Dr STECKLER?
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Get them together.
I love those springy head puppies!
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
I thought I loved her.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
You'll never believe who's in there.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You're late, bro!
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Give me those!
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Take a whiff of heaven.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
And some really fast cars.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Dead?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Check it out!
What is it now?
Hurry.
I better go, Dad.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Yeah, whatever.
So far away? In Xenia?
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Not ever. Never.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Perv.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Cut it out, before you break something!
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Maybe he got promoted.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Well, Dad said...
Who the hell was your father?
Astronomical.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
I defy any and all limits.
That's crazy talk.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Someday, I'll find out.
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
Were you always this sick?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
See? Did you see that?
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
You and your pep talks.
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
God, I love being dead.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
These are real, live women?
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Let me get this straight...
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Never say never.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
We reinvented ourselves.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
God, you are so hot.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
I mean, what do you think?
You have changed since second grade.
Well?
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
That was code for "I like you."
Which you pulled, hard!
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
You know...take the pictures?
Do it?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Yeah? You like?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
So that's a maybe?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
So you'll think about it?
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
But that smile.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
If you don't have...I mean...
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
Well. The prom's coming up.
Ladies first.  I insist.
You go first.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We miss our family.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We love our lives just the way they are.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
Sweetheart, what is it?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We own a small family grocery store.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
I will not have my boys arguing.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Watch your tone, mister.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
You ordered a Winnebago?
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
It's okay. You need me?
Sorry I--
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Finally, some gratitude.
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Just say it, Dad.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
...not the pit.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Whatever helps you cope.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Yeah.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
I guess.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Well, why should I?
Son.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Of course we are.
You guys are my parents.
I'm getting so good at this.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
The lesson being?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
You're way ahead of me again?
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Dad, please.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
It's my private business! Mine!
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
Well?
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
What do you want me to do?
Ted! Do something!
Of course we were.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Whatever you want.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Hmmm?
Teddy? I was thinking.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Who exactly ARE you?
Hi ho, Silver.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
That's me.
The one with the horses.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Some of them have to be automatics.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Got it.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
Want a lesson?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
You do know how to drive?
They're in the ignition, silly.
I-I don't have the keys.
Everything.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Can you believe that was me?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
I understand.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
My legacy.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
You mean they knew who I was?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
You're on the next plane home.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Great.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
I didn't forget.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
That's a crappy thing to say.
I meant biologically.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
You're a peach.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
I miss them, too.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Are they okay?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Just a formality.
You want it in writing?
If you could just sign right there.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
It's not up to me.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
My room?
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Very funny.
My new bike.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Most places are, Jimmy.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
James, what are you doing here?
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
You better.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Let your fingers do the walking.
Yellow pages?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Very ambitious. I like that.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
You think you're working with chimps here?
You're quick. I like that.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
But absolutely true.
That's hard to believe.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Maybe someday.
I want you to trust me.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Come on.
Not a chance.
Do you trust me, Julie?
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
I see.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Tell me more.
I'm very aural.
What about you?
That's refreshingly deviant.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I'm trembling with excitement.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
Amen to that.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
Let's do it.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
He's on the move?
Well? Where the hell are you?
That's probably my office.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
But you never do.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
I know.
You're amazing.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
And then what?
Eventually you'll let go.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
It's incredibly simple.
It's all so complicated.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
I mean my father.
Your dad taught you everything.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
I doubt it.
I see.
He phoned it in.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
Whatever.
He didn't. He had it built.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Where are we going?
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Wow...you clean up nice.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Well? What do you think of her?
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Don't write that part.
You never know around here.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Interesting.
I guess.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I don't get the distinction.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Really? You wanna write about me?
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Me?
Then I'll write about YOU.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I'm trying to help.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
In what sense?
Your article sucked.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
I have absolutely no intention--
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
Me-ow.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Forget the store. Think big.
But who would run the store?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Like what?
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Oh. Goodness.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
But how would we pay our bills?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
I'll make you very proud.
You promise you'll finish school?
Only the best for my mother.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Well? Surprised?
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
That's part of growing up, honey.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
You called the cops on us?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
I'm warning you.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Rules are rules.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
I never figured you for a pimp.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
What are you doing?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
Yes?
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
He was in a league of his own.
My father must've been amazing.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
That's perfect.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
You think we should be more open minded?
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
What kind of ideas?
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
Really? You'd do that for me?
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You were the new and improved you.
I was like a different person tonight.
I told you you could do it.
Why, look who's here.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Me? The King of Coitus?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
I do?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
Tipping?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Seldom? No kidding?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
You're sure?
As much as possible.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Of course I like girls.
You do like girls, don't you?
I have only one concern...
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
How quaint.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
My parents? What do you mean?
It's about your parents.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
I'm just a messenger.
People pay good money for that?
Bad news.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
In a hurry, are we?
I... You know... I...
How you doing, Artie?
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
This is insane.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Kelly Van Ryan...
Talk to me Artie.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
I'd like that.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
And where might that be?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Thanks.
You look pretty.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Kelly.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Eat a power bar.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
What about the blood?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Merritt, Forensics.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
How soon can we get something?
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
You okay?
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
And the child...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
About Suzie?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Try, Kelly.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
You mean he withdrew...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Then what?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Did you try to fight him?
He was large?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I understand.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Take your time.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
I know you do.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Suzie?
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
You could tell me where you were last night.
I don't know what to say...
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Maybe she used another name.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
How long?
Suzie Toller is missing.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
No.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
I'd like that.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Where's Lombardo?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Ray, you heard him...
Will you do me one favor?
We don't know that, Ray...
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Where's the body?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Just check out the car.
If you want company...
You have someplace to be?
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
We all have...
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
You could say that.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
I net a guy in a bar.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
Eliminate the competition.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
Unless what?
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Lombardo's settlement?
You saw the news today?
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
The skinny brunette.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
It's our job, Gloria.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
Back to the land of grownups.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
What was that?
He did say something.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I guess.
Did he come in with you?
Yes.
So you were alone.
No.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Yeah.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
About a year ago.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
Why is that?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
That bothers you?
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I want a full-scale investigation.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
Where's this coming from?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
Why?
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
The teeth, were they...
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
You didn't cuff her?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
She bit you?
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Just tell us what happened.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Kelly's next, Gloria.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Oh, Ray... no...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Are you crazy, Ray?
And what do they say?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
What about witnesses?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Your Honor... Please...
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
I'm sorry?
This wasn't my idea.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
I said he did.
Ms. Toller?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
What did you do then?
I wanna go home now.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Yeah... okay... he did
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
A ride.  You want one?
What?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Thank you, Jimmy.
No!
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Yeah, but...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I say something funny?
Lombardo ever come out here?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
It's those rocks, up there.
Shit.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Nothing.
What are you looking at?
What brain?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
You are.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
You can trust me.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I'm not on your property!
Get off my property.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
You're out of your mind.
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
Excuse me?
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Curiosity, I guess.
Is there some reason why you're here?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Where, the mall?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Yes.  God, Mom...
He... Sam Lombardo?
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
What?
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
No you don't.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
I miss Dad.
Kelly.  What is it?
No thanks to you.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
You notice my new jumper?
Okay, what's the matter?
Whichever one I want.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Sam!  Hi!
Hi, Mon.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
You think that's wise?
I'm running away.
No little girl can ever make me come.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Say you love me.
That's not your line.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Okay.  I love you too.
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
And you believe her?
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Duquette.  Forget him...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
God, I've been calling you.
Hello.
Hello?
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
I'm here.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
You know what it takes.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Why can't you come...
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Yes.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Stick?
We have to stick with the plan.
Do it to ourselves?
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
About six and a half million dollars.
How much?
So you got my mom's money.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Kelly...
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
So, where you off to now?
In back of the garage.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
I won't.
Don't forget the car wash.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
Just like that?
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Come on, let loose!
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I just want my life back...
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
There's nothing for them to get.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Forget it.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Good thinking.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
But check this...
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
You can't...
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Where is she?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Who is it?
That's right.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Sam, for godsake.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
That's right.  That was his name.
Davy.
Shut up.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Get away from me.
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
You, Kelly, Sam.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
About what?
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
That's cop bullshit.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
You got something against cigarettes?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
It doesn't look like it.
Will they?
No.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Jesus, man... You okay?
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
You mean this thing?
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Sit down, Lombardo.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
That's right.
But she ran away.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
The one you bought at school.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Story's the same, Detective...
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
How...
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
We?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
What's wrong?
That was the same thing Ray said.
What?
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
That was about as grim as it gets.
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
Are you mad at me?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Yeah, right.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
But I..
Put Kelly on too.
Sam...
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Goodbye, Sandra.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Shit. Here we go again.
No.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Sandy... What's up?
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Hi, Sandy.
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
I'm sure we will.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
What is this?  A whole new train?
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
In the next two minutes?
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Where have you been?
My God!  He's so excessive!
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
God in heaven, what is that?!
Thank you.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Of course not.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
It was in your book.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
There's only seventy-eight.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I know!  I know!
What?  President Grant is...!
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
My pleasure.
Oh, thank you.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
When we find him, he is mine.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
I adjusted it.
Not again.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
And people are actually fooled by that?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
What is that?
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Relax.  We're almost there.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
It's a town!
It's not a guy...
Willard...
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
What's this?
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
No record of him.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
It is?
It's better than nothing.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
This is good.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Know what this is?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Thank you.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Can you fill me in here?
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
They're so precious when they're asleep.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
You might have mentioned you had that.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
So... what happened?
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Well... that, too.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
What way is that?
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Jim, are you all right?
That's right... That's good.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Hey, I tried the board.
At least I tried something.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
I'm going to hit you.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
All that jumping and kicking.
All what?
What was all that back there?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Now, what was that?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
You feeling all right?
Yes.  Now, observe....
Almost?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
That's a lot of butler.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
My disguise.  And here...
Prepare what?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Limestone quarry?
What about the explosive?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Starting with a screw?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Is this leading somewhere?
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Aha?
Aha!
I'll work on it.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Try what?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Always hoping.  Or this...
You need that real often?
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Wouldn't dream of it.
But don't pull that again.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Funny.  So am I.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Jim West.
J. S. Bach.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
He's not giving up?
But it only has six legs.
He calls it the Tarantula.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
Yes, me!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Anyone?
We'll see.
A new friend?
Fine, I'll stop.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
You bring the best out in a man.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
She's perfectly safe.
I've had some practice.
You've... done... this... before.
Oh, I would hope not.
Would that include me?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
You tell me.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
I don't like to lose, either.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You most certainly do.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Your guests, ma'am?
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
My... the wild west.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Really?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
My friend?
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Private train?
Your private train, sir.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Yes sir.
French?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
On my way to Denver...
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
And now the job's yours.
And?
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Nicely said, sir.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Good work.  Really.
That'll be all, boys.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Easy now.
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
The first.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
I've even printed my own currency.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
That would be... the Mexican War?
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Philistine.
He had a pressing engagement.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
You're not that big.
Dr. Loveless?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
I deal with some tough customers.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
I beg your pardon?
It is?
Now it's a bomb.
It's a smelting retort.
This is something.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
Are you all right?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Who was this partner of his?
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
We'll explain on the way.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Yes!
Dr. Pemberton?
Right.
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You're not going to use it, are you?
Hey...!
In an hour they're gone!
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
When are they coming?
They're coming.
Well?
Let's go.
Thank you, friend.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Just get me some horses.
You're chasing a dream.
Then come with us.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Is this what's left of your army?
You managed alright.
You left me to die, friend.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
They look like acorns.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
You are very important, Willow.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
What is Tir Asleen?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Me?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
Yes...?
Willow Ufgood.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
Not today, Willow.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
I have no family.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Madmartigan.
Sorsha.
I don't believe you.
Because it's true.
I love you.
Say what?
Why did you say that?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I do what I'm told.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
You're not a woman.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Why not?
Why not?
I can't.
Let me see it.
I can't.
No.  I mean yes.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
As above, so below.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Who is that girl, anyway?
I will!  But I need help!
Then you get us out of here.
He turned that monster into stone!
He's no magician.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
I don't know, Willow.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Ahhh!
Watch it!
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
She's a bird, Willow.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Want me to carry Elora?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
You?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
She's in love.
Well what did she say?
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Willow!
She said lots of thing.s
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
Who?
Did she ask about me?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
I won't.
I'll help you...!
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
You?
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I did?
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Elora Danan!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I thought you had her!
Where's the baby??
Because she's sick.
Because she's sick.
Time to leave.
Time to change her diaper.
Nursemaid?!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Where the hell did you come from?
You!!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Of course!  I promise!
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Absolutely!
Fresh goat's milk.
I will.
You gotta promise to feed her.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
I hate this.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Friend of yours?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
What is it?
You hear trouble.
What's that?  I hear something!
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Are you a warrior?
Smells like a battle.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
You all right?
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
Farmer.
You a woodcutter?
I don't know.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Are you okay?
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Why.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Miserable Pecks.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Good.  How long will it take?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Are you scared?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Dada, what's a daikini?
Absolutely not.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Courage, Willow.
Patience, Willow.
Surrender!!
Time is running out.
She's too powerful, Raziel
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Just do it!
Why?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
More!  More!
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
How??
There's nobody here.
Tir Asleen.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
I just wanted to test it first.
Now use it.
His will.
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
What'd you bit me for!!
Shhhhh!
Ouch!!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Me!
But what am I gonna transform??
The art of transformation!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
The limitless power of...
What's the magician's weapon?
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
How am I gonna do that?
Burn it to a fine ash.
I'm all finished.  Now what?
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
What do I need for that?
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Then I will teach you.
That's all I ever wanted!
You must learn magic.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
No.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Kill him!
No!
Kill him!
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
What do you want!
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Who are you!  Who are you!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Get back here, Rool!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
We gotta follow them.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Are you sure?
Me neither!
I'm not going in there.
He never misses.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Somebody has to do it.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Here.  Hold her.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
She's hungry.
I don't know much about him.
Who is he?
Madmartigan.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
I changed her already!
She needs to be changed.
Shut up.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Obviously.
The sorceress.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
How are we going to get out there?
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Hey, careful there!
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Talk!  Say something!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
This is not going well.
Why not?
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Ohhh, I hate this.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
I'm getting her out of there!
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Who??
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Queen Cherlindrea?
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Not one this big.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Good, you start tomorrow.
I've seen pictures.
Cows. You know, cows?
Milking?
Maybe milking.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Just do it!
John, why?...
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, I don't understand any of this.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
They're Amish.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Oh sure, Fred.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Sorry. It's important.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Pick up the hat.
Everything is all right, John.
Yes, sir.
Nail it!
Pretty much.
Your hole is healed, then?
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
It's been a while.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Try the house.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
I thought I was the English.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Sure have, Sam.
Have you got your gun on now?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Are you really ever coming back?
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Don't let them hurt you.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
What are you going to do?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Are they going to kill you?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Is it them?
What's that, Sam?
...I want to say a thing.
Hey, Sam...
You don't say.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
No pistol. Ever.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
He was... like him.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Who'd you see?
I saw him.
Move! Or you die right here!
It's all over, Paul.
Don't try me, Johnny!
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Johnny 
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
Just us.
Who else knows?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
What's your first move?
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Just us.
Who else knows?
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Maybe.
You know who?
Maybe.
So one of them got to him.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
What have you got?
Yeah.
Amish.
Oh, he's good.
How reliable is this kid?
Here. Whenever you want them.
Where's my baggy pants?
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
That's God's way!
That's your way, not mine.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Aren't you? After today?
You're so sure of that?
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
I was being foolish?
I know.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
There was.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Won him over just like that.
Not long... A few days.
When will you be going?
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
But... You may not be well enough.
Sure.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
What else can you do?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
You know carpentry?
A real fireball.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Oh. The bullets.
The... bullets?
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
I know what he said.
But Stoltzfus said...
I'm going this morning.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
No. I'd want a public phone.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Anything against zippers?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Hochmut?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Something wrong with buttons?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Your husband's?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Enjoying your reading?
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You tell him. When you're able.
Tell him his tea stinks.
But you can't.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Two days.
How long have I been here?
What?
How long?
Only the elders.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Can I have something to drink?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Who are they?
But 
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
But why?
No, no doctor...
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
I can't.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I was wrong.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Home.
Where are you taking us now?
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
But why would they murder...
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Oh? Anything else?
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
No.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
But not a good tired.
I would not be too sure.
They kid a lot.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
We do not go into your courts.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Whacking?
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Now what's the problem?
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
What was that?
It's not a joke.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You have no right to keep us here.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Where are you taking us?
There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Make that 1790.
Say again?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You hear me?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I'm coming.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
It's me.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
I hear you.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
It won't happen again.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
I got there late, John.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
I didn't even know about it.
Anybody know about this?
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
He's got my number.
You're the first one he'll contact.
I admit I don't know where he is.
You admit you're lying?
Probably.
You'd lie to protect him.
Wrong.
You know where he is.
But... if you had to guess?
I don't know where he is.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Not yet.
Did you find him?
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
No? Why not?
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
God, Fred...
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
What's so funny?
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
You didn't have to...
Good morning.
Oh.
Yes.
John said you're Amish.
Yes, thank you very much.
Everything okay?
I have to help him!
No, Rachel...
You shame yourself.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I will be the judge of that.
You are acting like one!
I am not a child.
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
That is idle talk.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I have committed no sin.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
I know.
That has no place in this house.
Looks dead...
No...
Is the English dead?
His name is John Book.
Who was that man?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
All right, where is he?
He's not in this building.
They don't have any shit.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Lean on him.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
What about Carter?
I don't think she knows.
She say where he is?
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
My son is out there!
Get back in there.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
You might have killed him!
He'll live.
You have no right here!
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
No, you listen. Get out!
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
I wish dawdie was with us.
They are English. They don't understand.
I don't want to stay here.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Momma... are they angry with us.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Is this where we're going?
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
No --
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Yes, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Dorothy!
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
No --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Oh -- all right.
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Aunt Em!
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Uhh -- yeah --
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
You'll be hist...
From now on you'll be history
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
If any!
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Is morally, ethic'ly
If she?
If she...
To see?
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
You are?
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Who are you?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Do you presume to criticize the....
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Not so fast!  Not....
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
...resourceful!
Oh ....
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
...have you come back?
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Our echo.
Goodbye, folks!
Oh --
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Ohhh!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh ....
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
I don't believe you!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Hickory!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
This?
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Catch him, you fool!
Run, Toto, run!
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Ahh!  Ah!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
...didn't you?
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Are you ready now?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Whenever you wish.
Oh, now?
Toto, too.
...Toto, too?
I have?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
I thought you said she was dead.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Toto's my dog.
Oh!  Well....
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh -- 
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh, you....
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, no -- no!
...bed.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
...paper?
Has it poppies on the wall....
...room --
What's she doing now?
Uh-huh.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Me?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Her -- her name is Emily.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
...her face is careworn.
Oh -- yes.
That's our farm!
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Oh --
No, they won't - honestly.
Aw, come, come, come --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh --
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Yes --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Why --
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
How did you guess?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Stop her!
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
No --
Now you're seeing reason.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Look -- it ticks!
...yes.
Yes...!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
You've had plenty of time already!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
I knew you would!
Dorothy!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh --
Can't that female take no for an answer?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
And him a brain.
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
What sort of an animal is that?
And bears!
Oh --
We might.
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Oh-oh-
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh --
Oh! Oh!
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh --
Oh --!
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Well, you're perfect now.
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh --
Oh...
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My mouth -- my mouth!
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oil can....
Did you say something?
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh, my! 
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Ohhh!
They're coming back!
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Did they hurtcha?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Oh --
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Does it work?
Huh?  What'd he say?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Oh, come on.
Because I'm still scared!
But why?  Why?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
How about a hippopotamus?
Not nobody, not nohow!
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
I'll be home in time for supper!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Who's her?  Who's her?
Hah!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Yes.
Yes -- let's run!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
The nerve.
A home --
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Oh.
...has been simply unbearable.
You're right -- I am a coward.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
No, but you tried to.
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
I have so got brains.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
No -- No -- No -- No!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Oh -- Oh --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Yes -- there --
Oh --
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
...along.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Yes --- there.
The other side....
Here -- here --
He said his mouth.
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Oil can what?
Yes.  Oh -- look --
What?
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oh --
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
To Oz!
To Oz?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
I don't blame you for that.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Yes -- that's true.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
They would?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Did I scare you?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
...free!
My, it's good to be....
Ohhh --
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Ohh!
Ohhhh --
...yes.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
It's pleasant down that way, too.
...don't talk.
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
It's too late!  There they....
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
...ting the ruby slippers?
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
Leave her alone!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
It did?
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Dorothy next!
Ah --
Yeah.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah!
You humbug!
This way!  Come on!
Where -- where do we go now?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Stop pushing!
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Now...
Up!
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
That's right.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Yes, you.
Yeah. Me?
And you're going to lead us.
Fine.  He's got a plan
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
What was that?
Here --   Come on.
I -- Oh --
Oh, you did it yourself!
Somebody pulled my tail.
What happened?
What's the matter?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
I don't know.
Who at?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Don't you start it, too!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Not nohow!
You don't get around us that easy!
Don't push!
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Yeah.
Where do we go now?
You don't neither --
No?  Now, wait a minute.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Yeah --
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Whozat?
Whozat?
It's a whatzis?
It's a whatzis.
Hold still - hold still --
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Imposserous!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Dorothy!
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Oh, scared, huh?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
NO!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No, her dog!
You mean she bit you?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
... about Dorothy.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Mr. Gale!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
...of the West.
Ohhhhhh!
Quiet!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
...junk!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
...Tin Man!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Go on!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yeah --
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Oh, no!
No, you don't.
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Come on, fellows!
Oh --
...to Dorothy!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
We'll get you together!
Oh, dear, dear.
Now, now, don't fret.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Well, that's you all over.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
It's a whozis?
It's a whozis.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
You know something?
Oh - look out.
Oh, did - did you see that?
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Ho -- ho --ho
Ha -- ha -- ha --
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Yes.
Let's.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Hey, Dorothy!
Emerald City!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Hurry -- hurry --
Come on -- come on --
A heart --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
To Oz!
To Oz?
We do.
That's right.
No, sir!
No, sir!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
How can I ever thank you enough?
Th.D.?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
You promised us real things -- a real...
Well --
Well, I --
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well, I --
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well, I --
What about us?
Yes.
It makes you nervous?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Help!
-- Ruined my exit!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Stop that dog!
Yes -- ....
But I still want one.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
We cant.
Weve got to get out.
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
But what if...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Like riding a bike.
Do you know what youre doing?
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Hes sealed himself in.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Is there another way?
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Zukovsky...
Elektra would control it all.
The King pipeline.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Made to look just like an accident.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Nuclear.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
What is it?
I was hoping you could tell me.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Makes her look even more innocent.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Elektra King.
Whos she?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
What the hell are you talking about?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
Then its no longer a bomb?
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
Alright then, brunch.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
With this?
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
Bond --
So who are you?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Dont know any doctor jokes.
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
You new?
I could come for a second opinion?
...yes?...
Perhaps after this ... test?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
James.  It wouldnt really be...
Its just a scratch.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
The inside man?
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
The worm on the hook again.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
He survived?
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Renard.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Who?
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
I was the one who brought that money in...
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
I took the initiative.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Shes not a girl anymore.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Old friend?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Constructions not exactly my line.
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
The name?
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Your last chance. Take the money.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Who did you get it from?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Shell get over it.
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Consider me ungrateful.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Who is it?
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Indeed.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Im sorry.
He was my father.
You knew him well?
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Yes.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Oh James.
One... last... screw?
Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
Was this all about the oil?
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
So you killed your father.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
You turned Renard.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Soon shell be everywhere.
Wheres M?
Not interested.
I could have given you the world.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Im coming with you.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
He used your exact words.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
I think you do.
I dont know what youre talking about!
You can drop the act, its over.
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
...what?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
What are you talking about?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
How did you survive?
Shush.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Really?
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
What the hell are you doing here?
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Vodka martini.
I have to go to work.
I dont want to be safe!
No. Youll be safe here.
Then take me with you.
I have to go.
James...
...you should rest.
What is it?
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I know.
I cant stay.
Its the only way out...
No!  It will cave in!
Youre not going to.
I cant stay here.
Were alright.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
No.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Does this look familiar to you?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
How long has he been with you?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Who is he?
Partially, yes.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Yes.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
How appropriate.
The Maidens Tower.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Mother of God.
Istanbul.
Where?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
No!  Get me out!
Wheres the sub going?!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
And the payoff on the tables?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
A rope!
Now...where were we?
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
I thought you were the one in her business.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
Where did you get this?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
What?  This is not possible.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
You, of course. I need some information.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Valentin Zukovsky.
C-class.
What class sub does your nephew run?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What is this place?
Bond!
No! Bond!
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
What?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Someone will come.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Your father...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Please.
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Could...could you come?
Ill send someone out.
Yes.  Au revoir...
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
This is the end.
What do you think?
He was a...good lover?
Of course...
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
How would you know?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Is it?
Warm.
Still no contact yet.
Any word from him?
Where it can do the most damage.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
The parcels in the post.
Marvellous.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Please.
What?!
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
I would like to use the bathroom --
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Why?  What's the problem?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What about our end?
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Washington?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
No idea who's behind this?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
We don't know that.
God isn't there to do it.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
A whore fucking.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Wrong answers?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Don't call me that.
Walter --
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
What's your theory?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
The bearer of bad news.
Hello, Adrian.
Hi, Jon.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Jon --
Veidt¹s complex.
Jon, where are we?
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
Jon -- what??
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Cured, yes.
What -- am I --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I won't do that.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You're the only human being I care for.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Because --
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Jon, no -- I can't --
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Collect me?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I could stay and go.
Mm hmm.
Would you like me to stay?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
I'm here, Laurie.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Blake?  Dead?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
What if you¹re wrong??
I¹m not.
And what if you¹re wrong?
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Adrian -- you've lost it.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
What is it?  How does it work?
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What??
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
The missing scientists.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
She's with me.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Who?
Good night.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
No.  I just wanted you to --
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Dan -- what do we do now?
Everything's changed --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Where did he go?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
What was he doing?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
I think he's going to the john.
What's he doing?
. . . What??
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
That's because --
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Yes you are.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
The costumes.  Am I right?
What?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
They're practically on us . . .
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
All right.  Mission accomplished.
They're following us.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
What the hell -- ?
Okay!
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Don't look.  Turn around.
What are you up to?
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
You and me.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Antarctica??
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Memory lane.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Laurie --
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
-- What is it.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
. . . What?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Old?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
His . . . whatever.
His what?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
You're sure?
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Maybe not, but why take chances?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Damn straight.

Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
What caused it?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What happened?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Coward.  Giving up.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Where's Laurie?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
What do you mean, frame-up?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What new information?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
. . . That was quick.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
So do I.  So do you.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
-- What?
I can fix it.
Janey, will you marry me?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back --  What?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
With lots of ketchup?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Isn't it true that you --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Did you know he was back on the streets?
No comment.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Am I free to go?
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
What does this mean?  What does it --
I'm terribly sorry.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I don't know their real names!
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names.
Their real names, please.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Maybe I'll do that.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
What about you?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Please.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Adrian.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
You're making a big --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
What is that ungodly smell?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Ever see one of these before?
New information.
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Who says you're the good guys?
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Yes it does.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Thanks.
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
We're not after car thieves here.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
Is that all?
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Up yours.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Not bad for a gimp.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
What do I get out of it?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
Is that a fact?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Why is that?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
Looks like a diner.
What is this place?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Who the hell are you?
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
That's exactly why we need them.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
But programmable. And expendable.
The scum of the Earth.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
How will you fix it?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
What do you have?
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Whatchu doing here?
He gets to be the hero.
Like what?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
What do you get if you finish?
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
What weapons do you have?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Naturally.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
What game is that?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
What are you doing?
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You can't talk to it?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You okay?
Let me.
Toadies right behind.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Where'd the damn truck go?!
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Where's he headed?
Let's do this.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Did you do your homework?
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Yorgi and Kirill.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
You don't have to do that.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Aren't you afraid?
We'll have to go after them.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Where are we going?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Are you alright?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
When can I see you again?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
What's that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
What are you talking about?
They tell me you're an American agent.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
I'm from L.A.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
What are you?
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
Go to hell!
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Hey, you're good.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
We hung out last night, remember?
Who are you?
That right? Why's that?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
I was invited. What's your story?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Where are you going?
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Mind your business.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Go to hell.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Yorgi asked me to.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
The Peace conference...
Viktor! Stay the course.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
What was that for?
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
What are you doing?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Nothing. He had two days.
I thought that was in detail.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
You're joking, right?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
I think I'll hang on to these.
That one I'm real familiar with.
This is your standard dart gun.
They come in any other styles or colors?
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
That's would be me.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're serious?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
What...?
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Alright, so I'll get more.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I can see that. Why?
I'm through, Xander.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Why you dogging me up?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
What's the deal?
Sorry, "dude".
Is this what you're looking for?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Dude, what are you doing here?
Yeah, thanks a lot.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Nice hops.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Here we go again.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
Sit down.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Help me with this guy.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Been to any good diners lately?
What's so damn funny?
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
That was for Anders.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
You wanna see my politics?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Had to do what I had to do.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
What's going on, my friend?
This is a gift. From me to you.
What's this?
Of course.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Very nice. I'm impressed.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
When else are you gonna do it?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
That's the guy.
Beast.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
We all do.
I wish I could go.
... until he found tungsten.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
What does that mean?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
For what purpose?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Its core?
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
Jean... can you?
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
It's too far.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Uh-huh.
Into the Hudson?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
What's that?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Are you all right?
We have to find Magneto.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
What's wrong with him?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What are you talking about?
I don't like him being here.
Scott.. I -
Sure you are, sport.
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
You know, you --
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I wanted to talk to you.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Logan, do you see this ring?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
He takes himself seriously.
He takes his work seriously.
He's uptight.
Suit yourself.
Let go.
Not interested.
What do you say?
Were you now?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He's busy right now.
You should always work with a spotter.
What if they're naughty?
If necessary.
By reading my thoughts?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
What if I like the pain?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Anything else I can get you?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Senator?
Dr. Grey.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
What is it you intend to do to me?
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
The intention of registration act -
Gosh, I hope so.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
You mutant bastards...
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
What are you going to do?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Where am I?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What do you want?
I do love a good check mate.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Don't you knock?
I'll go.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
He helped you?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
You designed this yourself?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
How?
To find Rogue.
Where are we going?
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Now that's Magneto talking.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
The point of what?
Deal.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Who?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
What am I doing here?
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
If she held on any longer she could have.
I felt like she almost killed me.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
What did she do to me?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
ALIVE.
I'll find him.
Enough for a test.
Is it enough?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is that what you're looking for?
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
How?
I lost him.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
It does indeed, Max.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
I know.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
What do you mean to do?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
The way what is going to be?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Is that so?
What do you want with him?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Oh, shit.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Now wait a minute!
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Poppycock!
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Victor Frankenstein.
What was your grandfather's name?
No!
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
And who might you be?
You have the wrong house.
Frederick Frankenstein?
... No!
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir?
Carlson!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Give him an extra dollar.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
From your office, sir.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Yes, sir.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
I did, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Is it that music?
MMMmm!
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMMmmmm.
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Baack!
What?
Baack!
What in God's name are you doing?
I...
Miss me?
Well... yes.
Surprised?
Hello...?
Darling!
That's my good boy.
Good night.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
I suppose you're right.
Is it worth taking a chance?
That's a tough choice.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
I suppose you're right.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
All right then!
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Why does he call you 'master'?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
What a strange fellow.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Ready, darling?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Darling!?!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Love me?
Surprised!
Surprised?
Darling!
Darling!
Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
You bet your boots it does.
Does that mean you love me?
You're incorrigible!
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Whatever makes you happy.
I hope you like large weddings.
Oh, nice.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Very....very!
Will you miss me?
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
I promise.
Promise??
Yes.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes, don't worry.
And your passport?
Yes.
You have your tickets?
Of course.
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Good.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Will there be anything else?
Well... we'll see.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
This is the only library I know of.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
There seem to be quite a few books.
May I have it, please?
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
Yes!... the laboratory.
You mean... the laboratory??
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
It seems fine.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
One week at the most!?
Yes, sir.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
I didn't do that.
Break that old man's violin.
What?
Why did you do that?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
A week.  Ten days at most.
How long will this whole thing take?
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Fron kon steen!
Dr. Frankenstein?
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
But your grandfather's work, sir...
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But, sir...
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Nineteen, sir.
How old are you, young man?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
My father was a sick man.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Vermicelli.
A piece of what?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
I beg your pardon?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
It's the only way.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Is everything ready?
Come on, big fellow!
I'll bet it's a doozy.
There's only one way.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
That sound good, boss.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
What???
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
What monster?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
I'm a failure.
That's what we're paid for.
Thanks...for all your help.
Maybe...if you get here on time.
Can you play it?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Where is he?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
What did you find out?
How's it going?
Act casual!
Yes, Master!
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
No, no!  That whole thing!
... I'm glad that's...
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
I'm not trying to be funny.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Why?
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Yes.
You can say that again.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
Original.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Don't fall for that one.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
It wasn't me.
But you did -- I just heard it.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Who are you talking to?
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You can't win 'em all.
Wait till he sees the bill.
Throw the third switch!
What?
More, do you hear me?
What?
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
This guy means business.
Throw the second switch!
You've got it, master.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Tonight?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
All right... elevate me!
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Thank you, Master.
If you like -- just hurry!
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Why?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
That's not bad.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Hmm!
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
Was he any good?
I want that brain.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I have a pretty good idea.
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Could be raining!
How?
Could be worse!
What a filthy job!
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Taking the book along?
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Must be the music room.
What is this place?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Did you see anyone else down here?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
Just putting up some tea.
But what you were doing?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What are you doing here?
Fro-derick!
Aye-gor!
I wonder what's got into them?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Home.
Home!
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
The wockers with the knockers.
What wockers?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
No.
I thought you wanted to.
Why are you talking like that?
There wolf!  There castle!
I beg your pardon?
There.
What hump?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Yes, just the two.
Are these your bags?
How do you do?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
I'm sure we will.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
You must be Igor.
I see.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
No, Fred ereck.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Are you putting me on?
Fron kon steen!
Frederick Frankenstein?
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
MMMmmmmmm.
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Get the sedative ready!
... It's.
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
Hello there.
It's alive!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Ja, ja.
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Oh, just a little.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
May I see your violin?
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
What's that tune that you're playing
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMmmm.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Yes, I will.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Yes, I know.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes...yes, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Yes, I have mine.
But, after all, you have yours.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
And Elizabeth has hers.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Nor to Elizabeth.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
What?
Of course not.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
I know Frederick.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I see what you mean.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Not fooling around.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Just passing through the night.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Good night!
Good night, Doctor.
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
I think so.
Did you do it?
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Give him the sedative!
Are you serious??
All right -- give it to him!
Stop -- singing!!!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
This is not the finals -- just sing!
I'd be so nervous.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Me?  Sing?
Do you think you can sing it?
I think I'll...carry him.
What are you going to do?
What do you think we should do?
It looks that way.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
I think you've done it, master.
Oh, Doctor!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
It wasn't me.
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I thought it was wonderful.
Reputation.  Reputation!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Right here?
I know.
Yes!
A god?
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
And look at this, Doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, doctor!
But who was playing it?
Well, this explains the music.
Look, Doctor!
What a filthy mess.
Ooh!
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Inga, wake up!
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Inga!
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Would you like a sandwich?
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well...
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Are you busy?
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
How nice.
Extremely well.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Yes.
Three minutes to go!
Four
How long is it so far?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
How do you know they're done?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Look how far we've come.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
I'm getting tired.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
His schwanzstucker.
His what??
There must have been someone else down here then.
No, not sound.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Foooooood!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Drink!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Food!!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!
Yes, sir, name, please?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
I'm explaining my reasons.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Certainly, Sin
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Yes?
Thank you.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
But will they make good use of them?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Yes.
Stuart?
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Which one?
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
