Just hold them close and stay still.
I feel like an idiot.
Are you serious?
Follow that busboy.
The drinks...Stay on them.
What glasses.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
That's a big if.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Who, me?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
That place. By the window.
Get close to them.
You have no taste.
They both look good to me.
The beautiful one.
Which one is she?
Doesn't.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
What did that cost?
Why not?!
Not that tie with that coat.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
It is my business. It's my name.
Mind your own business.
Not blue enough.
Much too blue.
This...is not going to work out.
You really like that shirt?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
What is it?
Is something glinting?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
But what's it look like?
What are you looking at?
Now, where would I be?
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Yeah. I did it.
Well you did it today.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Rene...
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
I made it work.
It worked.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Without your pants.
To the hotel. To register.
Where are you going?
...Rene...
What happened?
No...you idiot!
...Joe.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
What?
Touch her.
Where are you staying?
Where is she staying?
Wait.
Wait.
.
.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
What?
Don't just stand there, say something.
What do I do?
What can I do? You're on your own.
Help me out, will you?
How should I know?
Which language?
Try another language.
She doesn't seem to understand.
What's happening?
You're beautiful..
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What is it?
You're out of shape.
She's...pretty fast.
Follow it.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
A girl.
What was?
Beautiful!
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What? What do you mean?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Where are you going? Wait!
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
It's sand.
Why not?
I don't want to eat it.
Eat it.
Eat it?
The sand.
Now what?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
You eat it.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Little late for that.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Good Idea!
Swim.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Do you notice anything.
...Just beautiful.
What is it?
Holy shit!
Just get there.
Eating sushi?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
The beach?
The beach.
Now what?
You leave my glands alone!
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
You'll be me.
Oh yeah, to what?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
It's just not enough.
We'll change your appearance.
They'll know who I am.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
...and a license to kill...
You are in trouble. Now do it.
I'll get in trouble.
Who cares?
It's illegal.
Why not?
I can't do that.
Use my credit cards.
I don't have any.
What about it?
What about money?
We get on which plane?
We get on a plane.
You mean...just leave.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
What do we do?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
What is it?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Who is it?
Good. Get to a phone.
I'm at the airport.
I'm back.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Just scratched my arm, why?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Nothing!
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You need ID in there?
Don't know.
Gone where?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
That's not a good idea.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Black suits and helmets.
What do you mean?
Like the guys that attacked us.
I can't remember..
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
The man.
Who did?
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
A lab and equipment.
Where are we going?
Take a left and your next right.
Corridor A.
What does it say.
Which way do I go?
With Authority!
Just walk down the hall?
Go out, take your first left.
Now what.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Door's locked.
We have to get out of here.
I don't like the sound of that.
I'll sue.
Sue them.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Find You?
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
I'm not leaving until you do.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Thanks.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I did. I brought you back here.
You gotta help.
What do you mean we.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You are CRAZY!
I am. You are.
Yeah...Who is?
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They could put you back in the tube..
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
JOE Or what?
Why?
It can't take that long.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Did you hear that?
No. Don't tell the guards.
I don't know...To get Al.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
Calm Down! Act rational.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Why? AL  You know too much.
Too late...They want you.
I want out.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Then what are you stopping for?
I wouldn't say that.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Now what?
This is a Fiesta!
Outrun them.
What do I do?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
What'd he look like?
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
What's that?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Behind us?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Anyone there?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
I'll tell you what to say.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll talk to them.
Why not?
No they won't.
Why don't you?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
You weren't listening!
Who was that? Somebody out there?
What was that?
Yeah.
With a man in my head...
You'll be alive.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Why he's argumentative?
Yeah.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You're gonna explain.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Then I'm crazy.
Of course you do!
Hear voices don't I.
You're not crazy.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Yep.
Are you crazy?
Kill myself.
What for?
Loading a gun.
What are you doing?
You said it.
I know...it sounds insane.
Then how'd I get here?
I just went there for a job.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
No.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Me? What'd I do?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Are you threatening me?
That a new Datsun?
You've heard of the PEM114...
What are you doing in my head, Al?
I told you, my name is Al.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Yeah...Who?
Who am I?
Who are you?
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Right.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
No.
My place, can't you see?
Where are we now?
Somebody's been here.
Shut up!
Yeah?
Do me a favor, Al.
...I need to make a phone call.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Why don't we go home?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
What street?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Where are we?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
I just got here.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What is your name?
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
I see...
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
You're in my head...
This candid camera?
Yes?
Al.
Al.
Who?
Me.
Who was it?
It wasn't him.
Arrrgh!
Why not.
Don't do that.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
What's going on?
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
I'm...inside you.
Try me.
You're not gonna believe this...
Where are you,...Al?
Al ???!!!
My name is AL.
Who's you?
No, not her. Me.
I know you did!
I said something.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
You just got a Mickey.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
JOE What abilities...?
It's all we've got.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
I knew you were trouble.
Then what?
Let us get to the border!
What kind of a deal?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Nice?
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
I didn't do anything.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I'm...scared.
Don't worry.
Can you fly this?
I insist.
I'm against it.
Dieter?
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Good.
Oh, I can't.
No!
Don't give her your name.
What is your name?
Do what? What'd you do?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
The best part. She'll love it.
What part what?
Doesn't matter.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
It'll remind me of you.
Sorry...
Aren't we all.
Not that truth!
What a nerve!
They have stolen state property.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
It's a long story.
In him?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
What happened?
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Me.
Who's our little man?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
Impossible.
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
Rene?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
How about a deal?
Newer, more powerful design.
**?!! 
PEM115!
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
You've cut your hair?
Then how did you know?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Bit expensive, sir.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Sir?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
What Job?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
He work for us?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Surveilliance on them all.
We'll have to let them go.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
You have nothing...
They took the tapes.
Surveillance Cameras?
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
Enough ROmance.
He's not an ordinary man.
Yes?
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
It's just money.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Yes. Joe.
That crazy guy?
I have a new client.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
Join us.
We met on the beach.
Who is your friend?
I think I've heard of you.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
What brings you here?
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
And how do you service foreigners.
...Foreign service.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
It is to me too.
That name's familiar.
Al Viola.
We insist.
I don't want to intrude.
You...him...UST.
Sue who?
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Been hearing voices.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Ahhh...nothing.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Al?
I don't know Who.
Who?
Not you. Them.
Why would we want to hurt you?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Take the card.
What?
Joe.
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
I will?
You'll feel better
I feel fine.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Oh....Sure.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Here?
We're here.
Well what?
Well...
Thanks.
Fine. You look fine.
How do I look?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Who...are you?
Right.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Remember what?
When you remember...
Do what?
When you do...
Oh...that's okay.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
What things?
You may not remember things.
Oh.
It may have been affected.
What about it?
Your memory.
What?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Just give me the keys.
Don't do it!
Thanks, I appreciate that.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
A little voice in my head.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
I noticed you staring.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Yessir...very good sir.
The fresh tuna?..
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Sir?
Now you know what I know.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Sir?
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
I didn't say anything.
Oh...and who is it!?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
Then who did?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
What?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What do you want?
What's what?
Yes...What is it?
I know a nice island.
Yeah...I have to get away.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
He wants to apologise.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
What is it?
I told you, I work for him.
Riuji?
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
That's twenty feet high.
Come on.
If he was able, what would he say.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
But you did it. It was you.
He told me what to do.
It was you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
You are, I've seen you.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
Do something!
He can't help us.
We just don't stop.
Now what?
I knew it. I told him.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Her?
Kiss her you fool.
You're gonna laugh.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Aren't you a little optimistic?
I'll come back for you.
Just like that?
Escape.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Don't worry.
I love you too.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
I've never met anyone like you.
Now what?
What?
How?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
For you.
Why did you, then?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
It was my choice.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Can't you do something?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
What?
Nothing we can do.
You can say that again. What do we do?
What a mess.
Why?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Now what?
That I really don't know.
What did you tell them?
They asked about you.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Are you alright?
What'd...you forget?
I can't fly it.
What happened?
Sure I can, can't I?
Can you?
Why not?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
This going to work?
So do I.
You coming along?
I know the territory.
You've  been there?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
Chiang Cho?
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
What?
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Why'd you ask him.
Oh.
I asked him.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
What?
Hong Kong.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Where what?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Get us one.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
How?
We figure out if it's in here.
Now what?
He plays it all the time.
What?
Then where's the chip.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Beats me.
Where we going?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
And you?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
And Dieter.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Who was?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
What's Gruner like?
You think I'm like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Oh sure.
You don't believe me.
Get your things.
Hiroshima.
What is it?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Got to trust someone.
How do you know you can trust me?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
One chip?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
What'd he steal?
We're very close.
He must be a good friend.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
What's he done?
You know where he went?
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
I'm just on vacation.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
This business is over.
Why?
I'm leaving too.
Food doesn't agree with me.
You're leaving.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You did.
Who did?
No.
He didn't.
No, he didn't do that.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Last night?
Were you working for him last night?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
You work for Ryuji?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Why did they leave?
There's not much to tell.
What did you tell them?
They kidded me a little.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
What do you mean?
Who else is interested in me?
You seemed interesting.
Why?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why did you stay with me?
Why didn't you tell me?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you leave?
Why'd you run off?
Joe! What happened to you?
That depends...
And you, what do you like?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
How often they come here?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Hires you for what?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Is that Ryuji?
Trans Ocean Travel.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Who do you work for?
...Naw. Made that up.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Just Okay...
You're doing...Okay.
And how'm I doing?
You're talking to me.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You did.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Why do you do it?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
You talk to yourself.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
That you're not crazy.
Promise you what?
Are you alright?
You are.
Can I help?
I am sort of scattered.
As if your mind's not all there.
Disinterest?
...and sort of...disinterest.
It's not apparent.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
...I...don't know.
Why?
I waited for you.
Me still. They left you alone?
You again.
I just work for the travel firm.
And you?
Yes, of course.
You mean from it.
...Rene.
Wait. What's your name?
Like there's someone else here.
What way?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
What's so funny?
Without what?
Let you leave without it.
Do what?
I can't do that?
Haven't seen you around.
...right here too.
And you.
Oh...I can't. Business.
Dinner...tonight.
Where?
I'll be right there.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Blake said that?
Yes?
The poet...something he said...
Blake?
...Blake
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
No. No one to speak of.
Is someone else here?
...I'm looking for someone.
What do you do about what?
I don't know.
What about the others.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Why'd you invite me here?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why are you on to him?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
Excuse me?
...Piece of mind.
What could you find in this place?
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Thanks.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
A drink...
Is there anything else?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Yes.
Tear it apart?
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Could I have it, please.
Just one. The back up.
It will be fine. You have another.
It is?
It's alright.
The experiment. The danger...
Why not?
You can't take that.
Why?
Wait.
No?
It doesn't hurt.
It will.
It'l be alright.
Ow?...
Perfectly.
The other working.
Yes.
This the only spare?
Thank you.
Right there.
What about Al...
So we better get started.
It'l take months.
Whoever took it does.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Too much.
What does he know?
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Poor bastard.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
In the backyard.
Where?
I heard them.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
Instant rice...?
I'll take some.
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Okay.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
For reading.
Yeah? What for?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
What's new?
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, honey.
There's Dad, on TV.
Yes, baby?
Mom.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Yeah.
That remote control thing?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
You got a deal. 
Three hours.
How long?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Lowell?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Yeah. Catch you later.
Are you all right?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
What? Forget it.
Push it.
Monday.
When's your deadline?
I'll be there.
P.J.'s.
Sure. Where?
We gotta hook up.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
Good.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Sure.
Get me Wigand.
What was that about?
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
When's the air date?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Alright, alright.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
I don't know what he was thinking.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Shit...
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
What do you mean, what's it do?
What does that do?
Okay.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Oh, I love that stuff.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
What are you cooking?
How about you?
Maybe later.
Do you want more rice?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
What the hell are you doing?
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
Then what are you going to do?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
So, what are you going to do?
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You're exaggerating!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Lunch?
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
And what are you implying?
Before you go...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
No, I'm not...
I'm afraid you are.
I'm not touching my film...
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
That computer has everything...
...my files! Personal correspondence...
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
What caliber is your gun?
A gun? Yes.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Catch ya' later.
Okay. 
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
What about you, you got a crew already?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Hey, Lowell.
Debbie...
"Mike?"
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
How grave?
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Are you sure?
No, no, we're fine...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Come again?
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Call me back in ten.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Catch you later.
Hi, baby.
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
How are you, Jim?
Hey, Lowell.
No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Lowell?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
You ready...?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Why?
You're sure you want to do this?
Yeah?
Okay.  Lowell?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Hello?
Yes... Jeffrey.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
That's for food.
What's the difference...
Use the bathroom.
Where should I wash them?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
I'm doing an interview.
...taping?  What are you taping?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
What's going on?
No, thank you.
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
Thomas Sandefur...
Why? Who said?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
I don't understand.
I didn't want to leave it there...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
That's my stuff from the office...
Right now?
Soy sauce...
What do you need at the store?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Uh, what are those boxes?
Try the car.
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Is there any more rice...?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I can take her.
Yes.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes"?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Did you say Berman?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Who's calling?
Thank you, Bob.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
No, you do not.
I got perspective.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Jeffrey...
Jeffrey Wigand...
Oh, baby...
I'm alone on this...
What are you and Mike going to do?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What?!
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What's wrong?
I have to take a shower.
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Hello? Yeah...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
No classes this morning?
Let me call you back...
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Oh, my God.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Is it too late?
Who is this?
...you fucked me!
Yeah...
All right. See you...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Yeah, I'm here.
Okay. Thank you.
Alright?
Yeah.
It would be better if he called us.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
That's right...
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
I'll call you then.
Area code 212-555-0199.
Alright.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Everything interests me.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Mike... in my...
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Give me a break!
Oh, please, Mike...
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, lots.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Did I get you up?
I think it was a disgrace.
Alright. What did you think?
I disappeared on you?
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Yeah.
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I'm with Don on this.
What?
Lowell!
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Lowell.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
What?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Good.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
Who are these people?
Oh, man.
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Thank you for saying that...
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
So, is everything okay?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
What do you mean?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What's this?
No shit.
Hardly new news.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
Yeah.
You eating with us?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
We're there.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
What I've seen... I've liked.
How have you liked your stay?
Yeah... Thank you.
Coffee?
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You try and have a good time.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Where are you, anyway?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
You greased the rails!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You manipulated me into this...!
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
I told the truth... I told the truth.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
That's not the point.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
ABC...?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
What?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
She sued you for back payments of child support?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
I told the truth!
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
No? No, what?
No.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
What?!
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
No. I mean since whenever...
You mean... since this morning?
What's changed?
I don't know what to do.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Yeah, great.
You attract a crowd.
Did you have a good day?
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I heard.
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
Lowell, I can't afford --
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
I'll call them, Lowell.
Good. But Jeff...
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
Jeff...
They do this with impunity!
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Excuse me. Yeah...
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I don't think you really understand --
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Yes.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
No.
You believe that?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
Why?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
You charge by the hour?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Next to your father?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Tempura...
What did you get us?
It's okay.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Hello. You there
It's obvious, isn't it?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
...okay.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Good.  You have kids?
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
You okay?
The new place? New.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Seven dwarfs?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Like what?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
They should be.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
What do...
Good. I want to talk to you.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
Fuck you, too!
What are you talking about? Where are you?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
If you want to do it.
Should I just take the documents now?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
How much would I get paid?
Did work.
Did work.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Far as you go where?
...but that's as far as I go...
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
I know what I have to know.
Like what? Your sign?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Black, black...
How do you like your coffee? Black?
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Who's that?
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
I can't say that!
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
He doesn't seem to be listening...
What's happening?!
Hello, can you hear me now?
What?
What about now?
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Did he hear you?
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Where you staying now?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Liane has filed for divorce...
What do you mean there is no family?
There is -- there is no family.
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
What are you talking about?
You called me.
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
Well, what do you really think, though?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
She's okay.
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
Just give me an example...
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Right.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"I would bet on it."
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Poor communication skills.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Most certainly.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
You're gonna get your fix...
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
A delivery device for nicotine.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Object!
It acts as a...
Object to the form!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form of the question!
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Jail?
When should we do this?
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Hello.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
That's why we hire scientists...
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
You threatening my family, now, too?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Is that a threat?
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
Chapter and verse.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Seven...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
They hate each other --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
He --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Well, I wouldn't say --
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
You did good, Massey!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Howard!
Baby. You are so HOT!
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Here. Got pictures.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
What part?
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
-- and we are sure...
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
What a touching story.
I had no idea until after, but --
No!
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
After you, Doll.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
You're in a rush.
Here's her picture...
Is that... one person?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Who do you want me to kill?
Excuse me?
Who's the pigeon?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Who's the pigeon?
Triple!
That's his lawyer.
No...
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Mr. Dumbarton.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Sustained.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
Mr. Massey?
We rest, Your Honor.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Grounds?
Objection, your honor!
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Marylin! What have I done?
Huh?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Who was that?
So, that's good, right?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Yes.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
What do you mean, was.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Yes?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
What?
My God.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
It's your move, Miles.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
You have the pre-nup?
I have it.
Well... I'm still...
Asian? No.
Is she Asian?
Thanks, buddy.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
He's the wrong man.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Got any symptoms?
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
I should be in therapy.
You're in check.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
We did not.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Set one side for Bel Air.
It was a gift from a client.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
No frown lines.  New watch?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
What the hell is Botox?
You want Botox?
I don't need it.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
What is your husband's profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
I'll be right back.
It sounded like a bell.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Is Tong older than Ming?
I said yes.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
It's about time.
You're vulnerable.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I begged you to have a baby!
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Why do you think she did it?
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
You like kids.
No.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Ruth Rabino.
So who'd you hire?
I thought so.
Sweet.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Pre-Castro.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Murder!
Murder?
Income tax evasion?
Forgery? Fraud?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
It's not something I wanted either.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Hello Miles.
Hello Marylin.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
That's true.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
You were going to have this thug...?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Wait! He works for YOU?
It's okay Joe.
Marylin!
It's a no go, Joe.
You do? You do love me?
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
I fell in love Miles.
Please! Leave the house.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
No buts. Now. Out.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
You have to leave the house immediately!
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Marylin?
Hello?
That's marriage.
That's blackmail.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Meaning my house.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You can't prove anything.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Those are gifts.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
What kind of "stuff?"
STUFF.  Got a light?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I want to nail you ass.
What do you want?
Comfy!
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I don't believe you have "things."
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
May I come in?
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Miles? You're scaring me.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
You don't like me?
I bet.
I have a surprise for you.
Hello Marylin.
Hi.
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
Miles.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Fabric and fringe.
Good.  Are those foods?
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Honey, I could sit...
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
But?
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
Oh Miles!
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
I have a watch.
I know.
I don't have a ring!
Yes. Again.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Do you want to sleep on it?
No.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
You do?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Did you just propose to me?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Huh?
I want to be your -- your wife.
I want... I want to...
What is it Miles?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Friends?
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
No.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
No, we're not!
We're damaged goods.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
Your mother was.
And here I thought my mother was...
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
She held that against you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She didn't love you?
She never particularly cared for me.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Hmmm...
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Me. Yes.
Is that you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
From a -- girlfriend.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Thank you.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Okay Miles.
No. Don't stop.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Screw you, asswipe!
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Marylin? When did I say...?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Yes? Marylin?
Miles?
Hello?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
To victory.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Have you tried the duck?
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Howard is a beautiful person.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
No, that's not all.
So I hear. Is that all?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
But why him?
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Marylin! Listen to me.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
He's passionate.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Getting married.
Absolutely.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Oh, for the love of...
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
He'll regret this.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
And you've always loved him?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Well, don't look at mine!
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Gotcha.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
He wants a reconciliation.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
No. I haven't. Have you?
You just haven't met the right person.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You don't believe in it.
No.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
I know you do.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
I told you. I was hungry.
Why would you be here?
How do you know?
But you don't agree?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
What does your lawyer think?
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Not yet.
Did you see the tape?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Isn't everything?
I assume this is on Rex?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
These are yours.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
How nice.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
Sometimes I forget.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
You have some?
Do you need a Tagamet?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Marylin.
Hello, Rex.
Dogs?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Marylin?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
We are. And it's winding down.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
So. Now what?
He was right, wasn't he?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
You used his credit card.
Forgery and Fraud?
Please!
Is this a lover?
Jesus.
Who's that?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
I was devastated. Of course.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I guess.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
So what?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
But you're going through with it?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
What?
Right.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Is this Ming?
I want to be exposed.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Hello Miles.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
You're not...
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Shit.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
So where are you now?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
I'm dying.
Every week --
Oh, God!
Lilly's up.
He has a reputation for being tough.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Well what does he want?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I wish I had your discipline.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
We do have a man for you.
Maybe.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Who's she?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Do you know him?
Of Massey Myerson?
Miles Massey.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Wow.
She did a Harriman.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
Excuse me?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Yes?
Wait. I know you.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
She's here now.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Mr. Massey --
When you have a moment.
Herb wants to see me?
We've outlined a settlement...
Where does that leave us?
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
And it's good!
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
I don't have a pre-nup
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Did Marylin end up with money?
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
...arty farty!
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Heh heh.
Ha Ha.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
That's delusional.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client has ruled that out.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
What?!
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Maybe I should reconsider my...
In anticipation of making you sick.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She always looked out for me.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
What's Kirshner?
Well -- is that possible?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Nothing?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Video.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
I'm not sure.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I don't know. I can assume...
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Ah.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
But then... But then...
Mm.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Now Rex.
Thank you.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Rex, please.
Mr. Rexroth.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Extinguish?
-- the coin?
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Do you have it?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Miles.
Wrigley?
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
She owes me a meal.
What...?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
HA!
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Miles -- why so angry?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Berry spoons.
What are they?
What do you think?
Is she going through with it?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
No. You're not.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I am very sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Sorry.
Wrigley!
What the fuck...?
Video.
And she has...?
Nothing.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Who's "Patty."
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Hi, Sweetie.
Mother?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
And only two are hers.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
Maybe next time.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Muriel Rumsey.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Who's Rex's guy?
Three is not Farrow.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
How is she?
Yes, sir?
OhMary
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Do you love her?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
That's an evasion.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
We'll go into that some other time.
You're a peculiar chap.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
Who said anything about a reward!
The reward.
What ten thousand?
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Yes, I knowbut
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Come in. Sit down.
Yeah.
Mr. Warne?
Nono. What the deuce do I want to
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain.
"I found a million dollar baby"
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
I suppose so.
Are you going to see him?
I'm sorry you read it.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Oh, please, Dad
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, nono.
Why? Do you know him? 
Peter Warne! 
Yes. Peter Warne.
Is that his name?
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
No, I'll go through with it.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
I'd like to have a talk with him.
I don't know.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
He's marvelous!
Fine man to fall in love with.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Well!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Ridiculous!
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Oh, come now
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Who is he?
No.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
On the road.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Oh, no.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Nothing. 
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Stunt?
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
I knocked several times.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Ellie
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Please don't shout.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You only met him once .
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
What've you got against King Westley?
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll get it annulled.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
South America!
South America.
Where are you taking me?
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You ought to know why. Because
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
I might.
Why don't you put me in chains?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
What's this about not eating?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
If you really mean it, I will.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Why should she? After all
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Lower the boats!
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
I haven't the slightest idea.
What happened?
Yes, of course.
We've done that already.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Yes, sir.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Sock her!
What would you like to have me do?
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
You talk as if
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Why; naturally, I
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
Amateurs!
They're practically all the same, sir. 
What do they say?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Any others?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Thanks.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
What happened to your money?
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
But the lady says
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
No.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
. . . turn."
All right, let it go.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Yeah?
Driver!
You win!
Oh, yeah?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Oh, yeah?
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Ohthe papers
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Huh?
What do you think you're doing!
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Whadda you want!
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Same to you.
Congratulations.
You bet I did.
I hope you got your money.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
You're forgetting you're married.
I love you.
Better go back to your bed.
Maybe.  Suresure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd  Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Me?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why not?
Nope.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Yeah, swell.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
That's swell!
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
What about money?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Any luck?
Darling!
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
A black eye. 
What'd you give him for the car?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
What happened?
Come on! come on! 
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come onget in.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Eat a carrot.
Why not? I'm hungry.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
We don't need forty cars.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
What for?
You might give me a little credit.
Mind your own business.
What're you going to do?
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Here comes a car!
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Amazing.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Clever.
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
Oh, no!
You think it's simple, huh?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You're an expert, I suppose.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
What if nobody stops for us?
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
I hate the horrid stuff.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Raw?
Carrots.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Hayin my teeth.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
Hitch-hiking.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Really?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
What are you thinking about?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Try me.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What?
Sure.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
was so scaredthat it scared
But what!
wasbut
Thought you were hungry!
I don't want it now.
Here. Eat your head off.
knowbut
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter 
What's the matter?
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What!
Well, take them off.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
What?
Peter
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
This looks like the best spot.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he
You're prejudiced.
Not a one.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
That's silly.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Yes.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
You're crazy.
Of course it is.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Okay. Hang on to these.
No.
Aren't you afraid of me?
I'm following you.
Yeah.
To New York?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Why, haven't you?
It takes money to buy food.
What do you meanstarvation?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Not as long as I'm alive.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
What's the matter?
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Yes.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
I better go over and see her.
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
I refuse to resign!
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
You always want to run everything.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Next week "East Lynne."
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
You weren't so bad yourself.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Well, you were!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
What are you talking about?
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Detectives!
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Thanks, professor.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Oh. Is that how you met him?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Santa Claus?
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Um. You're doing all right.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Yeah?
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
No. No. It's too good a story.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Must be the Spring.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Nope. No complaints.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
High time you got back.
I'll find it myself.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Where is the shower?
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Heretake mine.
Like this. I have no robe.
Like what?
I can't go out like this.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Outside!
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage. 
Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Here
The pleasure is all mine.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Who are you?
Not at all. 
Do you mind putting out the light?
Smart aleck!
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Your ego is colossal.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
Are you talking to me!
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Shut up!
Now, just a minuteyou can't
You're on a budget from now on.
That's none of your business.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
You have your nerve!  Here, boy!
Beat it! 
Of course I do. What do you mean
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Here, boy!
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
I never thought of that.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
What for?
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
That's right. You didn't.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
You must have me confused with
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
What are you talking about?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
I found it on the seat.
My ticket?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Yes.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
I don't want it reported!
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
What am I going to do now?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
What happened?
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Are you talking to me?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
Driver!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
I beg your pardon!
Won't I ever see you again?
Not interested. 
No harm in your coming to see us.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
You sound like a hobo.
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.
Do you know?
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Well, I am.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
Whome?  Want to see me?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Come here, you little fool!
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
I'm out! I'm out!

Why, you bully. I believe you would.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Whatever you say, darling.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
You bet we did.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Sorry, Miss.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Eight o'clock tonight.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Left twenty minutes ago.
Where's the bus to New York?
Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
When does the bus leave?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
But can't you wait until morning
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Why, he'll be back.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Isn't he here?
Yesif he is your husband.
Husband?
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Get out!
SorryI didn't mean to
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Just your imagination.
I'm hungry.
Eight o'clock.
What time is it?
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Yes?
I've been thinking about you.
What's that?
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
Oh, excuse me. 
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
The dame's too smart for him.
Yeah!
I said, the old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
The old man's screwy!
Thanks.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Yeah.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah? Where?
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
What's up?
Don't accept any more.
Yes.
Collect?
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Huh?
Mr. Gordon
Thanks, Joe.
When you sober upcome in and see me.
Yeah, where am I?
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Okay, pete. 
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Well, I'll be
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Yeah.
You!
I am, Joe.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I'd put you there myself.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Who's she gonna marry?
Well, I got it, Joe.
If it's on the level.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
You're drunk.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Huh?
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
What!
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Don't "Joe" me.
Joe, listen
Get out!
Wait a minute, GordonI
Get out of here!
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up.
I ain't got a hat.
What?
ain't got a hat
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
I dunno.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
A trumpet?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
What do you reckon that's for?
Yeah?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Collect.
Collect?
Send it collect.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Mush. Mush.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
You send telegrams here?
Yes, Ma.
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Not a minute!
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Thenyou'll have to git !
Oh!!
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
See that. They're gone!
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Who?
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
I don't trust him.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Mebbe.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
Sure. Anything you say.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
No.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
You love them, don't you?
Yeah. Just babies.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Orange, New Jersey.
Where do you live?
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Whyno
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Huh?
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
I can use a smart guy like you.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Five G'sor I crab the works.
What's on your mind?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Why?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Yeahwouldn't it?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
That's right.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Thanks. 
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Say, Buddy
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
What's up?
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Wife?
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
What's the idea?
There's a seat over there for you.
Huh?
Hey, you!
Well, you're two up on me now. 
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Not one word.  That's an order.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
There were no phone records.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Recall any names?
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
And Oswald?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Did he pay?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
What was his voice like?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Street cats?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Right.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Who?
You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
No, I'm not...
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Bill.
You're not digging.
Keep saying what?
You know you keep saying that.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
You, Numa?
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
What do you think, Lou?
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
What's the other name?
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Go on, Willie.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Did he pay you for this?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Yeah.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
There's a word - orders.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Where you going, boss?
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Can you get some sworn statements?
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
But why?
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
Gee, thanks boss.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
What's it look like, Nick?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Why?
I did.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
No, I did not.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
...Oswald?
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
What do you mean?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
...give me protection?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
It leads farther than that.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
You still questioning any Cubans?
What did they...
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Calm down, Dave, what?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave?
You know damn well who it is.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Then who killed the President?
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
What about Ruby?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
And Shaw?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Who was paying you, Dave?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Why?  What's wrong?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
And then Sunday?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Why Galveston?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
There were admirals.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
No.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I had the cause of death.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's our case!
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
What?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
I'm scared.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Are we going away, Daddy?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Dad, look what I drew.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
...you heard echoes.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
I want the truth.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
No, you don't!
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Four to six.
How many shots you say you heard?
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
Aren't you being a little hard?
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
I don't believe it!
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Nonsense.  What next?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Please answer the question.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Let me show you his picture. 
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
David Ferrie.
Who?
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
A Willie O'Keefe?
No.
A Perry Russo?
No.  Never heard of him.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
I wouldn't imagine where.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
I'm not sure I understand.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Huh?
They killed him, honey.
I don't think so, Jim...
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
And if you're wrong?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Get a hold of yourself.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
What?
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Did they live?
It's going to get worse, honey.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
My sympathies.
Tough day.
Hi.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Honey, you all right? 
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Well... yeah.
For sexual purposes?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
We need him back.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Allen Dulles?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
The Warren Commission call him?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Who?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
No.
You know who the mayor was?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
How many men?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Between six and seven seconds.
Time?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
Goddamn Sam!
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Can we find her?
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
What are you driving at, boss?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Post Office.
Take a look across the street.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
I know David - a strange character.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Oh no!... How bad?
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
What's wrong, Lou?
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
No, it can't!
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Are they?  Why would they?
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
It never did. 
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
His name?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Ever ask him?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
...and your General?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Well, thanks for coming.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Yes.
Jim Garrison?
You're so naive, mister.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
The assassination, Jack?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
And Oswald?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Where is Banister in all this?
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Was he there often?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
You have other information?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
How much more?
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
Never touched me.
And he never hit you before?
More than ten years.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
She's the best damn witness we have!
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
And what would I have to do?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
That's it.
That's all you've had all this time?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
How many men are working with you on this?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Germany.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Splendid, love to see them.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Uh huh.
Do you walk home?
Yes.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
And how tall are you?
Six.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
That sounds fun.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Virginia.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Yes?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
What are they?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Oh, that's not a problem.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Thanks.
Not a problem.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
This looks pretty good on me.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Can I help you?
I won't forget.
Won't forget?
I'll call her.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Yes, Max, I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I understand.
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
I understand.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
But then you told her you were home.
I know. That's why I went.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
Course you didn't.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Go ahead.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Uh-huh.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
What's the problem?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
A bit.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
I need a favor.
What?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What'd ya mean?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Three years.
How old is that machine gun shit?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
You.
Who?
You were there for me.
Who was there for your ass?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I found out.
How'd you know where he was?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Why were you with him?
In his inside coat pocket.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Sure.
Can I have a word with you?
What time do you have to be there?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
We are. Don't worry about it.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
She knows it's my case?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
What's she willing to give us?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she want?
She almost sounds scared.
She sound scared?
She wants to make a deal.
What's going on?
Hey, Jackie.
Great, you're here.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
You got a good lawyer?
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
But you're not going to stop her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
What's her name?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
Fine.
How was your flight?
Can you do it or not?
You don't want much, do you?
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
But now you're telling us now you do.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Help us do what?
Thanks.
Take your time.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
That's my diet shit.
What's this?
Beauty products.
What's in it?
My pocketbook.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Help yourself.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
I'm not a loser.
Arrest me.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'm not saying another word.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
This is your money?
Suspicion of what?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Are you scared of me?
I'm just tired in general.
I thought you were tired of your business?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Wanna go?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Madrid or Barcelona?
Spain.
Where're you going?
You'll get over that.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
We're partners.
I know.
I never lied to you.
I didn't say you did.
I didn't use you, Max.
Not after they're dead.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
That's Ordell's.
I told him I might.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
What's he doing?
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I'm sure.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I hesitated taking that much.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
Less ten percent.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
He's already there.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
What do you tell Nicolet?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Why?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Tell him you want to see him?
Uh-huh.
Set him up.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
It's not that simple.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Ray wants him.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
He's liable to shoot you.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How'd you find out?
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
In a dress.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
What if he checks it?
In the bag underneath.
Where's the rest of it?
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
It'll be more than that.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Do you think they bought it?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
You're rationalizing.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
The feds. It's evidence.
What if I've figured a way?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Which one?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
More or less.
And is that it?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Did you do it that night?
That's my job.
You do that?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
What do you do when he comes home?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
The day you got me out of jail?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
When did you decide?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Why?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
You're avoiding the question.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
What about you Max?
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
He tries to act cool.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
You know some interesting people.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
Has he hinted around?
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
I see.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
You think he's got a thing for you?
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
I called you last night.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
He was here?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Will Ordell go for that?
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
Right around here, in the food court.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
You don't actually do it that way?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
They seem to like the idea.
You talk them into it?
I go back to work tomorrow.
What're you, a bag lady?
I don't care.
How old's Annette?
I'm old enough to be her father.
Why?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Who was your girl before Annette?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
And Annette's it for you?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Does it happen to all men?
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
How was it?
"American President"
What'd ya see?
Catching a movie.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
I walked right past you.
Surprise.
Well, hello.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Fifteen thousand.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Does something else worry you?
Yeah.
Bigger?
My ass ain't the same.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
It's different with men.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
How'd you feel about it?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Really?
It's not really something I think about.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
You're not old. You look great.
How do you feel about getting old?
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
How do you get it out?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Why?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
We talked.
What?... What'd you do?
He came by.
He called you?
He told me last night.
How'd you find that out?
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
Are you?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
It's nice.
'74, I think.
'76?
The Delfonics.
Who is this?
Uh-huh.
This is pretty.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
It looks nice.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Sure.
Want to hear some music?
Yeah.
Somebody loan it to you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
What, I couldn't hear you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Black's fine.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You get a chance to use it?
I am. Have a seat.
If you're having some.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
What'dya think?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Cash poor?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
He's got that kinda money?
With ten thousand? Nine.
How many trips did you make?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
It was the other guy who busted me.
He's the one who wants you.
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
No, you didn't. What branch?
I didn't?
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
Ordell pick up his bond?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
What did they want to know?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
Sure.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
Shit.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
What have they told you?
I am, as a matter of fact.
You're not tired of it?
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Was she helpful?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
What's your brand?
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
You gain weight?
Great.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Why does it need to be dark?
That doesn't sound dark.
It's kind of a sports bar
Is it dark?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
I'd love one, but not there.
I thought you might want a drink?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I don't think so.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
In cash.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
You're serious?
Can I see your I.D.?
I gave you my card there.
Who do you think I am?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Okay.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
If I don't cooperate?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
What if I plead guilty?
I beg your pardon?
Who's side are you on?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
He say is a surprise.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Yes'm.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Not every day?
Most of the times.
Do you live together?
He say we like the same thing as married.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Do you think I took some of that money?
What about you?
What about me?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
So what happens now?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I thought you were watching him.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
If it'll make you happy.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
I have no idea.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
Not in the fitting room.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
What did you do after that?
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
Where's the bag she gave you?
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
But you didn't do that.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I thought I did.
Si.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
That would be one point of view.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
Yes. All those things are true.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Uh-huh.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Ever been tempted?
I never have. It's not my money.
You didn't count it?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
You said that the last time.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Uh-huh.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
She didn't say.
Was she there?
Uh-huh.
She told you that?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
What did you say?
I'm sure that was the idea.
And splittin' with her?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
What's her story?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
Who's the other one?
Not yet.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
What for?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Not really.
You talk to him?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
You two meet?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
A Broadway shopping bag.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
I thought you were going to let this one through.
I'm recording this.
What are you doing?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
How can you help us?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Then how do you know he sells guns?
No.
You ever see him sell guns?
He sells guns.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
You never asked me if I did or not.
Oh, so now you know him?
If I'm working, I can help you.
You know what we want.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
We can look into that.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
Can I smoke?
We'll just be a minute.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
You planted that shit on me.
I know what it looks like.
What the fuck is that shit?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
Yeah?
Oh, Miss Brown?
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
Thanks.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
You betcha.
Do you got something for me?
It looks good on you.
Yeah, do you like it?
Are you getting that black suit?
Hi, Melanie.
Jackie?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Keep it between us girls?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Dreaming.
You think I'm kidding?
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
Kinda.
You already knew that?
Beaumont Livingston?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
He said he didn't know about it.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
What were you two fighting about?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
How long you been with Ordell?
Gimme one anyway.
Uh-uh.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Killian's.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Sure.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Buy ya a beer?
Oh, hi.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Who's paging you?
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
Where you gonna be during all this?
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Designer clothes.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
What does she think she's gettin?
She don't know shit about the money.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Man, I don't like that part.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
I was there, I saw her do it.
How do you know she did that?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I need to talk to you alone.
Drink?
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
What'd you care?
Who?
Uh-huh.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
I can do that.
Plus the same deal as before.
I'll give ya ten.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Managers get ten percent.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Can you cover that?
So we need two people, two women.
That's the idea.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
No, I give it to someone else first.
But you don't?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
Yeah, I think a woman.
If you want.
A woman.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Who?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
That's a good idea.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
What did they say?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
It's true, isn't it?
You told them that?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
They already know it's you.
You told em? You told em it's me?
I told them.
How the fuck they know that?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I do okay.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
It's a cockatoo.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
The Cockatoo Inn.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Yeah.
All your money's in Mexico.
I got a problem...
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
Yeah?
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
Baby, I didn't --
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
I just came here to talk.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Go sit over in that chair.
I understand woman, damn!
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
What the hell you doin'?
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
What do you think it is?
They told me.
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Yeah?
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
I knew it.
Beaumont Livingston.
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
And what was your answer?
They asked.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
For what?
Sure.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Yeah.
Got some o.j.?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
I was expecting you. Come in.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
Okay, Lou-is.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
You sure?
This one.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
You sure?
Yeah, down the end.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
I'm carrying it.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Lemme have the bag.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
What are you doin'?
Are you sweating?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
All right already.
We're leaving now!
...and just take it from him.
Uh-huh?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
And your point is?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Uh-huh?
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
You live with him.
Please.
Does that bother you?
He went to meet that stewardess.
No.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Yeah.
Is it dead?
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Sure.
Wanna fuck?
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
That sounds like a problem.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Must of made quite an impression.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Who's arm is that?
About five years ago.
You lived in Japan, when?
I lived there for about nine months.
You been to Japan?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Did you ever go I one?
I don't like dancing.
C'mon, don't lie.
No.
Were you a disco guy?
We had done time together already.
With Ordell?
Detroit.
Where were you?
No.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
So where did you go?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Were you a disco girl?
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
I thought you were sixteen.
Yeah.
You're fourteen years old here?
Fourteen.
The roller disco one.
Which one?
No thanks.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
It's a diet thing?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
What's a Metrix?
Want a Metrix?
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
You okay?
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Is it ready to go?
Really, I'm impressed.
Bank robbery.
What for?
Uh-huh.
Four years?
Two months shy of four years.
How long?
Susanville.
Where at?
Four days ago.
When did you get out of jail?
Sure.
Want a hit?
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I can sit through it once.
It's boring, isn't it?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
How am I supposed to know that?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Max Cherry.
You gonna tell me who it was?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Tell me.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
What?
Jesus Christ.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Maybe the Feds got it.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
It's in there.
What'd you shoot her with?
Pull the car over.
Fuck you for asking me that.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
That's right.
Where you shot her.
We went to the parking lot.
Then what?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
How long was she in there?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Came outta where?
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How much it there?
Where's the rest of it?
What?
Louis?
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
In the chest and stomach.
Where did you shoot her?
Pretty sure.
So you're sure she's dead.
Uh-huh.
You shot her twice?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You couldn't just hit her?
You know how she is.
Couldn't talk to her?
Twice. In the parking lot.
You shot Melanie?
I shot her.
So what, you left her there.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
Not now, pick me up.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
Did you get it?
It's Louis.
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Uh-huh.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
What does that mean?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Yep.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
She believed you?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
What's your relationship?
Sure.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
How much is there?
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
I didn't look like a bum.
I follow.
So we on the same page then?
Yeah.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
What did he do?
An employee I had to let go.
Who was Beaumont?
That was Beaumont.
Who was that?
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
I'm in my underwear.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
C'mon in.
Uh-huh.
You're outside?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
The moon -- I dunno
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I dunno.
Guess where I am?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Whatcha watchin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
Okay.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
What do I do?
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Which one is for the car?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
I'm going to wait in the car.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Then what?
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
That's good money.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
Are you serious?
As low as two.
What's your cost?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Who's your partner?
Thanks, Baby.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
They don't have your winning personality.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Have fun.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Watcha gonna see?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
I'm going out for a few hours.
You better be, motherfucker.
Yes.
You sure?
No.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Yeah.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Uh-huh.
My money's in that office, right?
I know where to turn.
Turn left.
I know where it is.
It's the next street.
She will.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
She's all alone.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Uh-huh.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
You expect me to just walk in there?
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Call her, tell her the combination.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Have her bring the money here.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
That I gotta see.
She was afraid.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She's been there since Thursday night.
And where's Jackie?
My office.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
This place stinks.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
In a way, yes.
And you did that to protect my interest?
All I did was walk out with it.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
Well, give it to me then.
Uh-huh.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
How the fuck did he find me?
Winston found you.
How'd you find me?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
That's all?
Git your ass in here.
I'm alone.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
I thought you might be asleep.
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
You still there?
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
She got off, huh?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
You know who this is?
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
What's up with this shit.
Is that what I think it is?
Where is it?
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Was she?
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Beaumont worked for you.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
What does she do for you?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Did the police contact you?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Hear what?
You didn't hear?
What?
Somebody already did.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
It still sounds high.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
I got some more business for ya.
I can see that. Why?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Comfortable?
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Yes.
Hey, Max.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Now I need you to count your money.
House.
House or apartment?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
I need your name and address.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Haven't a clue.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
You don't say.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Livingston, huh?
Beaumont Livingston.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Getting there.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
What's his full name?
You think you could do that?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Who's it for? A relative?
I know that.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
It's in my bag.
You have it with you?
Gonna have to put up cash.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Yeah.
He's a big one. You two tight?
That's Winston. He works here.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
How can I help you?
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
No problem.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
I was gonna tell you...
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
'Ola!
We're back.
It's Beaumont.
Who is it?
You know it's for you.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
I'll give you his beeper.
Give me his home number.
He's around.
He leave town?
He ain't here right now.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
No! Oh God.
Dream on!
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
It's all been a dream.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Remember?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
Let me out of here!
What isn't happening?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Then what are you doing here?
I'm alive.
What are you then?
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Take me home.
Where do you want to go?
Get me out of here.
Like Della.
Well, how do I look?
Just to see you. That's all.
What do you want?
I see.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Della?
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
It's fun.
No, thanks.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
No, don't. But thanks.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
I'm okay.
Are you all right?
Hello, Sam.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Me, too.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Grass never did that to me.
Yeah, ever since that ...
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
How do you know?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
LET GO!
What do you want from me?
Daddy. Let go.
Stop!!!!
You're hurting me!
Oh God!
Daddy!
Just my luck.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Oh, terrific.
Short? It's ended.
It's short, huh?
You know, you got a strange line here.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
I could have told you that.
You have an unusual hand.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Hey, wait!
I'm hanging up.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Maybe the demons are real.
What are you talking about?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What do you mean?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
They're not interested, Jake.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
There's nothing to expose.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Well, try, huh.
It's hard to explain.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
That's right. We did.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Hello.
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Don't go.
Now what?
Wait ... Daddy.
Mom, it's ...
Tell your mother.
It's cold.
It was the window.
There was a bang.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Daddy, what was that noise?
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Used you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
You need ... a doctor.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I am.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
What else did he say, Jake?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
But the paper ...
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
Why do you say that?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
You think they're connected?
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
No. Not really ...
He say what they looked like?
A couple of weeks, I think.
How long had that been going on?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
He told me he was going to Hell.
What do you mean, demons?
I say you should get a shrink.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
Not me, buddy.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Shit!
... I've seen them, too.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Jake, you need to rest.
I'm walking, aren't I?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you doing?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
What? By myself?
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
I know.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
What?
I had this weird flash just then.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
Wiggle your toes.
I can't relax.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
You should go back to her.
She hates me, Louis.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She talk about the boys?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Sarah.
Who?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
What did she have to say?
A bit.
Her knee acting up?
I saw Sarah the other day.
What can I tell you?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
How do you know?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
Hell, you think I am?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
But I see them.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I need your insight, your intuition.
I don't know what to say.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Yes.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
No.  I see them.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Ah!
I haven't seen her in months.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Likewise.
It's good to see you.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Are you in the service?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Whataya mean, no record?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Jacob Singer.
What's your name?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
New? He's been here for years.
Carlson? Is he new here?
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Save me!
Jacob, what can I do?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Go to sleep.
She was good in bed, though.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
I don't want to know.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I'm not cold.
It's freezing.
What was that?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
No. Don't move me.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Who did?
They stole it.
Your back? Did you fall?
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
You know who I am.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
WHO ARE YOU?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Goddamn you!
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Oh God!
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
This isn't happening.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Where have they gone?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Sit down!
Where are they?
Sit down, Jake.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Don't be funny.
Where's West? New Jersey?
West.
Oh?  Where you going?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Mid-town mostly.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Then don't bug me.
You can have anything you want.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
I'm tired.
Jake, what is it?
I'm not upset.
You look upset.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You've lived with me for two years.
I don't know you.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
Why won't you answer me?
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
WHO ARE YOU?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What's going on?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Where have they gone?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Sit down.
Where are they?
Sit down, Jake.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
I love you when you're angry.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Please.
I promise.
Bullshit!
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I can waitress. I'm good.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Stick with me, kid.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
It's so hard to believe.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
What's gotten into you?
Me neither.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
How?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Who was that?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
It might be for me.
Don't!
I can do anything I want.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
I want to know. You tell me!
Stay away from me, Jez.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Let go!
Who else were you expecting?
Jezzie?
It's just me.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
I don't believe this.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
What's he talking about?
He said you didn't have one.
What? What do you mean?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Why didn't you call me?
While you were in the shower.
He did? When?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
How come? The army?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
Remember that.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
I know.
I love you, Jez.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
What?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
Are we in Brooklyn?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Am I home?
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Here. I'll do it.
Help me! Help me!
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Lie down!
Don't gimme that.
What kind of man are you?
I can't do it.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
That's your decision.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Coming here?
He's coming right over.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
What'd the doctor say?
Get your clothes off!
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Get your clothes off.
What the hell are you doin'?
The numbers stop at 107.
How high is that?
It's gone to the top.
What does it say?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Can't you stop it?
Hey, I'm here.
Show me Della!
Why? What for?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Where?
We're at Della's.
Where are we?
Oh, come on. It's early.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
You okay?
Come on. What were they, Jake?
They weren't human!
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
They're like demons, Jez.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
When was the last time I said a word?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Why do you bring her up?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
I enjoy crushing into you.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
What's wrong?
I'm going home.
How's it going?
Jake!
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
Ready?
I just want to look ...
I don't like things that make you cry.
Wait. Don't.
Gabe.
Is that the one who died?
Well, you didn't marry her.
Not to me.
She looked good then.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
What do you mean you can see?
Why you left.
What?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Lemme see.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
What's in here?
Jake, you are never out of your head!
I must have been out of my head.
The best.
And look what I got.
A good lay.
Yeah, but for what?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
I don't let anybody call me that.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
They're weird names.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
No. The little one.
Who? Jed?
Your kid dropped it off.
Thanks.  What's that?
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Jezzie, I can't see.
Did you look around the headboard?
I don't know.
Where'd you leave 'em?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
You up?
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
The room!
What do you mean?
What do you think?
Thanks.
That help?
Where to?
I moved the couch. That's all.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Where are you?
Where is the lamp?
Gee, thanks a lot.
I didn't want to wake you.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Jake, is that you?
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
I don't know what to say.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
No. I couldn't.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Well that's good to know.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
What's happening? Help me.
Just relax.
I can't move.
Pleasant dreams.
I think I'm falling asleep.
It's strong stuff.
One drop?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I don't know.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
What is it?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Never?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
You come here often?
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
So why tell me now?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
Who then?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
Like it was yesterday.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
The Ladder?
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Shows how much you knew.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Long time ago.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
If you're lucky.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
You got a nice tan, though.
Hot. Where do I sign?
How was Palm Springs?
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Where's Wong?
I know. That's why I'm asking.
They're awfully heavy.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I no from around here.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Help me!
Push 'em back.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
He'll never make it.
Total delirium.
He's burning up.
What?!
Dream on!
What is wrong with you?
Clear the area. This is an order!
We're not going to hurt you.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Please come quietly.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Help me!
Push 'em back.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Total delirium.
He's burning up.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
I'm sorry.
That's a lie. My family was here.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
I'm awake?
Lennox Hospital.
Where am I?
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
We're doing everything we can.
Call my chiropractor.
I'll page him.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
You come home with me.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
I don't know. I don't know.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
The army?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
Oh God. I know. I know.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Everywhere, like a plague.
You've seen them?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
What do you mean?
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I don't know what to do.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
Why not?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Who is?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Yeah.
You in trouble?
I don't know.
What's goin' on Paul?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
That black car?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
What's wrong?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I just need to talk.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Nope.
Still married, Jake?
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Count 'em on one hand.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
I work in a bakery.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
I need to see you.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
I need to see you, Jake.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Nothin' much.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
A long time.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
Paul Gruneger!
Speaking.
Jacob Singer?
Hello.
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Do you want me to get someone?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
How did it happen?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
A car accident.
Died?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Can I help you?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
On top of him?
Pour it in.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
He doesn't like it.
Is he all right?
Bring it in.
I have some ice from the machine.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
I don't have all day, kid.
Alright, asshole.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Oh, come on!
Yes it does.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
He's not part of the program.
Pause play.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Speaking of which, duck!
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
You got lucky.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
Punk?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Done?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
We made it?
Minimal.
I don't know. Nothing.
What?
His mother?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Can we blow it with just two?
We don't have a choice!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What's that?
No.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
What are you doing?!!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
It's locked!
Could you show a little compassion?!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Goodbye old friend.
We don't have time to argue!
We're not leaving Crutch!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Duck fuckers?
Get out of here!
Sergeant!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Rizzo did.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Bomb?
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
He came for me, I had to run!
Where the hell were you?!!
He....He...
Where have you been?!!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Okay that hurt.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
What?!
Uh-oh.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
Thorgan, suit up.
Goodbye, my love.
Let's move out!
Done!
Two more charges to go.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
What are you doing back?!!
Kay-Em!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Hey! I'm not ready.
They're back here.
I'll need system four converters.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
We're not supposed to do that.
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
The hull's imploding!
Shit!
I think I broke my arm.
Everyone okay?
Where'd you get the gun?
Better let me.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
You see that?
And you said high school was boring.
Nice touch.
Cool.
Creepy.
Hey, easy now.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Suit up.
Earth II.
And now we're all out of it.
It bought us some time.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Hurry!
I don't know!
Then what do we do?!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Where is...?
Thorgan? You coming?!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
How many?
We could convert fission transistors.
We'd need charges.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
What?
Sergeant!
But I didn't see...
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Yeah yeah. Got it.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
You got that right.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Not a chance.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Yllo, what's your head count?
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Wait a minute...I need...
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
My job.
What the hell are you doing?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
You're a teacher.
I am an expert!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
Get them in the lab!
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
We need weapons.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Where is he?
I'm with you kid.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Negative.
Kicker, anything?
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Fuckin A...
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Jesus, God!
I'm pulling, damnit!
Pull me in!
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Give me a break! What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Where is everybody? What happened?
I get it.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Old woman?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
You okay?!
I'm stuck!
Rizzo, pull away!
I know you.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
I think so, why?
Did you like it?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, you okay?
You'll be fine.
Okay, good tip.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Eat me.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Oh sure, all the time.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
You?
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Not so bad.
See? We're not so bad.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
I couldn't save them.
And what happend to ...?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Were you close to your father?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
I thought you meant...
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
That's why I'm here.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
What's this?
Hey!!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Rizzo?!
What if we don't?
What if you miss?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
We're screwed!
I guessed.
Med-kit?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
No you don't!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Outta here?
I hope so.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We have to get off this ship.
Where are you going?
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Oh I like her a lot.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
That's really funny.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
She needs a little time.
Well?
She broke my fucking nose!
Spunky . . .
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
It's time.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Now what?
Shut up, Thorgan!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Well, do something!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
I'll help you in.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Okay?!!
Again?! Jesus!
Kaboom.
I'm on my way.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
He's right behind us!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
We're screwed.
Yuck.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
NO!
Close the fucking door!
They'll make it.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
He was chasing me!
You lost the charge?
I...I don't know what I did...
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Push off toward us.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
You must shut down the engines.
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Now this is getting exciting.
GO, GO, GO!
Now that's just gross.
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
And what's with the headgear?
Thank you.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Just get us to the ship!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'm missing two!
You're leaving me here alone?
You're so bossy.
Would you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
So what else is new?
Hurry! She's lost it!
Let's just get out of here.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
That ought'a help the situation.
I'm gonna spew.
Small brains make your balls itch?
This is what it means right here.
Crutch?
What do we do?!!
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
What are you doing?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Jesus!
You prefer an apple?
Later.
You're quicker than usual.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
I don't know...sorry?
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
I'm just saying.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
No.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Maybe she tripped.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
You killed him?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
Are there any other shuttles?
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
You need to get laid!
I'm surrounded by idiots.
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Barbie from hell...
Kay-em 14.
Robot huh?
I love you.
I missed you too.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Kay-em you okay?
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
Kay-Em we made it!
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Oh, alright.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Do I have to?
Good point.
Who are you apologizing to?
Sorry, sorry.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Ow!
Almost done.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
It's just you and me, then.
Sory...
Am I in there?
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Oh shit! There he is!
I didn't say I was good at it.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
No! He's coming with us!
Leave him behind!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Kicker!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
We're missing two of the kids!
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
But?!!
I gotta go back.
What?!!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
Thirty seconds.
Then open the doors!
The power's back up!
Keep trying!
Something's wrong.
I just know.
How do you know?
Ssh.
What?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
I don't understand...what does he want?
See you then . . . doctor.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
I'm sending you the files.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Three...two...one...
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
You're crazy!
How do you open the damn door?
4You're not going anywhere.
Guys, please come with me!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
More soldiers?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
What good will that do?
Are we locked down?
You wanna die?
You're not going anywhere.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Get him out of there!
Azrael can you repeat that?
I didn't say he was alive.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Are you finished?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
That's right, now if you could...
But...I...400 years?
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
30? How long was I out?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Nanotechnology.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Obviously so.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
It's okay.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Sure but what good will that do?
Can we get through these?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Yes!
Exactly.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
What have I done?! Idiots.
What have you done?
Old Earth?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Hockey player? He's not a ...
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Here --  Take him home.
My cars. And a comic book.
Sure, Dad.
Just a favor for your old man.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I want him out of the ocean.
My boat's neat, dad!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
He's taken him!
He's comin' up -- !
Full throttle! To port!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's trying to sink us!
No!
Have you ever had one do this?
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
What about us?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Did you get him in the head?
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
That's it! Radio in for help!
The bilge pumps. There --
Where...?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
What's that one, there?
I almost had 'im.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
I never saw one that big.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
The wire's showing!
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
You got it?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Who's driving the boat?
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
You got it.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
It's my charter. My party.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
I know who he is...
This is Matt Hooper...
Try some of this. I made it myself.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
What?
Did you bring a check?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
What'll I tell the kids?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
You going to be all right?
Colorful, isn't he?
No. Home here.
Home... New York?
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
Can you do that?
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Thank you.
You too, sweetheart...
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
How come you have to tell them that?
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Michael! Come inside!
It's three feet deep, Martin
He's sitting in it.
Where is he?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Can you stand something to eat?
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Love ya.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Be careful.
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Older, sillier.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
I think they make you look sexy.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Don't forget these.
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Feed the dogs.
I never hear the whistle.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Probably out in the back yard.
Do you see the kids?
Right.
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Just sign it, Larry.
My kids were on that beach...
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
Maybe we can save August...
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Why?
Got a pen on you?
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
He lost it on the way up.
I'm going home.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
She's right.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Who's that young man?
Sure he is.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
I didn't agree to that!
Only 24 hours!
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Now tell me something I don't know.
Do I need any more authority?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I can't imagine why.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Just keep kicking.
Think the tide's with us?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
What day is this?
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Quint...?
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
It's a whale out there.
What the hell?
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
What's that, a ship?
This is quite a place.
This has got to be one big violation...
I wish it would rain...
I hope we get some more help.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
Wait a minute! I need you.
That means closing the beaches.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
No shark did that to a boat!
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
You all right?
Be careful, for chrissake.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Why don't we just tow it in?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
They must've hit something.
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
What happened?
We gotta get back soon...
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
Where'd you get all this?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
What is all this stuff?
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
Chum?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
What do we do?
...Nothing.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
He ate a car?
Florida license plate.
How can you tell?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What? What?!
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What's that?
Our friend, the shark.
What stinks so bad?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
You could say that.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
Rogue?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Let's all have a drink.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Swell.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
What d'ya mean?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
No, we just checked the beach...
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Who are you?
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Pretty stiff.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
You here for the summer?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You from around here?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Think she might've run out on you?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
I didn't know her.
You picked her up on the ferry.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Christine what?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
That wasn't funny.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
What's the matter with my printing?
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
What else could've done that?
We're not even sure what it was.
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Look at him take it!
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Twenty years.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Set?
One more after this, then I'm going home.
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Leg of lamb this time?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
You wanna call it a night after here?
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Yep.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Is that a boat?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
You're leaving?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
You love sharks?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Is anyone having this...?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
So would I. Come on in.
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Well... is everything all right?
He's busy.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
This is Quint, Missus.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
I've got all these signs here...
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
What have you got there, Lenny?
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
What can that gun of yours do?
He's under!
Follow him!
No way! He can't!
He's heading under -- !
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Coming right to us!
The shaft is giving.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
I think I can top that, Mister...
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
And I'll drink to yours.
I'll drink to your leg.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Ever see one like this?
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
What do you see?
Over there!
Fasten the pole.
I'm okay...
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Down here, Hooper!
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
What's that supposed to prove?
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Anti-Shark cage.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Let me see your hands...
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Transplants?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
I don't have it.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
You know how I feel about her.
Thanks for the message.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I don't think so.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Okay.
Can we make out now?
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Mine too.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Wizard!
It does?
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I try really hard, actually...
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
What, you mean as friends?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
You know it's okay.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Why?
Yeah. That was me.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Huh?
Wait, let me take that.
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
No...
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
I still have your virginity!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
What?
You're being really immature.
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
We're getting a stretch limo.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Um, hi?
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
I totally heard you did.
I don't like Katrina.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Were we together?
We could get back together too.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Well, I do.
Jesus, Bleek.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Oh. That's a relief.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Is that normal?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Really? What are they like?
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
I miss it too.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
What's up?
I'll try to drop by later.
Okay, cool.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Or something.
Charisma?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
But you copy my work every week.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Whose idea was it?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
So, what do you think we should do?
I know.
I'm supposed to be running.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I'm pregnant.
I don't know...
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Cool.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Hey Bleek.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I don't really know anything about it.
What a trip, man.
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Oh, hey Vijay.
Hey man.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
What are you talking about?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Excuse me?
What is your job title, exactly?
No... I guess not.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
What? I'm not made of stone.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Nails? Really?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Oh, go fly a kite.
Wow, dream big!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
We don't even have a dog!
I know enough.
You don't know anything about me!
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Cool it.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
No.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
Oh, God...
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Hon, did you get expelled?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
I'm a junior.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
God, you're so young.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
But you're old!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But I thought you'd be cool if...
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
What's the matter?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
No?
No.
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
What?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
I don't know.
What are you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Oh, okay. Like this.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
You do?
I actually know this one.
What?
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Come on, I have something for you.
Cool.
Nope. We're safe.
Is Vanessa here?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Go learn something.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Consider it your musical education.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Cute?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Hello?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Cold feet.
Why?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Why? What the big deal?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
You're something else.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Uh, thanks.
That suits you.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Here's to dovetailing interests.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
The Wizard of Gore?
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
You don't have to do that.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Hey, I like this.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
What is it?
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
We definitely want it to have junk.
Yeah?
I know what junk is.
You know... it's parts...
Junk?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
No, he's the dad.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
You're kidding!
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
I wrote that.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Oh.
Commercials.
Like what?
No, more commercial stuff.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Why aren't you at work?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Yeah.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
You weren't even alive!
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
When was this, like '96?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Yeah.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Oh.
I rock a Harmony.
What do you play?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Shut up.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Blood and guts.
Viscera?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
No.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Really? Fingernails?
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
I heard that was you.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
No thanks. I'm off pills.
You should try Adderall.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Nothing.
Juno? What's going on?
Wow! It's magical.
Elbow.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
No...
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Oh my God...
This is the baby. Your baby.
What...
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Is the baby okay?
I went to the doctor today.
Then what's going on?
Nothing...
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Oh really?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Sure.
Can I take your coats?
Vanessa, right?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Congrats.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Juno MacGuff.
Your name, please?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Thundercats are go!
Or...
Either I just pissed my pants or...
What?!
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I sort of already have.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Tore up from the floor up?
Please stop now.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Dad, no!
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Yeah, like people in love.
You mean like couples?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Yeah, she does.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Hi Dad.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Excuse me?
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
What?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Who is the kid?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
You're pregnant?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Eww, he's all beardy!
Keith's hot.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Well, you are kind of... convex.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Hot!
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Right, seriously.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
You sound shocked or something.
No way! She's pretty.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
What?
Hly shht!
Share the love, Tits!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Or stage parents!
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Aw, please Junebug?
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Touche.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
I'm pregnant.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
You're not listening to me.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
There are ads? For parents?
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
It was magnificent, man!
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
Aha! You love him.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
That is sick, man.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Unfortunately, yes.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Only the one in my pants.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Is this Juno?
I am a suicide risk.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
What do you make with that?
A Pilates machine?
So. What's that thing?
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
You don't say.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Aren't you the cool guy?
It's a loft.
A hotel?
Yeah, downtown.
Have you found a place to stay?
Looks like it, yeah.
We're actually, finally doing this?
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Don't mock me.
Like what? Be a rock star?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
What would be a good time for you?
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
She answered our prayers.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
What are you referring to?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What did you do?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Juno, what's the matter?
Can you see it?
Hm.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
And I disagree.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
They're yellow.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
You guys are playing music?
I want to be a mommy so badly!
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Adele for god sake please lis...
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
I suppose anything's possible.
You lose!
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
No.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
That's not true!
What?
...That's not true.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Jeez... Adele!
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
...Anything else?
Carryin' a gun.
What's Early been in jail for?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Yeah.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Adele... are you serious?
Do what?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Hold still.
No it is not!
That's me.
Took 'em all.
You took this picture?
Sure.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
It's a portfolio of my work.
What's this?
Could I try that?
I'm cool.
You can?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
How'd you meet Early?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
He whips you?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
So you don't do any of those things.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
You dropped this.
...Yeah, sure.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Not really.
Is it hard to learn?
...Yeah.
Are you takin' the pictures?
That French ain't it?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
What?
Karma.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
...Thank you.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Pardon?
Carrie.
Hi, I'm Adele.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Early! Stop!!
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
What's wrong with her?
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
...I don't know.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
...thank you.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Yeah but, what is it?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
What the hell is this stuff?
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Early, what're you doin'?
Early, sing me a song.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Shush, Adele.
As many times as it takes.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
What if they're dangerous?
I heard that.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
What'll we do out there?
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Almost.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Early, you are so sweet.
Happy birthday Adele.
No sir.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
What do you need a Bible for?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Turkey mostly.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Vernon, Florida.
Where you from Walter?
I don't know. Wish I did.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Walter Livesy.
What's your name, boy?
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
What happened to Adele?
You two been busy in here.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
...and?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
So tell me... what happened here?
Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
...Ha.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Damn right I do.
If you say so.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Nah... how much money have you got?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Yeah?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Sure.
You wanna hear mine?
Yeah.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Now why is that?
Dahlia, no.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
...Then some.
That bad?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Henry Lucas.
Who?
This guy killed a mess of people.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This the book your writing?
Forget it.
How much do I owe you?
Can't hurt.
...Too bad.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
So what do you do Early?
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Brian.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Best kind.
Tight fit.
I don't know.
What about you?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
What are you going to do?
Carrie, watch for Early.
Then try again, 
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Carrie... stop it.
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Why, what did he do?
Brian I want him out of our car!
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I'm finished.
There's more...
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
What's that?
Look again!
What is it?
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
How do you know that?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Who said he's my good buddy?
Take your time.
Fuck!
All set?
I don't want to talk about it.
Carrie.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
I heard that.
Up yours.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Lighten up...
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Funny, very funny.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
I still think we should have met them first.
I like that.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
What did he sound like on the phone?
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Why?
...and I think I know why.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
So how's it going?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
...just like that?
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
...I do.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
The party?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
A... I gotta go.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Thank god!
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Nervous?
Not yet.
Any word from that gallery?
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
...You know what I mean?
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
You were plenty hot.
...You're hurting me...
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Everybody just shut up!
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Shut your mouth.
Early, just think...
Siesta.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
No, never. Excuse me.
...never?
No.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...Brian hurt his foot.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
No, thanks, I can manage.
...Need a hand with those bags?
She wasn't feeling so good.
Where's Adele?
Bri'.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
...Janitor's job.
What is it?
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
Wasn't my fault...
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
...That'd be my guess.
...Diebold?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Without his car?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Where would we find him?
Could be.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
His Parole Officer.
Who are you?
What happened?
Now you gotta be careful.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
You're clean.
Yes!
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Were they wearing condoms?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
With how many people?
Yes.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes. Altogether.
Umm. Altogether?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
17.
How old you?
Hold up man.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Why not? You stink.
Nah.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
You are?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Yeah probably.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Fifteen for me.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
I don't know. How much do you want?
How much you gonna take?
Shut the fuck up.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Yeah.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Good luck?
So really, it's good luck.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Shut up.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Right.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
What are you talking about?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Why I give pennies?
That.
Why I do what?
I don't understand why you do that.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Bet.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I know what you mean.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
Yeah.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
Yeah.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Darcy?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Oh. You like her?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Who?
I wanna fuck Darcy.
He looks like my uncle.
Man, this guy is really good.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
I hate this game.
Yeah me too nigga.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Yep.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Can you do it man?
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
The cartoon?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Unzip my pack, yo.
You down with the boost?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You got any money?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You thirsty?
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
Yep.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
It's no big deal, right?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
It is right.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Why?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Did she suck your dick?
Yeah.
Telly.
Den less go Joe.
78th.
He lives on 76th?
Probably.
You think?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think he's got any herb?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
What for? That guys a dick.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
Are you hungry?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
What do you want?
Shit.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
What do you mean?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
To what? Virgins?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
Yeah.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Yeah.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Right.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
How?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
What?
You know what else?
Let me smell it again.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Oh man, that's the best.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Yeah.
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
How long did you fuck her?
Did what take?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
She can fuck?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Well, how was it?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
You fucked it?
What do you think?
Was up bitch?
Shit.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Casper, where is he?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where's Telly.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper.
Yeah. Do it again.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Yeah me too.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Man we fucked him up.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
You sure?
Na.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I had a female vagina last night.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yeah.
You goin'?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Where you goin' tonight?
Right here.
Where you at?
Nothen' B.
Casper! Was up kid?
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Sup. Sup.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Sup then? Sup?
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
What?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Of course I do.
Do you care about me?
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Nothing?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
But I'm scared Telly.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
How do you know?
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I'm nervous.
I like you too.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Come on.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Do you like kissing me?
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Yeah?
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Tonight?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Yeah. I can understand that.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
She won't? Why not?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
You were?
I was lookin' for you all day today.
Yeah.
At the block party?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
You have?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Is it cold?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Hold on.
Yeah. Come on.
Right now?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Hey.
Here. Swallow.
No...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No, Fidget, I...
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Bang up stuff.
What is it?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Who are they?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Of course I do.
Do you care about me?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
I wouldn't believe it?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Why is that?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Because your a virgin?
Because, you know why. You know.
Why?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
What do I want to do?
Yeah.
You know what I want to do?
I guess so.
Telly is at Steven's?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Come dance.
What?
Dance!
But I only had sex with Telly.
I'm sorry.
I tested positive?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
What?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
No.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Were you protected?
One.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
15.
How old are you?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Your a real philosopher.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yeah?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
Thanks.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Am I getting warm?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah, I guess so.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Everything is wrong.
Miss, would I be prying?
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Sorry.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah.
You're OK?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
What?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Hello.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I'm coming.
I gotta find him.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I only did it once and...
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Good luck.
Wish me luck.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
I hate sucking dick!
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Mine?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Passion...
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
No, I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
I didn't bleed.
Did you bleed?
I know.
You are being ripped open.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
You still mad at him?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Telly says was up.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Who, Benny's little sister?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Do you know where he went?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
What happened?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah?
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Whah is dissdee?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Whah?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Yep.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Yep.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Yeah.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Yeah I get bored.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yep.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Oh shit.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
It's like...
Yeah.
Sweet.
Making love is like.
Yep.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
What?!
No. I was just kidding.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Yep.
Oh god. That's horrible.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
No.
You've heard the stories right?
Yeah?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
I hate 'em.
He still does.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
You think so?
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
All right.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
When are you gonna be back?
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Shh.
Mom.
That's right.
But then I won't need your money.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Hi mom.
Yep.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Where does everyone sleep?
I don't know, eight or nine.
So, how many people live here now?
Nah.
You want a wip-it?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
What are you guys doing?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
Yeah.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
It was... it was.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
To come?
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yeah.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Right.
It's very monotonous.
Yeah.
It's grandmother style.
Slow.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
OK.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
I can't man.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
What man? What is it?
Sit down!
The message!  I figured out--
What?
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
Get off me!
Yes you are.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
You're a lying bastard!
I'm positive.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I was at the beach.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
Homesearchers.
Then let's narrow it down.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Then what's he talking about?
He's not talking about himself.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
No, I need the original note.
You got it on the board.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
No.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
What do you want?
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
No it wasn't.
The door was open.
How'd you get in here?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
I wouldn't know.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
Maybe you should.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
Are you crazy?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
What?
Morpheus.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
What do you mean, no?
No.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
What's that supposed to mean?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
You are!  I don't like you.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Casual.
What are you saying?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
What kind of problem?
We seem to have a little problem here?
Yes.
By yourself?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
What's the first street?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
What are you talking about?
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
You want me to what?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
Ready for round two?
It's a voice modulator.
What is it?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Sanderson?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
You alright?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
How is she?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
You still having a problem with this?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
Anything?
Sorry.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
No shit!
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
What was your relationship with her?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
You think he's dirty?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
What do you think?
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
Local?
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Run it down.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
We'll find the evidence.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
He was with me?
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
But a hundred men could move him.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
What was suspicious about him?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone stand out?
A few people.
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
Why does he call Sanderson?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
The pipes.
Very good.  How did you know?
I know where you are.
No!  Wait!!
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
It's me you want.  Not her.
The game's over.  You lost.
Please... wait.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Yes?
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
I've figured out the message.
By that time the game will be over.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
You sonofabitch!
Hello, Peter.
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
They think that you and I are doing this together.
The police haven't told you?
What word did you leave last night?
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Very good.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Hello.
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
What makes you think I was there?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
What?
You like to brag, don't you?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Have you any idea what the message is?
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
How?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Just for that no hint today.
Then call them!
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
I'm just trying to play the game.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
Just like who?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
But you said you didn't know her.
Because she's the type.
Why her?
Not really.
You know her?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Hello?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
You're not going to tell me that.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You'll find her.
Where is she?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
What?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Why not?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
And -- what path is that?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
Did you know her?
To get your attention.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Just a second.  Hello?
Hello, Peter.
I haven't got time for this.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Who is this?
Hello, Peter.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
You don't understand.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
What scars?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
What is it?
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
Now what?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Nope.  Nothing.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
No problem.  We're in.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Of course not.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
What's this?
Thanks.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
You're losing me.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
He was watching you.
Come here.
Why did he what?
Why did he?
He already did once.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
I just can't believe it.
Feeling better?
Fuck off!
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
You might not have done it had you known.
Nice meeting you.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I know he really likes you.
Of course.
Do you like my dad?
Boys.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Is your dad here?
I'm Kathy.
Uh huh.
You must be Erica.
Who's Kathy?
It isn't Kathy.
But you promised.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
For what?
You ready?
Thanks, David.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Nothing.
What is it, dad?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Has he gotten through to any?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Who told you that?
Okay.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
That has nothing to do with it.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
What are you doing up?
My cheering section.
Congratulations, dad.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
How long she been dead?
Yeah.
Same as the others?
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
That's great.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
No Frank.  No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
No prints.
What about prints?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
Anything?
Bingo.
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Any sign of rape?
Six, eight hours tops.
How long has she been dead?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Did you see his face?
You don't have a shred of evidence!
The most logical choice.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
We're going to work on the message.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
What does that mean?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
He's right, Kathy.
About a quarter to one.
What time did he get there?
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
As large as castles.
That's a big area to cover.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
What did he mean by Huxley?
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
This ain't no photo.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Meaning?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Anything else?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
What about the way he arranged the body?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Kathy?
It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
But we heard him.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
And this Jeremy--
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
It's important.
I'm busy right now.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
What do you think he did?
We're not sure.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Well?
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Through a rental agency.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Ten days ago.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
Did you send the car?
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
I went out.
Answer the question.
Are we going to go through this again?
Where were you last night?
That's got to be it.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
A building?
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
Maybe I already have.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
It doesn't make sense.
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
That's it?
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
I got it from the tournament directory.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Feel like practicing?
No.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Exactly... and you did this.
Mate in five.
What do you see here?
Who says something's on my mind.
Whatever's on your mind.
About what?
Just thought you might want to talk.
You have something you want to say?
I want to be the best I can.
You're always in the middle of a match.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Peter...
Is it serious?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
We got a problem?
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
It's a good play, but risky.
I suppose you have something in mind?
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Then I'll transpose.
He knows you're aware of that.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
What are they, please?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Bainbridge Books.
We'll call you back.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
I can check and call you back.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Bainbridge Books.
Do we have a future?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
It's over now.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
I got lucky.
You beat him.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
Are you going to come tonight?
You're going to be late for your match.
Of course not.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
He didn't tell you either.
You're right.  The killer told me.
No he didn't.
Frank told me.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
It's got to be grammatically correct.
It could be anything.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Because I know what it says.
Why not?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Because she killed herself!!
Why?
But I do.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
It's not that easy.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
You don't understand.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
Peter...
You really haven't seen my best side.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Can I come in?
Hi.
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Where's the note?
What?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Exactly.  It's the key.
For emphasis?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
Peter...
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Peter, you have to admit--
Then why are you backing up?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
I tried again and got through.
I thought you said the line was busy?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Did you call?
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
You.
What do you want on it?
Fine.
Call room service.
I'm hungry.
No.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You've got to face the things you feel.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
Then show me who you are.
I just don't want to fight with you.
Does anyone?
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
What?  By attacking me?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What is this?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I'm not playing a game now.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
What?
And you?
It was.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I'm sorry.
She died in a car accident.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
Alright.  What about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
I'm sure you are.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Because I think he's wrong.
Why?
No.
Doesn't that scare you?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
I know you didn't
How could you?  Unless you were there.
I know it was bad.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Relax.
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
You're not?
No.
Because I work with them.
Why?
Of course.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
You have to win every point, don't you?
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
That's not fair!
You mean like in the steam room?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
I'm just curious.
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
Let's change the subject.
Do you?
Of course.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
This isn't a game.
In a way.
Another kind of game?
I think it's interesting.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
It wasn't intentional.
You sound like my mother.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
I don't think I could.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
She could be dead now.
She could be dead after the game.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
We need your help.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
They couldn't break the riddle.
No you didn't.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
What are you looking for?
Getting too hot in here for you?
Well, I think I've had enough.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
You.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Do you always open quickly?
It is.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
That's a very personal question.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Sounds very violent.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
It seems like such a complicated game.
When I was very young.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Yes.
Are you one of the players?
Uh huh.
Are you with the tournament?
No.  I don't.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
How come you don't stay with them?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Yes.
Is this your first time here?
It's alright.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I'm not nervous.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm sure you are.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Yes.
That's a better one.
That way. I can feel the cold.
In the Arctic ice.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
Lyssa ...
I knew you would come.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Yes.
All directions are the same here.
Take the western passage.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
I don't know how.
Will your power outward.
All the passages are guarded.
You must move away from the Center.
Colwyn ...
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
I know it.
I will find you. I will be with you.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Where is the Fortress?
Colwyn ...
Lyssa ...
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Have they harmed you?
Colwyn.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I can't wait either.
About what?
I lied.
I can't.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
We're almost married.
<u>What</u>?
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Well, you're beautiful.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
That's worse.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Me too.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
I don't have to go through with it either.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I won't leave you here.
You will go alone.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
They have Lyssa!
Of course it was.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
I forbid you!
I can. Because I choose it.
No! You cannot know that!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
You're coming with us.
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Use your sword.
She can see the Beast!
I chose the wrong passage.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
Where the spiral begins.
The spiral begins in the west.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
She must make a glaive.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
The Beast will kill her.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
Let us wish him peace.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
From here, I must go alone.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
Yes.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Never.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Can she be forced?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
He has come for Lyssa.
Yes.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
You will know, in good time.
But you suspect.
I'm not sure.
<u>Why</u>?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
I cannot reach her.
I will find her!
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
What do you see?
I can't reach her.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
They know when they're going to die?
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
You choose these?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
You have not slept in two days.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
The Fortress moves?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Reach out farther. Call to her.
There is nothing.
You won't have to.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You have rope?
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
But there is another entrance to this place.
There is no other way.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
I have no extraordinary powers.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Turold's son was to marry her.
The new Queen lives.
Does the Queen live?
The White Castle has fallen.
Each to his fate.
Each to his fate.
Yes. It is today.
It is today?
Saddles.
I road them often in my youth.
You have done it?
They can be saddled.
What will happen?
Do not let the waters touch you.
We must enter the swamp.
Slayers!
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
How did you know?
I cannot.
You will not, then?
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I cannot betray my bride.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Let me comfort you.
I ache with it.
You too are lonely.
Yes.
Even by you?
Yes.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.
Am I not worth returning to?
I don't think that.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
What else is left for a man without friends.
You and I will guard the fire.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
I have need of friends.
My <u>friend</u>.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
He saved our lives.
Once is enough, thank you.
Staying alive.
What business?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Naturally.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
At the gallop!
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Yes, my lord.
Go. I command you.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go, join them.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
A flicker of talent.
Hand over your dinner.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
These we'll pay for.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We must try to get horses.
You've eaten nothing.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Well, I'm not impressed.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
No.
Not sleepy, either?
I'm not hungry.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
I'm all right.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
That I promise you.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
To the place where Death lives.
And where do you lead, boy?
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
You will follow me.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
I know you.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
How did you know I had sons?
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Fame.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
I don't think you'll grow careless.
And mine goes with you.
My heart stays here.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
Quell?
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
A small house.
A venison pie as big as a house.
No.
Can't I come, too?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Where are you going?
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
What is that awful looking place?
I am Quell.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
You!
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
Would you settle for a boar?
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Would you desert your friends?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
We meant only to please you.
It's right behind you.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
I don't think it's working.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
I only want one.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I'd wish for a puppy.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I'm hungry.
I ...  ... am Titch.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
You can have half.
You do?
I have a cinnamon bar.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
Look at its insides.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Hush!
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Oh, my poor stew!
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Food for crows.
We have plenty of hares.
And do you think I live on air?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
You had better manners as a pig.
Put me down, you lout!
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
No. He will master the leader.
They'll trample him to death!
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
He is the King.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He didn't join them. They joined him.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
He will come for me.
Then he will die!
He will not!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
It's a lie!
Then look!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
A fine match.
A match for your son, I think.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
That I am, my lady.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
I knew.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Yes.
It is important to assure the succession.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Freylag's stronghold?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
What news from our friends?
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Modred! Impossible!
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
How many did you lose?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
Yes. We lost five.
You were attacked in the forest?
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
Can you see?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
It is the time.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
You know the voice.
With an old voice?
The new King.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
That is true.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
It is too late. He has drunk.
Kegan!
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Look.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
Each to his fate, lad.
Fewer will survive them.
Few have survived it.
She had another name once.
Her name is Death.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
She has the power to kill.
She has the power of vision.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Yes.
The Widow of the Web?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
Many have perished in that maze.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
You will come with me.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
I cannot stop the sand.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
It will not help.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
No.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
You lie!
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Why must you know?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Of what?
Knowledge.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Yes.
You see?
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
It is no trickery.
Do not try your trickery on me!
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
Where is he? My son.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had a son.
We had no children.
She bore you many children?
No, she was not as beautiful.
She was not as beautiful.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
But you would not stay with me.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
I was beautiful then.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
Ynyr!
Who speaks that name!
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Yeah... How do you know it?
...Office 2702.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Why do you want to know?
What's that man's name?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...What?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
No.
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
No?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Well, I don't need them...
Take...
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Why can't I have a bank account?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
No, no.
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
Do you need money?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Yes.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
...Not at all.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Yeah.
...You moved too, didn't you?
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
You say it just to calm me!
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
Mathilda, listen!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
I don't know... Five minutes.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
Yeah, what?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Nothing, for the moment.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
...Yes.
May I ask you a personal question?
Three times, then two times.
Yes.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...I don't know.
How many girlfriends did you have?
...Don't you like me?
...No...
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Don't you drink?
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Poor darling, and then?
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
I love you so much, Leon.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Risky business, isn't it?
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
It's too big.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
A little...
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...Later.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...Why didn't he close the window?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Where are you going?
I think.
What shall we do?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...17.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Mathilda?!
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
When I say I love you.
What?
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Mathilda, stop, please!
...I'm going to kiss you.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
I never rent my gear.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Too heavy.
Why?
Not taken.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
No, you can't go out.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
No.
May I go to the cinema?
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Yes.
Mathilda? May I come in?
...Because I feel it.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
You were scared, weren't you?
Come on, get down!
OK.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
What?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Yes, yes...
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
OK.
The yellow and pink.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
Good! First shot!
Perfect.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Whoever.
Who'll I aim at?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Rocket launcher.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
What, for example?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
How can you say it?
130... 140...
Huh... 500 meters?
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Good.
OK, I'm fine.
I have no fear.
Don't fear.
...One second.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
...Yes?
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Yes?
...No... he's my lover...
Huh?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh, that's good!
...Composer.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Fine...
How are you, Miss?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
...OK... Good.
Ten dollars... A month.
...And how much is it?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Huh? Why?
You can't sit here like that.
Salute.
Salute.
...Yeah.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
No...
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Yes... Twice.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
No... Dino's.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Is he still alive?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
...Who sent you?
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
But... He works for your same employer?
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
Messina.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
These guys have no place.  They change virtually everyday. And his name...  It's a surname.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Do you recognize him?
Then...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Here comes the resume.
Why am I such an authority?
This smells good.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
What is it?
For a walk.  I don't know.
Where?
He probably just went somewhere.
I won't let you die.
I have to finish first.
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
What?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
How serious is it?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
Maybe later.
Are you two planning kids?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Nothing's going to happen.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
No it's not.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I'll make it.
What if you don't make it?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
It's impossible.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I don't accept that.
I have new dreams now.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
Thank you.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
How long does this... Mania last?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
What would you like us to do?
I'll kill you!
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
That's enough.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
You need a ride, Preacher?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
Are you a preacher?
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Mine.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
What steps do we take now?
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
Can it kill me?
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Twenty miles?  I see.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Okay.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
You have?
I've seen it before.
You do?
I know what you're getting at.
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
Yes -- you are.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Pardon?
So what's the deal Maurice?
Good.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Go to sleep Ellen.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Yes.
Maurice?
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Why there?
Pacifica, California.
Where?
I know where my heaven is.
Did you have a dream?
I think it's a different place for each person.
I don't know.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
That's okay -- really it is.
He's plastered.
Your father?
It'll make it.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Don't be so sure.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
You can change.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Yes.
You've just decided, is that right?
I want children.
You can't change your mind.
I've changed my mind.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
Please tell me.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
You like to take walks?
Walk with me?
I will -- I promise.
Show me.
I do love you... very, very much.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
There's no reason.
Then why?
No.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Why do you polish it?
You're talking to me?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Anything?
Yes.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
You don't think I love you?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I don't follow.
What it is -- is the truth.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
We can do it together.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
The new store?
What?
Ellen?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
It's a special day isn't it?
It's just a regular day.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
There was no card.
You thought I sent them?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Yes?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
About my love for her.
Doubts?  About what?
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
That's a reasonable assumption.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Most certainly.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Why?
I see.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
From where?
Pacifica, California.
To where?
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
What did they ask?
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
Jumped where?
Shit!  He jumped!
That's all right isn't it?
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
This guy's not a murderer.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
Red flags man.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Red flag, man.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
What's his story?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Nine.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
That's me.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Who's telling this story?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
You tell stories?
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
I thought you were asleep.
Yeah!
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Is that right?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Well, hello.
By car right?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Perhaps there's another route?
What was that?
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
Making the grand total?
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Maybe.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
The Gazette's small huh?
Mammoth.
This story is big huh?
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
It's mine to risk.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Don't do this.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
I do.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
What, come on?
Come on Mr. Parker.
Saluting.
Are they standing?
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
I missed you Kris.
You're amazing.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
Tom Joad?
She never ate a slice.
What Mr. Parker?
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
So I've been informed.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
Why know?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
She knew you loved her.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
You're walking to California?
I told you.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
Phileas Fogg?
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
California.
Walking where?
I'm walking there Kris.
Tomorrow.
When are you leaving?
California.
Where?
Yes.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
Are you firing me?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
What happened?
Pulitzer, here I come.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
It has to be a full character's name.
You're amazing.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
Someone should be with you.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
... My father.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
I need your help.
You're in pain.
Do you have a car, Steph?
Steph.
What do your friends call you?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
In a hospital.
Where am I?
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Yes.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Where did he go?
Forty-seven years.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
I don't have kids.
Oh, that's not mine.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Good morning.
Good morning.
What?  Who are you?
What's your shoe size?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
What do you mean?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
How are you feeling?
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
This isn't right.
I really want that watch.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
It's yours.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
Evening News?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Water.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Water?
Water?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Orange soda?
...Noooo.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
What do you think I should get?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
No alcohol?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
What are my choices?
What do you want?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Yes.
You know I love you... yeah?
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
I wanted to see you...
Yes... I guess I knew that.
There are limits.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Will you lighten up, please?
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
OK.
Let's stay for a while.
I like it here with you.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
They wouldn't know.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
No... we already talked about that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Thank you, Sera.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Please!
Can we just ignore it?
I don't understand any of that.
Can we just forget it?
What was that all about?
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Your color.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Be careful.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
We?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Oh, and what did you do?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
How are you doing?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
What do you mean?
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
When?
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
I'm going to fill it right now.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
I know that...
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
No?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Well... OK...
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Why?
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
OK.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Sorry.
Ben?
Of course.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Right... OK...
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Hi!
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
What?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Don't be silly?
Don't you like me, Ben?
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Sera you are crazy.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Me neither.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Sera...
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
What do you mean?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
How long have I been here?
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Very clever.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Yes.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Do they have drinks?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Thank you. What time is it?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
You OK?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
You OK out there?
This is the home of an angel.
You do?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
Yes.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Are you serious.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
What's up?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Don't run away.
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
If I was I'm sorry.
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Yes, that's right.
To death?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
OK... whatever.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Do you want to fuck now?
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Of course.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
You were going to get my door.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
I sometimes fade out.
You what?
I guess I do too.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
No -- S.E.R.A.
Sarah -- with an H?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
You're pretty drunk.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Are you working?
Hello.
Hello!
I don't know. I'll find out though.
How much, do you think?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
How'd this happen?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
What did they look like?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Where are you staying?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
About ready for another drink?
Sera... please go.
Yuri... are you...
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
No.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
It's me, Yuri.
Yes? What?
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
Don't hit me.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
A full night on the street and this is all?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Where have you been?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
With an old friend.
Where have you been staying?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
I am lonely, Yuri.
You have been lonely?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
I've been all right.
You have been lonely?
Please, Yuri.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I have a 4.0.
But it's a top three school --
That's right.
Harvard Law School?
Who?
You're fired. I have new representation.
What?
Get up.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
I believe we are.
Are we done for today?
I'll take that as a no.
Go to hell.
Were you with another man?
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
I loved him!
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Why would I kill my husband?
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I can't tell you.
What alibi?
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
That's not what's important.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
Is he always such an ass?
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
What's going on?
I believe you! Don't worry.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
No!
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
How?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
It's so shameful...
Who could better understand than me?
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Sort of.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
No.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Because they got wet.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
How many, would you say?
Yes.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Yes.
Where you got in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Yes. I was washing my hair.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
I guess.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
No. I was in the shower.
Did you hear a shot fired?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Tell him, Paulette.
Huh?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Come again?
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Who's askin'?
Dewey Newcomb?
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Yes, I am.
You're not going up there.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
So everything you just said --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
You're hitting on me?
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
I'm sorry, but --
About the alibi --
Thank you.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Is everything okay?
Sit down.
Thank you!
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
What are you talking about?
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Why the hell not?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Did you get it?
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Just the love in my heart.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Was she carrying a weapon?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
What did you see when you entered the house?
See?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Uh -- both?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
I'm sorry?
-- uh --
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
What?
Why didn't you call me?
He chose them already?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What's going on?
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
I don't know.
-- his life?
How about --
I think so...
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Yes?
Aristotle.
Yes?
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
You can't go home!
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
How'd it go at the trial?
I'm so happy for you!
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Good one.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
What's the point?  Look at me.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
God, that felt great!
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
No.
You ready?
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Definitely! I love him!
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Is she?
Is she as pretty as you?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
That's terrible!
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
No!
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
What'd you do?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
After you went to all that trouble?
Spill.
You can't even imagine.
Delta. Gamma.
Name?
I'm her sister.
Relation?
Uh -- family.
Licensed attorney or family member?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Yes, he is.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Yes, you are.
I'm a bitch.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
What?
You almost had me fooled.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
Really?
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You're kidding!
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
I know. He has it sent out.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Really? Thanks.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
It's not my alibi to tell --
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
The idiot speaks.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Our group is full.
You know her?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Not yet.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Margot!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
I will...
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
No way --
Josh proposed!
What?!
Picking out my wedding dress!
Power yoga?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Your scrunchie?
Here. You're gonna need this.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
So?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Thank you. I love you, too.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Too demure?
You think?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
You guys are so sweet!
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
What do you think?
Is he the only one?
Someone missed you.
So Friday at eight?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Are you asking me on a date?
Up for a celebration dinner?
Oh, my God!!
Oh, my God!
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
So now you're -- ?
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Whoa -- Why?
I'm quitting.
Hey --
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
What?!
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
For a butt-head? Yes.
You really think I'm attractive?
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
What the hell is that for?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
I can't.
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Okay, how would it work?
You're serious?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
The what?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
So?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
And you know this for a fact?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
She's not!
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
No, she can't move for an hour.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Maybe not to your face...
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
How do you figure?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
But maybe it is --
But maybe it's not what you think.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Why?
She's completely untrustworthy.
Aside from that.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
I wasn't gonna --
Don't ask.
Thanks again for your help!
Good luck.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Neat.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Did she do that to you, too?
You have Stromwell.
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Where's Warner?
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
What're you doing here?!
Really --
I got bangs!
What?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Almost.
Absolutely!
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
What, like on va-kay?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Are you sure?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
How could this happen?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
What happened?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Of course, I do!
You don't really believe she's innocent?
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
Maybe she found him like that.
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Amazing how?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
It's pink.
I do.
You should. Do you have a resume?
I don't know --
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I did?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
Why not?
Neither.
I guess it'll have to...
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
Your what?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Are you serious?
In court. On opposing sides.
Really?
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Thanks for the backup.
See?
Pink ones.
I gave her my word, Warner.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Thank you.
You look -- nice.
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Well, yeah, but --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
I didn't mean --
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Now I am.
Thank you. Having fun?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Do anything exciting?
Good. Good.
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Uh -- sure.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
What, like it's that hard?
You got into Harvard Law?
Harvard. Law school.
You go where?
No, silly. I go here.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
East coast people are different.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
No.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
That's not entirely --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
That's why I think it's time for us to --
I completely agree.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
And I fully support that.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
Of course.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
So are you!
You're beautiful.
Chuck.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Three months.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Where?
Yes.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Hovering?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Why do you say that?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
She's naked.
Pull up next to him!
There he is!
Yeah, luckily.
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Why?!
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Let's all go! Road trip!
Cunnilingus?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You're right. Phew!
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
It's not a Theta --
Is it a Kappa?
Where's the Rock?
Elle?
Purely a precaution...
Fire moat... why do that?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
We come watch... we come watch...
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
You go?  Not watch fun?
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Then we smash 'em?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Fool's magic.
Faith.
Why so few?
To finish last evening's delightful work.
You go to lady now?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
More fun win battle?
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
We watch... good fun...
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Birdies... pretty...
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
We go out, smash 'em now?
Always.
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
What?
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Or looked so beautiful...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
And, now?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Might we watch, too?
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
You're a beast!
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
I don't expect you'd understand.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
I see...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
What will become of me then?
Yes?
And then?
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Oh, yes...
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
What do you want from me?
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
No more... please...
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
Do it now!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Damn you!
I'd soon die.
To be my bride, of course.
Why have you brought me here?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Like some vile toadstool.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Protection?
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
I am afraid of nothing.
And you... are you not also afraid?
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
You... you're a beast!
Not from me, surely...
God protect me.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You're magnificent.
But I'm hideous!
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Your love.
What do you want with me?
My generosity is not so large as that.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
No, wait... please... listen...
Oh no... Don't you understand?
You come stealee tleasoo?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
It's terrible.
Flozen foleva not good.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
East of Mercia?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Cathay?
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You come stealee tleasoo?
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
I didn't know... I --
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
Who might these friends be?
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
I'll try.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
That's it then... the ring!
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
And did you?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Go on... go on...
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Where?
I was with the Princess.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I've not heard a note out of you.
A good day for singing...
You're on your own... like a true champion.
He'll not escape me.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Sapphire!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
I could have struck off his head just now!
Never show mercy!
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Hurry up!
Don't get too far!
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Can't we move any faster?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Patience, lad.
Will you explain what's going on?
Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Sunlight.
What weapon?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Did you bring me here to sup?
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Sunlight, you say?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
I don't... understand.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Can you save her?
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
The wound is mortal.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
It doesn't matter.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Fire away!
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
That's it!
One more turn...
There must be some way to get it up there.
Will you chance a miss?
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
What magic have we on our side?
Been telling you that all along, lad.
There isn't much time!
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Water doesn't burn...
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
There aren't enough arrows.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Easily spoken...
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Why not mine the damned walls?
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
The chill is worse this night.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
No... but what choice have we?
Can we trust him?
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Nay.  This time we strike first!
Wait, Jack.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll find it.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Is she... dead?
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Willful creature, that one...
Wait!
It bodes evil.
What make ye of that, Jack?
There's the way, mates.
God's blessing.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
I should hope not!
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Certainly understandable.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Ogg's footprints!
Something the matter?
My God!  Look!
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Nice piece of work.
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Good.
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Stealing his arms?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
What know you of fields of war?
Worse than the battlefield.
Jack, don't!
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Blackheart?
This is ogre's magic.
Good plan that.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Beware.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Whatever for?
We must follow that bird.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Track the demon to his lair.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Fine-looking army.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Aye!  That too.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
The colt's still too small.
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
Careful, lad.
Damn them!
It would appear so.
Pregnant, is she?
Something's coming.
What is it?
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Shhhh!
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
By the grace of God.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Knaves and robbers...
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
And who might that be?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
The princess is dead.
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
What do I do?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Are we here?
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
Will you lead me to her?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
There must be an answer somewhere.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Don't you care about what's happened?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Don't you know?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
But... but, why?
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
What does she want from me?
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
I fear she's lost.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You be our guest, Jack.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
What!
It's bluebells!
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
And if I cannot?
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
I meant no disrespect.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
No... I... I need to rest.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
Enough!
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
To be sure.
Faerie ring?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Gump, is it?
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Sorry.
Dolt!
They'll do nicely.
How're these?
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Aye... my Lord...
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
They've fired the moat!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Three cheers for our champion.
Well done, lad.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
We seek to undo the curse.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You see!  You see!
No, no, no... this is different!
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
I can't see a thing.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Pinching?  Where?
Pinching me!
Biting you?
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
What's the matter?
And I love you, my husband.
Lili... I love you!
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
You're teasing still.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
And I... love you...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
In the dark... where I join him...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Sunlight?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
What?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
You've freed me, Jack...
No!  I won't let it happen...
They told me you were dead.
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
I thought you were dead... I --
Only what's right...
What have I done?
Jack... Forgive me...
Lili!  No!
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Then, perchance you'll me.
I have no wife.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
I'm afraid it may storm.
Oh, la...
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
My lady mocks me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
There's no happier thought under heaven.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Tis the truth.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Its powers are strong.
I don't want it on me.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
He did run?
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
My own father...
They tricked you.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
My father and the Baron.
Who?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
What happened?
To fetch your napkin.
Where are you going?
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Jack!
Are you honest?
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Shhh!
How much longer?
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I'm not its master.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I'll go search for it.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
What's the matter?
Oh, dear.
Be patient.
What shall we do?
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
I detest serpents.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
A gentleman would offer water.
Stop complaining.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Unicorn?
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Sport, indeed.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Or perchance...
Liar!
I may have said perhaps...
But you did... you did!
Never.
You promised!
If you like.
These for me?
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Sigurd's sword...
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Step lively now!
Thought the weather terrible of late.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
You'll visit again?
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
This is sad news, be it true.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
I don't believe you.
Dead, dead, dead.
No!
She's dead!
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
As fair as me?
Exceeding fair.
Is she fair, this princess?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
What became of the princess?
Ask away, sweet man.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Not very precise directions.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
How do I get the horn back?
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
What's this now?
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Heading north still?
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
Be fair, Oona.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
And as barren of love as stone.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Please...
You... you... you mortal you!
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
I'm promised to another!
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
And sweet?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
How so?
Jest with me then.
That was in jest.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Wondrously so.
And am I not fair?
In every way.
Do I not please you, Jack?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And charmed, of course.
Only that?
I'd be honored.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
No fear of that now.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Sorry.
This is not the time for squabbling.
I pray God grants it me.
Courage, Jack.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Sorry, Jack.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
Hello, Jack.
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
What care the bones when the soul is free?
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Up ahead!
Where?
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Praise be to God.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
I think she's about to foal.
What's she doing?
We wait.
What do we do now?
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
The fastest in the world.
May God protect you.
You're with us in battle.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Uhm... fine work.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
How came you by this blade?
Oh, but I have.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
In a dream.
You've been inside?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
A castle's but stone and mortar --
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
You follow.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
That very nice.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
To Castle Couer de Noir?
Can you show us the way?
You do know where it is?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Simple as that, eh?
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Lost?
The Black Baron, you say?
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Is he a friend, then?
I'm sending you back to Hell!
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
He was there and then he wasn't!
Dad's disappeared!
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
What are you doing?
Marco!
It's so beautiful.
When does George get to come see his house?
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
He's not there.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
And video games after!
Since seventh grade.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
Sam!
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
We can work.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
I wanna be with you today.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
I thought I might stop by.
Are you going to see Sam again?
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Red.
What color?
Do you guys feel like painting?
Who are you?
He hasn't called?
I don't think Dad wants you home.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
I would have anyway.
Oh.
Mom said I should.
What's that for?
Who are all these people?
Atonement.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'm going to bed.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Why?  What do you mean?
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
I couldn't sleep last night.
What are you doing up so early?
Oh God, we don't want the police!
You'd better call and cancel.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
And why was the alarm on?
I couldn't get it to go down.
What's wrong?
I put him to work.
Here, honey!
Mom?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
What did you think it would be?
It's not what I was expecting.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
My mother would die.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Did you feel anything?
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
You have to ask like that?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
You're a good girl.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
Can you keep Sam straight?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I had them in my pocket.
What's that?
My keys.
Monday.
What's today?
Nope.
Don't you have school?
Is that legal?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Alyssa.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Why?
No.
Are you his friend?
He seems lonely.
He must.
I'll survive.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
What?
Floating to Catalina.
Where are you?!
I don't wanna go.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
I don't wanna go.
Not if what he left me was real.
You'd hate him for the trick.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You hate your father.
What?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
Are you afraid of heights?
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
Okay.  I guess.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
I thought I was helping you.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Not really.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
I was wondering.
I'm not gay.
Josh said...
What are you talking about?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
Does everything have to have a point?
What's the point of this?
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Why are you so uptight?
Why are you so stupid?
We're not gonna do anything.
I don't want you to!
I'm coming in.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
Really?
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
I'm okay.
I can use your mom's.
Huh?
No thanks.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Turn over.
Why?
I wanted him to marry her.
Really?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Yeah.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
No.  That's okay.
I'll get your back.
I might not stay, anyway.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I can't even take a shower here.
You look better without make-up.
He's a freak.
Tell him I said "hi".
He jumped into the ocean.
Where's your dad?
I don't know.
You should stay.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
I don't know.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Where to?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
What are you doing here?
Hey.
Hi.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
No.
Will he talk to me?
He won't leave my room.
He's not the type to worry.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He's at work while I'm here.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Why is that?
He's got a standing invitation.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
We've known each other since grade school.
Are you guys' friends?
You've been good this week.
It could have been a squirt gun.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
This is such a street of whiners.
Months.
That would take weeks.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
I have the permit.
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
It's thirty feet.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
If that's what it takes.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I flushed it down the toilet.
I hate to ask about a window.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
A sink?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
And if I enclosed it?
Oh, yes.
A violation?
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
I've been dreading you.
Mr. Stevens?
Yes, it is.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Thank you.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
What can I do for you, George?
I've got one favor to ask.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
Well, I feel better about this now.
For everything.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
I hate this job.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
Forty.
How old are you?
Oh.
That's too long.
Maybe...?
Maybe that's too long.
I've been here twenty years.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
I'm not.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
He buys and sells the world.
Right...she married...what was he?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
How's your wife?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
how much weight have you lost?
Pardon me?
What are you on?
I'm good, thanks.
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
Is Alyssa here?
We're getting out of the ground today.
You're here early today.
Thank you.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks for the shower.
Not a shower.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you!
Uh huh.
Sam?
Oh...okay.
She didn't really say.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She's out with a friend.
Is Alyssa home?
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
Hello?
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I forgot where I put my keys.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I did warn you.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
George, this is the third time.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
He escaped.  He's going back in.
This has got to stop!
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
I'll ask.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I don't know.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Here.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
You lied to me!
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
Yes.
And you told Mom today?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
Are you taking them still?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
What's wrong with your back?
She seemed upset.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
You look better than ever.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
That's so weird...
After everything.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I loved him too much.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I would have killed him.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Why wouldn't she leave?
To hide a black eye.
Sun glasses?
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Are you talking?
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Getting high, I guess.
What would you be doing now?
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I gave up on you.
I'm telling you now.
I wish you had told me then.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
He's got nothing to do with me.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
What do you know about me?
I know parts of who you are.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
That's not true.
Nothing.
What are you now?
What I'm not.
What would you like to be?
How do you become something you're not?
I know the feeling.
I like how it feels not to feel.
I know.  Why?
I took some of your Vicodin.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Alyssa.
Try it.  It feels good.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Don't.  I don't want it.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
I'm not even listening.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I'll have to pay him back.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
No.
Sit down for a second.
You can't make me do a thing.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You're too fucking late.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I might have a solution.
Did you got through my pants?
A friend of yours is here.
Where is it?
Oh, okay.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Where are you going?
Hey...hey!
I'm leaving.
You'll have money when you work for it.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
I can promise you complete privacy.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't beg.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
It'll be fine.
I'm not doing it!
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
No one would blame me if I left!
You're so predictable.
You'll have money when you work.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I don't know.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
It bugs me.
Why?
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
No you don't.
I hate turkey.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
No.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
I warned you yesterday.
What are you doing?!
Goodnight.
Probably in the bible.
I almost saw Catalina.
Are you totally insane?!
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
I'll hate you forever.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Mom...please.
You don't have a choice.
I'm not going!
You have everything?
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I'll get your bag.
I'm not going!
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
No I'm not!
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
Because I live there.
Why would you be there?
I'll be around to check up on you.
To check up on me?
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
I haven't been touched in years.
Good for you.
I can die trying.
Can you build a house in four months?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
You know what mortise and tenon is?
What kind of house?
I'd build a house.
What would you do?
Good for you.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
I want you to find someone for me.
God, you look like crap, George.
I need you to do me a favor.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I know there's an explanation.
Ah!  Oh....
At least your father tried, George.
Thanks for telling me.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Left you this place.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
I aimed high.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
She's a little sad, is all.
Because Dad left?
She needs to be alone, I think.
It's okay.
Oh.  Sorry.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Three.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
Not a perfect day.
I better get the kids home.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Don't move!
It's not my back that's killing me.
Are you going to kiss me?
So could I.
I could die.
What?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
What did he say?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Left you?
Peter left me yesterday.
No.  Mostly me.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Is your back still killing you?
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
I need to know.
Let's not do this, okay?
If I weren't married?
You bit my finger.
I'm married.
I can't pick you up.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You've never said that before.
That was the truth.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
What did I say?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Going on?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I can hire workers to help me.
I thought we were helping.
I'd rather you not be here.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
I smiled at him.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
This was my very first slow dance.
It's been a while.
I think so.
Do you need help?
You're a good mother.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
You brought your kids?
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Where's Sam?
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
My stupid back.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
You're not well.
With your hands or your tongue?
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
Oh...with his ear infection!
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Finished or unfinished?
I dreamed about your house last night.
It's not breakfast yet.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
What is it?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
Do you remember?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
What have you been before today?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Sam's favorite.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
The first and the last.
Which?
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I used to live here.
What?
It makes me sad.
Well, for later then.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
George --
Let's go.
I did say he could go.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
Last time you were gone for a week!
I can't leave the house?
I drove over and you were gone.
I don't have a phone.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I'm married.
Hey, hey!
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I want him with me.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
One of you would end up dead.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
When's school over?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
The garage.
Where will you live?
I love those doors.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Money?
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Why call me?
I was parked in day parking.
Why would they tow your truck?
I need to talk to you.
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
But you can't call me while you think?
Kurt's been feeding him.
What did you do with your dog?
Four days.  I left to think.
Where have you been for a week?!
A blueprint spool.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
What?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
Why does he have a lock on his door?
He never answers.
He doesn't answer.
What are you doing?
Where he always is.
Where is he?
Lock the door behind you.
You let him pierce his nose?
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You should lock your doors.
I could use the money.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I wasn't sure.
Don't even...I'm there.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
You got the money?
You got any weed?
Nothing.
Does Alyssa know?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
No.
Been thinking?
The payoff.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
What the fuck?
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
What are you talking about?
Who?
He said he heard hammering.
I feel in love with George again.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Sam took them to a movie.
Where are the kids?
Please don't leave me.
That's the problem.
I never asked for more.
Despite you.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
You never really trusted me.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
What are you doing home?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
I know.
I was talking about our marriage.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You can't go because of Sam?
I can't go right now.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
What?
I'm helping George build his house.
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
After the kids are back in school.
Sooner than the Fall.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
The biggest waste of time since television.
We should take a vacation.
To shave your chest?
I'd be you.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
It would worry me.
Should I?
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
I'll make you something.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
We've eaten.
A man he respects.
His father is a man.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
Do you like red?
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Either do you.
You don't look like you.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Do it now!
Take it off.
No.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Okay.
I guess I could teach you some things.
No.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Why?
I've missed you guys.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
You got a dog?
Hey.
Hey.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
This is what he wants.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Yeah.
You're sure about this?
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
I don't know what I'm doing.
The door was open.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
Can you stay for dinner?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
I didn't go in your room.
What are you doing in my room?
In the bedroom.
Dad's home, already?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Nothing R, okay?
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Yes, it is.
Adam, that's not true!
Someone stop her!
I brought a few of my own.
Can we really help build a house?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
All day again?
I just thought it would be nice.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Dad said it first.
What did you say?
Queer.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Why?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Better make it a week.
A night in the hole?
That's my girl.
Nigger.
No, nigger.
Nagger?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
He's a big one.
And the baby?
She's doing just fine.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
Not for me, it ain't.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
These are free papers.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
But you can't.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Sharp.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Yeah...
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Then what's the problem?
No, but...
Is Spanky here?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Want me to come back some other time?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Take care of me?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
Married?
She got married last month.
Why not?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She's alright, isn't she?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Yeah.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Sure, boss.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Goodnight, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
I'll be right back.
Yes, sir.
You know I trust you, Claude.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
Yes, boss.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Comfortable?
Here!
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I got it... boss.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
But I'm having a good time...
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Engagement ring!
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Can't you remember your own name?
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
That's because I've never been here before.
I've never seen you in here before.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I know you're not talking to me...
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Yeah? You and what army?
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
They're touching.
So?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Gimme that damn thing.
You didn't get ketchup?
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
Why the hell not?
I can't eat this.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
It's too late for plans.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
'Course I was right. About what?
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
I said you're soft.
What'd you say?
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
I can't do it.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
No, I'm gonna kill him --
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
You sure it was him?
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Don't make me take them away from you.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Back to New York for starters.
Go where, Ray?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Don't touch that car.
What the hell are you doing?
Goodnight, Ray.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
I'm not working on a plan.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
What?!
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
That was five years ago.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
That's the way it is.
Well, if that's the way it is...
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Crop duster.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
Make 'em throw strikes.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Let it go, Claude.
Let me see that.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Whatever.
Crawfords.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Him?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
What am I gonna eat?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
I can't eat it with mustard.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
You get ketchup?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
I know people.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
The hell you talking about? What train?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Say what?
We'll just get off at the next stop.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Don't mention it.
I'm stuck!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
You drew this?!
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Let me take a look at that map.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
I said you're soft.
What'd you say?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Does that mean I'm in?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
No.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Yeah.
You still got that map?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
What do you want, Claude?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
Claude.
What's up, Ray?
I'm sure it don't.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Forget it.
What does that mean?
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
You know what I'm saying.
So?
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
No, man. I want you to have it.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
What about you, Radio?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
This fork is filthy.
He does it all by himself.
So?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
What ain't there?
It ain't here.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
He's dead.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
He even got my daddy's watch.
You lost all our money in a card game?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
What are you talking about?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
So you made a generous contribution.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
That jelly you were talking to right here?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
Still got that ten dollars?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Here I am.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Reward?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
What gave you that idea?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Alright. You want some pie?
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
I said you're soft.
What'd you say?
You're soft.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Oooh...
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Like this?
You need collateral.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Uh-huh.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
That's right, a loan officer.
A loan officer?
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Why didn't you take it?
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Nothing.
What?
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
That's some long green.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
What are they gonna do to us?
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Good old Monroe.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
You went to Monroe?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Claude Banks.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
I don't think so.
Don't I know you?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
'Preciate it. Claude.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
You ever done time before?
I'm all right.
How you doin'?
No problem. Oh, boy!
How about some steak sauce?
Made just for you, Cookie.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
You got your own nightclub?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
You killed Santa Claus?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
What is that?
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Movin' it out, boss.
Move it out.
All in, boss!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Where am I at, man?
Hey, Ray...
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
So it don't exist.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
What do you think about that?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Just like Elvis.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
What were they, bootleggers?
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
1932? That's like, that's like...
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
They gave me life, mama.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
I can't take that, mama.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
What are you doing here, mama?
Rayford!
Mama?
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
It'll be too late.
Wait for the firemen!
He must still be in there.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Is everyone here?
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
What's going on here?
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I prefer bourbon.
Lemonade?
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
She give you that scar, too?
Something like that, yes.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Satchmo.
Who?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Anybody else need anything read?
Appreciate it.
No, it says Marleen here.
Jenny?
Apparently, your sister died.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
They run but they never get too far.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
That's a long story...
What are you in for, Willie?
Me? Willie Long.
What's your name?
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Blacks welcome there?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
You found him.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
Understood.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Where'd you get this?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Absolutely not.
Now will you get in the flask?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Is this a joke?
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Little Nicky.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Let her go.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
He's sick?
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Please, get out of my mind!
You shouldn't have come here.
ADRIAN!
Don't do it!
No!
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
You mother...
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
All right. Let me out.
Hello, Cassius.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
It's our time, brother.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
We could create our own hell there.
What do you think about... Earth?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
That's what I thought!
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
It's just such a slap in the face.
And he's dead serious.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'm calling you out, brother...
Urr... uggg... errr...
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Uh. No it won't?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
And give you a good buzz.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Sure, why not?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Noon...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Show him Central Park.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I'll call her later.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
So excited.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
You're already there...
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
It would be so okay.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
What is it?
A speech impediment?
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Yeah, you do...
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
She's so nice.
Valerie's crying!
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
How did you see me?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Where did you meet my father?
Angels don't get any older, son.
How come you're not older?
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
An angel?
Try an angel.
My mom wasn't a goat?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Maybe try the opposite of that.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
Where is he? He's late.
No.
Did you just talk?
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
What's Nicky doing down there?
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
This is baloney!
I think you're looking at him.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I didn't murder anybody
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Release the evil?
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
What can I do about it?
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Well, let's rock and roll.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Put it in your mouth.
So far, so good. Now what?
That pain is hunger.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Makin' friends already.
Oh. Sorry.
It's not me, moron.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Everything's fine, pop.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Now you're talking.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
You did it for Namath.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Yes, Jimmy.
Knock, knock.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
You came through, Nicky.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Son, just do your best.
No. This can't be happening.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
So go get 'em, Dad!
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
How bad?
This is bad, Nicky.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
You're a good devil, Dad.
I was just playing with you.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Definitely.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
I mean... tough break.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Now everybody sit down.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Beast.
Bus?
You got it.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Thanks.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Hey.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Coulda been much worse.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Boogerland!
What was it called, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
It's Stanley, sir.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
I know, your wickedness.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You're not saying it's up to me?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Hey...
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Oh, would you grow up.
Easy, Liberace.
No.
By she, do you mean he?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
This don't look good.
Peppermint... alright.
Schnapps...
We know where to find Nicky.
Looking for the chief.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
You sure you're down with this?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Look who's back from the dead.
The Dark Prince is here.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Yeah. You do it.
Should we wake him up?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
What's with that guy?
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
There's our man.
'Bout time...
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
See ya, fellas.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Come on. One more time.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
That way.
Which way did he go?
I was DeNiro!
Yes, great movie...
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
You keep a bat under your seat?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You followed him?
So I followed him...
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I'll just go to Heaven.
You gotta kill yourself.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Dude. Seriously?
Good idea... kill me.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
All right...
Please. You got to.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
You got the wrong window again, man.
Andrew.
Adrian?
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
You smell like coconuts.
Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Do me.
From my dad's side of the family.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
That was Cassius!
Nicky!
I have to, Valerie.
Don't do it.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
East Rutherford.
We're going to Jersey?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
..."The Devil?"...
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Yes...
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
What do you mean, "possessed?"
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Why would you be floating?
I think I'm floating.
What are you doing?
No.
Are you dead?
Valerie?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
What were you thinking coming here?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Hey.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
What was that?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
Basically, yeah.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Good. I was concerned.
Sometimes, sure.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
My perfume?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
School?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
You have a dog? What kind?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
It's freezing my hands.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
"Octopus people?"
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
If you want to.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
My dad's an optometrist.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Why are you laughing?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Really?
The South.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
You think I'm a tourist?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
That just hurt a lot.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
If it's Cassius, yes.
A black guy?
It looks like the work of a brother...
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
I don't know.
Why is that funny?
Yeah. The deep South.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
No.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Off limits.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Yes. What is rent?
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
I don't know?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
See something you like, my man?
Hey...
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
I feel sorry for you, boy!
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
I'm a Sandman!
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
What other food?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
How did they get in here?
We're ready.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Up there.
How do you want us?
It'll be all right...
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
That's better.  How do you want us?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Answer the question!
You're a beautiful pair.
Where do you send them?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
From? From? From?
Where do you think we came from?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
How do you think we got here??!!
Anything to eat?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Your turn.
All right -- what are you?
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
Just the face.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
And I did it myself right on there.
Your own work?
I am.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Why did you do that???!!!
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Why did you do that??!!
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
It has nothing to do with you.
What's going on, Logan?!
At Carousel tonight?
I'm fine...  See you...
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
Anybody we know?
Of course.
Did you?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
What the hell took you so long?
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
That was a great shot you made.
I'm in my party mood.
Who invited you?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Well... you can't have them all.
You missed something special.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Just wondered... what happens?
Why?
Not in my time...
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Had enough?
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
When do you go up?
I'm very smart.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Here.
Where do you live, Mary?
I'm Mary 2.
What's your name?
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Is it inside the city?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
What does that water do?
Beloved wife...
Beloved husband...
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
And Sanctuary?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Things change!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
To what?
We can't. We're going back.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
One in a million, I suppose
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
It could be...
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Then the answer's yes...
Of course.
...But I still have the choice...?
You know, Jessica.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
What does it mean?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
I won't.
Don't ever let go.
I doubt it.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Don't!
We'll be all right...  We will...
I hate outside! I hate it!
And yours.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
What's that?
For us.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I'm afraid.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
What do you suppose this was...?
It's the only way.
How do we know this is the right way?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Will you take me with you?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
How will they know we're coming?
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
We'll convince them.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
They won't listen.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't believe us.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
He's good, isn't he?
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Are you taking me to them?
No. Not that either.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
I -- I can't.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
But what is this -- why?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Let's see -- how long has it been?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
I have.
Uh-uh.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
They're like beasts. Wild.
That's nice.
I'd rather be with you.
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
You're not going, are you?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Of course --
If you did know, you'd tell me.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I wish I could help you.
That's tomorrow.
What're you going to do?
What do you need?
Are you here to help me?
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I don't have much time.
Please? What friends?
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I don't..
I let him go... believe me.
And then you killed him, right?
A Runner gave it to me.
Where did you get that?
How can I?
It's different now. Help me.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
About running, dying what?
You know something.
Why tell me?
I'm going to run.
Why show me?
All right.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
You know.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Then it's still no.
Of course.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Maybe... sure...
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You could have called me yourself.
You're sure you don't want to try?
K.
What Quad do you live in?
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
Six. I go red next year.
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm not armed.  Well?
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm listening.
Not about that.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
How a Sandman lives.
About what?
Curious.
And now?
I changed my mind.
And?
I thought I had to do something.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
No.
Later.
No.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Jessica.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
He was killed.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Sad? What made you sad?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Well then...?
No.
You prefer women?
No.  Just no.
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
Please... No.
What's wrong, Available?
Oh, my...
Goodbye.
Where are you going?
Come with us.
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
At least it's over...
I'll make the arrangements.
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
What's that?
We'll have to bury him.
I don't know... but it does.
What people?
All this. All of it.
What belongs to the people?
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
No.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
I don't know.
What kind of jewel is this?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
Are you sure?
Yes...
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Do you want to see Doc?
Hello.
Hello, Sandman.
Oh my... I'll try.
Can you make it back?
Yes...
I'm sorry.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Oh, yes... I think...
Stay? They lived together all their years?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
That's better than gold when it's cold.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
And all alive you say?
More... many more.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Alive?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
We're leaving.
All right.
Not yet.
Are you ready to put him in?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
No, no, no
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
Where are they?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What makes you think so?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Have any other people ever passed through?
Gracious... no.
Are there any other humans?
I have always been here...
How did you get here?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
What kind of place is this?
For as long as I can remember.
How long have you been living here?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
Too little.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Well? How do you like it?
Sure, I'm okay.
I'm, okay... You okay?
Yeah.
Pete... You okay?
You okay?... What's wrong?
What?
You okay, man?
Pile in.
They're comin' with us.
What's happenin'?
No, I'm okay.
You want somethin'?
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Listen.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Okay.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Good... You up for a drive?
I don't think so.
You're not contagious are you?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Why not?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Why not?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
What do you mean by that?
I like to remember things my own way.
Yes, I thought my wife...
You're a musician?
This is our bedroom.
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Maid? Relative?
No.
No. Fred hates them.
Do you own a video camera?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
What is?
Very strange.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
What's that, Ed?
You know what I think?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Ours, Ed.
His or ours?
What a fuckin' job.
Yeah... Laurent.
You recognize that guy?
Yeah.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
Or not so recently?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Or something.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
As best we can.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Right... This just glided along.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Alice?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Where's the bathroom?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Alice...
Alice?
You killed him.
We killed him.
You all right?
Alice, I...
You got him.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Yes.
Are you my man?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Set.
Okay.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Okay...
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Yeah. Call him.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Andy?
So, should I call Andy?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
You liked it.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
In pornos?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
How'd it happen, Alice?
Pete... Don't...
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Yeah.
Pornos.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What deal?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
You like it?
I used to.
Have you partied with him?
No... no.
We should stop seeing each other.
I don't know.
So what do we do?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
Are you positive he knows?
He'll kill us.
Okay.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Hello.
I'll call you again.
Me, too.
Pete?
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Sure.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Okay...
I can't see you tonight.
Hi.
It's me...
Hello.
Okay, baby.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Can I call you?
Me, too.
I want more.
Over there.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
I don't know.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Yeah, I remember.
I was here yesterday.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
I don't. I don't know him.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Yes, I believe so.
Dick Laurent?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Andy, who is that guy?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sure.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
No.
Please tell me.
What happened to me?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Did you tell the police this?
Never saw him before in my life.
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Sheila?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Yeah? what did they want?
The police called us.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
You don't look so good.
Sit down.
What's up?
Sit down a minute.
Hey.
Do ya good.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
What night is that?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Yeah.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Okay. Thanks.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Better.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
No.
Have you made any charges against him?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
His physical condition.
His condition? What do you mean?
Yes.
The wife killer?
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
We saw you that night, Pete.
No... Here he comes.
You talk to him?
Out in back.
Where's Pete?
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
We'll get a tail put on him.
You just gonna let him go?
What's the word on the street?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
Did you ask him who he is?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Where is he now?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Repeat that, Bill.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Yeah, Mack?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Who is it?
No, sir, it's not.
That's not Fred Madison?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Pete, what happened to you?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
I want to see him.
He didn't come home.
What about yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I wouldn't know how.
He won't give his name.
Who is it?
Who was the man?
We know that.
Nothin'.
What's the matter?
No... I don't. Why?
Do you remember?
Coming up.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
A headache?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Not even close.
He's not Madison?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Who is this man?
I don't know yet.
What is this, Rogoff?
FUCKIN' "A".
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
No.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
I won't ever tailgate.
I... I didn't say anything...
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
The first night... Not the last two.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Tone deaf.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
What's your axe?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
There's no other bedroom?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
That's it.
But my head...
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
What is it?
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What's bothering you, Madison?
No, no. I want to go in.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
My... My head.
Something wrong?
Alice who?
Where's Alice?
That's absurd.
At your house.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
We've met before, haven't we?
No... of course not.
Was there?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I told you to stay in the car!
He's got some fucked up friends.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
What job?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
But...
Let's go home.
Just a minute.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Where would you feel safe?
Why would anyone do something like this?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What?
What was that?!!!
I wish I knew.
What the hell is going on?!
Thanks, guys.
We will.
Two detectives are coming out.
So?
All right.
We've got to call the police.
I guess so.
Don't you want to watch it?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
What's that? Another tape?
Who the hell owns that dog?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
You're up early.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
Yeah?
I had a dream about you last night...
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Called? When?
I called, you know.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
When you didn't come to the club.
What night?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Good book, huh?
Maybe.
It must be from a real estate agent.
No, nothing.
Does it say anything on the tape?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Who's it from?
A videotape.
What's that?
Wake me up when you get home.
That's why I married you.
I like to laugh, Fred.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
What are you going to do?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
The heart, I guess.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Which would you choose?
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
They're gonna cook him.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Yeah.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Okay.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Mr. Eddy?
You know who it is.
Who is this?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Hello.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
What?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Okay.
How ya doin', Pete?
You're my man, Pete.
It'll be ready.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
You will.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Suit yourself, champ.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Pornos?
You like pornos?
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
What'd I tell ya.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
At sixty?
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
I can see that.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
All right!
Give that a try.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
What's goin' on?
What?
We just killed a couple of people...
No. No, I don't.
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Sheila... Stop...
Go home, Sheila.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Hey... Sheila.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Sheila...
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Come on.
I didn't know you cared.
Yeah.
I was?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Where'd you come from?
I do like you, Sheila.
Why don't you like me?
Come on... get in.
I don't know.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
What do you want?
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Sheila?!
I don't want to talk about it...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
It was weird...
No... I told you.
You really don't remember?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
Sure. Sure I do.
You still care about me?
You were acting like a different person.
Whatiya mean?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Last time I saw you.
What night?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
I don't know.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Sorry... I...
Why haven't you called me?
Sure.
You want some company?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
What are you guys doin'?
Yeah.
Yeah?...
I missed you.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Yes, sir.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
All of it?
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Oh, read it!
Cable from Gainsford.
Yes.
Two years!?
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
What about those men we met this morning?
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Not even a radio?
Thank you.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
In a quandary.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Come on, Lovey.
They were in a quandary, and
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
There you are!
Certainly not!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Yeah. You know.
Horns?
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Okay, Lovey.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Just call me Barney.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Sounds like a stall to me.
Yes.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
The police?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Certainly not.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Have I?
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
Yes.
No kidding?
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
I'm thinking.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Will you stop squawking!
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Yes!
Where are they? Do you see them?
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
He might have lost his way.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Yes.
Oh, really?
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Look here
It certainly is.
Is it?
That's ridiculous.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Why, of course. Yes.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I see.
I see.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Good morning
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I beg your pardon.
Good morning, Lovey.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Don't call me brother.
Okay, brother.
Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Uh-huh.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sorry.
Not at all.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Uh-huh.
Found in Asia!
Well, what do you know about that!
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Oh, I see.
A paleontologist.
A what?
I'm a paleontologist.
Fossils, huh?
Fossils.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
All right.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Gold. You were going to
Huh?
Say, what about that gold deal?
Think of it! In times like these.
It's unbelievable.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Chalmers Bryant!
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
I'll say.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
What are we going to do?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Well, that's that, I guess.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Charming chap.
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
If you want me to!
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Why, you look beautiful.
Nothing. Why?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
No.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well - I'm
You mean you don't want to go?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
When are you going to start?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Leaving?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Look, Bob!
Hey - look!
Over by that hill.
Cave, eh? Where?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Suppose she should leave it?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Yes, charming.
Charming, isn't she?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Shall we have another?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The only one.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Very often.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
You're startled?
108 and still active?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Well, is it?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
He amputated his own leg?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
When was all this?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Who?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
buy and sell?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Centuries.
Well, it must have taken
They were.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
You have no disputes over women?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Oh, good heavens, no!
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
That's intelligent.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.
We follow many.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
In time you will meet them all.
Who, for instance?
Oh, yes.
So there are others?
Goodness, no!
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
And the wine - excellent.
Thank you.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Where is your mad pilot?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
How do you do?
And mine's Conway.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Please let me help you.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
What do you want?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Then it's done.
Oh, immediately.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Splendid!
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Now, what would you like to do?
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Why, no.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, I'm so glad.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Yes.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
No.
No porters here!!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
How can we get in touch with them?
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
Oh, dear.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Pardon me
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Hey!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Are you taking me?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
You're lying, aren't you?
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Yes.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Father Perrault is dead.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Sondra Bizet.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
What is it, my son?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Yes.
Are you the High Lama?
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
Do you think this will come in my time?
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Mine?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
was saying
What was that?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Come on! We're wasting time!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What about the others?
Yes, everything!
The clothes?
Yes.
You say the porters are waiting for us?
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
You're wrong, George.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
She came here in 1888!
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Why not?
You can't take her away from here!
She's going with me.
What's she got to do with it?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Maria?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
I'd go mad!
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Oh, George . . .
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Is that all my story meant to you?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
I don't need any proof.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
So you think I'm mad?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
You can't leave, George.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
Why - I'm sorry - but I
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
Porters?
What about the porters?
All right. Sorry, George.
Let me up! Let me up!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
George, come back!
Let me go, Bob!
George, what do you think you're doing?
Shhh!
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Uh-huh.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Well - I mean
That's what you said.
Did I say "if"?
What do you mean if we should get out?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
What's it mean?
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
Yes.
See that spot?
What is it?
Dead?
He's dead.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
What is it? Has he fainted?
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
Oh George, come on.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
What are these people?
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
George, what are you going to do?
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
Oh, stop it!
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants  and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Yes.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Yes, Bob.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Hurray!
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
You?
Just what I needed too.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Come on! Quick! This way.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Right, Bob.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Hello? Colonel?
Yes.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Yes.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
We'd be eternally grateful if you
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Where are we going? Huh?
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
What do you suggest?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
In for what?
I guess we're in for it.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
What if he refuses?
Good.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
Where were you hiding?
Why aren't you registered through our office?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Where did you come from?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Why?
I'd love it!
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
Why, mother?
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
I was just going to.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Why?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Struggling, why?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Why?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
You see, it's not a dream.
Ouch!
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Bump?
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
I wonder.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
I'm so glad.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
What is?
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I'm thirty.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Yes, I know.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Thank you.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Yes.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
A man whose life was empty!
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
That was easy. I read your books.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Was this your idea?
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
hope you'll forgive me for
My name's Sondra.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
Yes.  Barney!
You'll wait till you rot!
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Go? Where?
How about you? Do you want to go?
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
English!
Why, he's speaking English.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
What is it?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
What do you want him to do?
It's Fenner.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Thank you.
All right, I'll be there.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Perhaps.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Please don't go.
EXCUSE ME
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
And if I say yes?
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
I gotta be honest about something.
No. just peace on Earth.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
You got smeared.
I guess I lost:
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
What the hell...
...touch that.
It's not even a fucking door.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Cowan--
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Cowan--
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
The hell were you thinking?
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
You shot an eight year old girl.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Hesitated, sir.
The hell happened?
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
It'll make sense later?
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Yes, sir.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
What happens if I say no?
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Mrs. Edelson?
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
You think we're nuts.
We're the government, Cowan.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
They don't?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
You do?
All the time, sir.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Actually, sir--
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Well this didn't.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Kay...
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Yup.  Sure is.
Helluva night, isn't it?
Don't worry about it.
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
I wasn't scared...
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
What?  I thought you just--
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
I'd go with number three.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
You heard me.  You two, especially.
What?
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Sir, you can't just--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir--
Vayanse. You others, go on.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
What?  Who the hell are you?
We'll take it from here.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
There wasn't time, sport!
You coulda told me what you were doing.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
You were saying?
Kay!?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
In case I need it.
in case I need it?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Right.  Oh, and here.
Do his job.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
I'd double it and add 20.
Would you call this a code 100?
All of it?
It's marble.
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
For how long?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Since how long?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
What are you doing?
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
How does that help me?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
He's here to help!?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Kay--
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
What if he's telling the truth?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
The Pentagon.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
We're rising.
Jesus Christ...
Get back in the car!
Jesus...
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
I think that's what's happening...
You think that's what's-happening?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
The radio show?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
What's going on, Kay?
Where to?
Looks like a train ticket.
What?
And what's this ... ?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Gee.  You really think?
Something's wrong here.
There's a god damn good reason.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Hold it.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Now what?
A what?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
what's this?
Let's check am out.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
What?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Um-- Kay?
You don't know me at all.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Why?
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
It was a long time ago.-
Ha ha.  No, really.
I taught kindergarten.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
You don't know the half of it.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
She didn't even know you. .
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
So what's the problem?
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
Right.
It's a bug.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
We wear black.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Sure.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Yeah ... ?
They respond to fear, right?
What are you doing?
Are you sure you don't?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Out of focus?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Actually... I don't know.
What the hell does that mean?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What do we do?
So... how did they get here?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
When?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What is it?
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Why not?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Actually, you may have.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Do have any idea what I just said?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
So... how'd you hear about this?
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
You're not taking me in!
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
You figured what?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Maybe you need a closer look.
No.
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Goodwill...
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
How could it not?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
It's... coming.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
I dunno. One?
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Nowhere.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Actually, yeah--
Did he say where?
Noon exactly.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Yeah, Kay?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Nothing.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
This guy.  Where was he?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Found it.
I wanna make a deal.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Will it lower the curve?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
What if I don't?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
They're not my pals--
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
Wait-- listen--
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Which way?
The what?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Come again?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
May I have a look?
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
This it?
Scientific American?  Really?
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
How'd you know?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Yeah?  What's up?
Oh shit!
Actually, I don't know...
Did it leave?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Where's he making his big speech?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
They went right to the President.
And they're buying it?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
I'm getting a trajectory...
Dee?  What are you doing here?
They're gone.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
He's gone, too.
What the hell is going on?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Kay?  What's your 20?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Fine.  Good.
How's Dee?
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
RUN!
What --
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Oh, Jesus...
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
She's still alive?
She grew up.
She died?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
The other two will die without me.
Why?
I have to go back.
Someplace safe.
Where are we going?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Please, I want to go back...
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Anderton --
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
What is it?
Oh, God...
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Please --
I can't.  I have to know.
Anderton, leave.
He's here.
Wait.
Agatha...
He won't.
He'll turn around.
No.  Follow him.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Forget that guy --
Drop some money.
What?
Can you see the balloon man?
Agatha --
Agatha...
Take it.
Who?
They're inside.
What?
Is it now?
What?
Is it now?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Can you see?
Wally!
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
John?  What is it?
I know... I do, too...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Anne Lively...
About who?
Because I found out about her...
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Somewhere.
Found?  Where?
Just some guy... they found.
Then who was he?
-- but he didn't.
-- go blind.  I know.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
The nano... what?
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I can't even stand up --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Here --
How do I find the --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
You set your patients on fire!
They were performance pieces.
You made those tapes...
Yes, you did.
I put you away --
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
From where?  D.C.?
Oh, yes.
We know each other?
You don't remember me, do you?
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
It's all I could safely move.
That's not much.
Whatever you say, John.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Why?
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
And replace them with new ones.
Yeah --
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Right.  I know --
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That's comforting.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Lara --
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Try again.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
... Graveyard shift.
Hence the expression...
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
You the only sentry?
For that, we have to go for a ride.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Victim's a white female.
Drowning.
Kill type?
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
You the sentry?
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
No doubt.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
John --
Everybody runs.
You can't run --
I'm not getting halo'd.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
And who the hell is that?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
We won't let them.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I'm fine, Lamar.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
In the middle of the night?
I go running down there.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I'm fine.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
What?
Lara called me.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Tuck in your shirt.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Yes, sir.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
I understand.  Sir.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Don't apologize, John.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Hang on, Lamar --
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Uh-huh...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
The nation votes this week...
Don't worry, Lamar.
Tell me not to worry, John.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Everybody runs.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
I show a cop on horseback.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Uh, sir...
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
You're kidding, that's today?
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Seventeen minutes.
Take your time.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Confirm with trig and image.
That was easy.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Red Ball?
We're in motion on something.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Sir?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Did Marks close the front door?!
What?
Did he close the front door?
Go ahead.
Now look at him...
Yeah?  So?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Georgetown.
The mall?
No maglev system.
Somewhere near the capital?
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Run the subscription list...
We can't grab it...
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
You gonna tell on me?
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
You set me up...
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Flaws.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Just a nickname.
But you call this room the "temple".
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
If it's a question of authority.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
To them.
To Hineman?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Yes.
You're certain?
Because it was going to fall.
Why did you catch that?
Yes, it is.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You mind if I tag along?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Just go to the beginning!
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Are these all of her previsions?
Oh... Hi, John.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Wally, listen to me...
She said...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
She spoke to me.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She was looking right at me.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Uh, I'll try...
Rufus, play it back...
I guess that's all of it.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Tell me how.
Stop --
Then take her to Radio Shack.
They don't belong to anybody.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
So now I need you to hack into her.
So?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Are you reading my mind right now?
That's right.
She's a precog?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
I need help with her.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
I need your help.
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Hold your breath, Dad...
Sean, wait...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Who are you?
Good-bye, Dad...
I wanted to.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I was looking for you...
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I forgive you...
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Sean --
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Oh, Sean --
No.  He got tired of pretending.
You're alive?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
What the hell.
Wanna hear something funny?
It's a little late for that.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Sean -- you're not real.
All right, I'll try...
Come on!
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Okay... now let me time you.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I won!
That's great.
I scored a goal!
Good-bye, Crow.
You're not gonna kill me...
Let go of the gun.
Tell me!
Kill me!
Who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
What about the picture --
What the fuck is going on?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Who said I would?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
The precogs were wrong.
But you have to.  They said you would.
No.
You're not gonna kill me?
NO!
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
He's alive?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Some -- somebody's father?
Do you know who I am?
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
The female.
Which one is that?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
How do I even know which one has it?
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
You're insane or you think I am.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
-- and then walk out.
If... you have one.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Where?
The safest place of all.
What safe place is that?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You said they're destroyed.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Why should I trust you?
Hold that thought.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
You want to bring it down.
Do you?  Really?
I believe in that system...
The system would collapse.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Why?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
What?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
So you won't help me?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Not if I stay away from him.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
You say some of the children died?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And how did Lamar become involved?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
You're talking about the precogs...
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Heal who?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You don't seem all that proud.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
What's so funny?
And how would I know that?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
I'm... not... a... killer.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
The what?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
I'm a little dizzy...
Something wrong?
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Then how did he --
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Oh, God, what did you do?
He's dead, Lara.
John?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Lamar --
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
I understand.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Sean --
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He also said Crow was a fake.
We know why John was tagged.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
I don't know who that is.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Who?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
I thought you were retiring?
It's insanity around here.
You look great.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
This is all my fault.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
How did you get this?
My God...
Congratulations, sir.
I'll be right there.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Not.  Now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Tell him not now.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
What?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Yes.
So there is a way to fool the system?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Precog Deja Vu...
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
How?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
This murder is happening at two different times.
I don't understand --
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Not quite.
It's the same prevision.
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Wait, just a second...
Good God.  What was that?
Where are you?
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
What?
Lamar, I found something.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
He's my subordinate!
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
None of your damn business.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Right here.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
I wanna kill my boss.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
None.  This was arranged.
How many?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I don't know, why?
There a maid in this hotel?
No.  He can't...
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
We can stop him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
Two?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
They're everywhere.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Yes, I know.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
What?!
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Can't they shut that off?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
John Anderton was my friend!
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Knott!
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
I think you're swell company, Knott.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
I forgot my glasses.
Howard --
Sure.  Raincheck.
Raincheck?
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
We could have lunch together.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
What about your meeting?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Who?
He looks familiar.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
To what?  Trap him?
You know I need to use you.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
What was it then?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Yes.
But John was with him at the pool?
It was nobody's fault.
You mean after he lost your son.
Since right after we lost our son.
Have you been there recently?
That was our apartment.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
I don't have any sugar either.
He's not here now, is he?
We used to, every summer.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Cream and sugar.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I like it.
Yes.
This your work?
I know who you are.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Jesus...
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
But there's still the other two.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
What does he want with a precog?
They've never been separated before.
Tell me how all this works.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Good luck.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
What are you talking about?
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
You sure? I just made it.
No thank you.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
Yeah.
You're Bobby, right?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
We have snifters
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
When served warm --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
See you later.
It's on West Broadway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Women?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
As far as...?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Thank you, sir.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
What if I gave you forty?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
All the suites are about the same.
Is it the good room?
What, sir?
So?
Thank you very much, sir.
Yeah. Take it.
Are you sure?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Not on me, sir.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
I can take you down there.
Is it a good room?
Yes, sir.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
What's 'incidentals?'
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
So you're models?
We're in Fashion.
I don't get it. What do you do?
No.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Manhattan.
So, wait, you're from where?
Come on. Let's go.
We used to take baths together.
Oh no. What is it this time.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
I know.
He's alright.
He's great, right. Is he great?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Should I fuck him?
He's okay.
Is he cute?
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
Holy shit.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
Bullshit.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
No more.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Bullshit.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
What the fuck was that about?
I love you. Come home.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
What time is it there?
No.
Mommy's not home?
I don't know.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Uncle Bobby?
Chloe?
Hello.
I want spaghettis.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
You're not my daddy.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
He's not doing it.
What's wrong, baby?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
No.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
It's daytime.
She's, uh, sleeping.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Ricky's not wearing one.
I want you to take her with you.
What'd you say?
Take her.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Goodbye, Bobby.
How could you let her see this?
I never promised you anything.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Max offered to stake me.
With what?
I'll support you.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I want you to quit.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Ho's a good guy --
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Go.
Yeah? You sure?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I feel weird asking him.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
You talk to Max today?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
I'm ready.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Who's watching the baby?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Oh, please.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Oh my god. What happened?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Where were you?
Honey?
I don't get it.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Your dance is over.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Get your hands off of her.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
I said no touching.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
But what about them?
There's no touching.
Whu --
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
Where's Ricky.
This is it.
That's it.
That it?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
How so?
Ricky's taken care of.
Where's Ricky?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where we going?
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Heard of them.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
He must have that shit troughed.
Yeah?
Brooklyn.
No.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Where is this happening?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
So what do we do?
Yeah.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
What's that?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Shit.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
When's it going down?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
How bad is it?
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
So, when's the drop.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
What's his name?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
He making the drop?
Yeah. Where is he?
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Excuse --
Get away from her.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
She'll be out in a minute.
Yeah.
You driving her?
What's up? Jess ready?
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
5-5-1.
What's your record at?
Draw.
Well, you look it. You win?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Take a few days --
There won't be a next thing.
Yes. Goodbye.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
You want --
What is it?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yeah. Sure.
You vouch for him?
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He'll work it off.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
You told him you liked him.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Ruiz knows about this?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Yeah.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah. Sorry.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I know.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
No.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
I don't understand.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Then what are you saying?
I didn't say that.
So, that's it. I'm out?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
What?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
I'll work it off.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
They were out of line --
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
She was fast, huh?
A million. Easy.
Pshhh...
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
This one?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Why?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Me? No. Not really.
You bet the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
You like the ponies?
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Where's the drop?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
What's the plan?
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
A bad heart.
Nah, man...
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Good morning.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
We get it. We're sorry.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
What drill?
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Taken care of?
Ricky's taken care of.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Yeah.
Understand me?
Yeah?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
'Trustafarians?'
Depends what night.
Yeah.
Spa?
No. That's cool, man.
I can wait around if you want.
Well, this is the corner.
No. Just the cross streets.
You don't know where you're going?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Soho.
Where is the Soho Grand?
Traveling light. I like that.
Nah.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
What's that?
Bobby.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
It's important.
I'm on the phone.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Thanks.
Any time, bro.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Sorry, man, but...
He's not here.
Can you check?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Ruiz isn't here.
We're with Ruiz.
I'll be a minute.
No. I'll wait here.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Dude, we were practically made...
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Easy...
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
You're not getting a gun.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Where do you get this shit?
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go now and wait.
So what do we do?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
No more, man.
It's gonna be fine.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
I'm sorry...
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Calm down.
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
What about it?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
You did?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Eighty five.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty.
What do you have left?
No.
You're out of money?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Why?
Float me a hundred bucks.
It was six in the fucking morning.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Wanna bet?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
All the more reason.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
I'm pretty sure we do.
We don't need guns.
We need guns.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Did you hear what he just said?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
The penguin house.
The what?
Let's check out the penguins.
I'm your soldier.
Let's do it.
You want us strapped, don't you?
Nothing, man.
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
C'mon, man...
Put that shit out...
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
You gonna shank him in the shower?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
What are you doing.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
We're not getting whacked.
We're getting whacked.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Where?
He wants to see us now.
What's up?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
She was jonesing for me.
What the fuck was that about?
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What the hell did you do?
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
What the fuck's going on?
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Fine.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
You got that right.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You fucking nuts?
Back in.
Where do you think you're going?
Fuck this.
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
You too?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
About what?
You happy?
So we're working?
Yeah.
You would think.
He woulda told us right?
Like I said, I don't know.
So is this the drop?
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Yeah. What vibe?
What did I 'get?'
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
I don't know.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
You know this guy?
You got something to say --
I mean, that's what I heard --
What the fuck is that supposed --
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Motherfucker...
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Don't even start.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
What the fuck do you...
This is bullshit, man.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
So they said more than the address.
They asked who it was.
How'd they know who you were?
Nothing.
Nothing else.
I told you what they said.
They didn't say an address?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
What exactly did they say?
Fuck...
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
Well, I don't want to walk.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Oh really. Why's that?
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Great. On my fucking room.
Yeah, I guess.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Forty-six.
How much was it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
How much is it?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
C'mon, man...
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Who you calling?
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
You sure?
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
No. Look. There.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Nah, don't bother --
I'll get the girl.
What's the movie?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Pretty nice.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
To keep?
It's ours.
She really liked the kitchen.
Is that the woman from..?
Right here's fine.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
I don't know.
Who's driving her?
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
What? Did she say something?
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Seat belt.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Nice work.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
What are we delivering?
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Fuck him.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
We look good this year.
Sorry coach.
Sorry coach.
I'll beat your ass --
You wanna go right now?
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Bullshit...
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
He implied it.
He didn't say we need guns.
I think we might.
We don't need guns.
We need guns.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
Shhh...
Fuck them.
Then why do you try to get in?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I thought you hate that club.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Bye.
I'll page you with the number.
I will.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I got no idea.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I know the number.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Yeah. I know the number.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
It's not losing record.
So, it's not a winning record.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it was a draw.
So?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
What are you saying?
What about it?
What about boxing?
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
Fuck...
C'mon...
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Bobby and Ricky.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Tom. How's it going?
Hey, boys.
I didn't do anything --
I want to leave right now.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
You want to come splash around.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
Yeah. I want it.
You want your surprise?
Where's the surprise?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Kinda. Yeah.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
He's on the list.
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
What?
Cardiff Giant?
You see a Ricky Slade?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
The line's over there.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Cool.
Cool. See you later.
You look good, man.
A little.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
S'up.
What's up, man.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Drinks are free, right?
Yes?
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
The videos.
How much is what?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Ugh...
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
I'm half Irish.
Watch it...
Ow, shit...
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Stop.
You really in trouble?
See you later.
What? Why am I bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Why? What I say bad?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
It means you got a gun?
'Strapped?'
You strapped?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Where's Spa.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Come, now. You just got here.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
How's it going?
Here they are, then.
Here...
No, really, mate?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
That shouldn't be a problem.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Coke?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
What do you want?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
You want another drink?
Does anyone want another?
No shit?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
No?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
And where is...?
Word.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Nah, man...
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Good morning.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Yeah.
Different.
I call 'em wiggers.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
A lot of Persians?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
No. What is it?
You know my pager number?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
So you're our own private guy?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
So whenever we want...
You'll love it.
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
The Soho Grand?
Is it nice?
Soho Grand, right?
Ricky.
You rode?
Thanks.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
We're square.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Four fernet.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Sure. You boys want anything?
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Yes, sir.
We're square.
But, Max --
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
Goodbye.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
So tell me how it is.
Don't worry. I get it.
Tell me.
I get it.
Yes.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
What about my keys?
What?
Keys.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Yeah.
And where do we bring it?
That money is your per diem.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Yes. You're going to New York.
We're going to New York?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
Can I borrow a piece of --
That's none of your fucking business.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
What?
Yeah.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
The Red Dragon.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Who's gonna outfit us?
He has a cute what...?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
No...
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
She poured it for --
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
It's a digestif.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
No. I'll take a strega.
Who's up for a night on the town.
I'll get it.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Dip?
A rose by any other name would --
I am.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Scotland.
And where might that be?
Edinburgh.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
Yeah.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
That really you, Red?
Take it easy, baby.
Now.
Let Billie finish.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
There's two guns on you.
I'm wearing, Archie.
I don't want your money.
I'll give you back the 600.
You know it.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
You're a damn liar.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
The bitch was there.
You never had it.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You owe me six big ones.
What you talking?
Daddy, where's my money?
I'll take your goddam bet.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Bet you are.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
Nnnnnnn!
It hit?
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
I'm working on it.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Solid, daddy.
How's it feel?
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
What?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
Just now.
When?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Why?
Yes, sir.
Did you just now con me?
Yes, sir.
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
Lemme write it down for you.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Where can I get a hold of you?
I like you, country.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Is your papa West Indian?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
How 'bout that?
Man's rep travels.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Where I come from. Boston.
Heard where?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Keeps me out of the army.
Bet you like that shit.
I'm working trains. Selling.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
What they call you?
He had it coming.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
What you say?
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Man live by his rep.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
I want to. God knows I want to.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
I don't know how.
Tell Him that.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
I don't know what to say to Allah.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I can't.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
I will do it.
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
The body is a holy repository.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
I sure met some.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
Then the devil is white.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
Who are you?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
Little.
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Read it and keep on reading.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Where am I gonna start?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
I can't make out that shit.
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
What the hell for, man?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
What for?
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
What? Everybody knows God is White.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
That's what Mama used to say.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
What do you do with your time?
Don't con me.
Okay, okay.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
Elijah who?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
You ain't lying.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
What did you give it to me for then?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Man, what do you want?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Who the hell are you?
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Do you?
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
What can I do for you?
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Make it plain.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Next week, Brother Minister.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
No, Brother Minister.
Is the program ready?
Come, sit with us.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Dear heart, where are you?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Betty it's me. It's me.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Dear heart, I love you.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Shhh!
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
You have to sleep for three.
Get some sleep.
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
What do you want me to do?
We need you too!
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
The talk is everywhere!
Talk about what?
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I just want to sit here and be still.
I'm not made of glass.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
How do you know?
Because you're in trouble.
Why are you looking at me like that?
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
What do you think?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
You're with me even when you're away.
I'll be away a lot.
Hush your mouth.
It will be rough.
Just hold me.
It won't be easy.
I love you.
Yes. Did you eat?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Did you hear what I said?
Yes.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I know.
I'm in Detroit.
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
What have you set your mind to?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Are you?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
How old are you, Betty?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
Just an idle question.
Why do you ask?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
You have enough worries of your own.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
I can handle it.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Let's talk about you for a change.
Delicious.
How do you like it?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
What?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Could we sit down someplace?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I see your point.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
What points?
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
If you want to tell me.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
She ate.
What?
Down front as always.
Is my family here yet?
Let's cancel.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
What did I tell you about assuming?
I assumed...
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Let some of us come down there.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Brother Earl.
Let's get out of this cold.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
I'm tired of praying.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Just what are you saying?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Then we don't know that God was white.
I told you we don't know for certain.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Just what is your question?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
That's right.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
I don't think we know for certain.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
Why don't you just ask your question?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Let him finish.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
Entirely.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
You put it very well.
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Please, go ahead.
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Yes, sir, I did.
Did you see the papers today?
Allah Akbar.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Let me do it then.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
If you want to tell me.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
Say what you're saying.
"His greatest greatness."
What?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Sure, man.
Can I ask you something?
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Is she hooking?
If she got eyes, she do.
She know?
With him?
'Bout every other night, Red.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
You know that gal?
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
And like a fool I believe it.
I say a lot of things.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Let's go.
I do know I love you.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
I know where you're going.
I mean it's late, baby.
I ain't stupid.
I better not come in.
Now you come back.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Did you hear me?!
Your control over your children, therefore --
Get out.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Murder.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
And don't come back.
You're my father.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Let me die then.
No. You'll be marked for death.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
What does Sidney say?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
What mission?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
How long has this been going on?
Another one?
Please make way, please --
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
500.
How many you turning out?
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
You had the number.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Me?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
What's your story, baby?
You evil this morning.
You better believe it.
You the man.
You hear me, girl?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
C'mere.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
...That isn't a whore?
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Yeah.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
You the man!
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Tell him about Baldy.
That ain't bad.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
I ain't doing bad.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
You're too small to be Bogart.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
The hell you are.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Eat lead, coppers.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Fine as May wine.
That's a fine chick.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Well, all reet, then.
Well, all right, then.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
I'm the man.
Head nigger in charge?
That's right.
You want to be the head man?
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
Might be all right.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
So what about him?
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
What can you do?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Who the hell are they?
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Allah will provide.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Are you sure?
Yes sir.
He told you that?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
They talked about me like
He's bright.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
I'm not... easy.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
So you are going to talk me to death.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
I don't know shit about you.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
What do you want?
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Am I a suspect?
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
No.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
What am I doing here?
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
[Senor?]
[I have a friend there.]
[Why?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[South America.]
[Where are you coming from?]
Where?
Deal.
I show, you give me the information?
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
Give me the address.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
Where does he live?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Where do I find you?
I have connections.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
So what do I get in return?
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
So where do we begin?
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
It's a little late.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
A lot of people are looking for you.
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[What is his name?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Daniel what?]
[Daniel.]
[What is his name?]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[Si.]
[Reina Rosas.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[What money?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Who's the boss?]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[No!]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[The what?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Who pays you?]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[How does it work?]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[So am I, Sister.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
Who's he?
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[Who's he?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I believe you.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[Where do I find him?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Ordered by who?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[Who are you?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Drive.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Her life for your life.]
[What do you mean?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[I want you.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[How much do you want?]
[I want you.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[You stole the drop.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[And?]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Lucky how?]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[Please, don't...]
[Correct!]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
And what if amateurs try it?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
How does it affect you?
I drink.
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
It's loaded.
Is it loaded?
Have you used this type before?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
What is it?
Show me, please.
Yes.
Were you provided with a gun?
Different door. Not far from here.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Yes or no?
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
Pinta...
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
I said the plan was right here.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Creasy?
Maybe...
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
You mean a misfire?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
I came to visit you.
What are you doing here?
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You did something on impulse?
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
How long you staying, Crease?
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
You been working?
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Yeah, right...
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
So how's business?
Don't give me that bullshit.
Nothing wrong.
So what's wrong?
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
What do you mean, I'm here?
I'm here.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
You got that right.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Dyslexic?
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Be a swimmer.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Then be trained.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Frank. Frankie.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You think too much?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Still not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
That's not a question.
You don't drink like you used to.
Could I stop you?
Could I ask you a question?
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
The blocks.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
Your father has business.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
The gunshot holds no fear.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
Are you afraid of me?
I know you're not.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
I dropped her at home.
Where's my mother?
You were never late before, I was worried.
I'm sorry.
You're late.
Yeah. Two or three.
Did you used to?
No.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Yes.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Don't worry. You will.
I don't understand.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
No, that was in Columbia.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
You feel sorry for the husband?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Why do you ask?
You need to practice.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
In a week you should be fine.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Yes.
Did you sleep alright?
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Do you always sleep with him?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
My ankle.
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Everywhere!
Where?
It hurts.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
They'll be back in a week.
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
It's better to be free, right?
Well, I let him go.
How do you think he got out?
No.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Do you think he'll come back?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
What are you doing?
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
You're fast.
I go to school, don't I?
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
I'm not crying.
And don't start crying.
Oh...
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
So you were unhappy?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Hmmm?
But why not?
No.
Not at all?
No.
Did you like school, Creasy?
That's right.
We're taking a different way home.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Time will tell.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
I'm a bargain.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Potential? I don't understand.
I'm looking for potential.
Why not?
No.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
I know. But which state?
The United States.
Where are you from, Creasy?
Creasy...
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
Who's Emilio?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
If they like me.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Creasy... Wait.
Then don't come.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
I don't believe you.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Planned what?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Because...  I was already dead.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Jordan!
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Sorry.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
It makes it all seem so serious.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
No.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
I'm fine.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
Never.
You've done much of this work before?
So are you.
You're American.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
What was her name?
Last night. Do you know something?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Where are you?
It's Creasy.
Rosanna Guerrero.
She understands men.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
For a year?
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Do you know what she told me last night?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[No. Why?]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[Yes.]
[You have the money.]
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
Bye, Mom.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
You do?
I like him, Mom.
This is Mr. Creasy.
Yes, mom?
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
When?
Good news. You're going back to school.
I'm trying, mom.
You should be sleeping, baby.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
She's young. She'll get over it.
It will be a hard break.
He has to go.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It's not.
That's ridiculous.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
Creasy.
What? Who?
He has to go, Samuel.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Hmm?
She likes him.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's nice he's American.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Our daughter.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
[Who's that?]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[A beautiful circle.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[And left three more dead men.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[Is that good or bad?]
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
And they took that away.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
What was she to Creasy then?
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
I can take care of myself.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
That's what friends do.
You helped him get this job.
Two tourists who never went home.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
I already ate.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
So am I.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
He's not a cop killer.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
What?
Hey, Herbie...
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
We just talked.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Are you kidding?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Who you gonna call?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Where you going?
All right, I'll see you!
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
It must be one o'clock.
It's early.
What for?
You want me to ride down with you?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Waddaya gonna do now?
I been looking all over for you!
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Down there. That little one there.
Where?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I'll call her up.
Yeah, sure.
I could see she likes you.
What makes you say that?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
Oh, yeah.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Which one was that?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
She wasn't so bad.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Who told you that?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Were the lights on?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Your son Marty?
Marty.
Who?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Catherine, my sister...
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
I know it pains.
It pains that they should do this.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
What they say?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
When was this?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Who?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Ah?
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Ufa!
She gave me the evil eye.
What happen?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You told me.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Well, it ain't your baby.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
It's her baby too, you know.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Who?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
I don't think I remember him.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Oh.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
That's nice.
I feel fine.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I came to see you. How you feel?
Hey! What are you doing here?
Okay.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Okay.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
We just live one flight up.
You got an elevator in this house?
How do you do?
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Nothing.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
All right.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
I'll wait for your call.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
I'd like that very much.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Nothing.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Marty...
Please...
No...
Please...
No...
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Marty...
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
No, Marty, please...
Maybe that would be a good idea.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Oh, I'm fine.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
Come on inna dining room.
Yes, I know.
This is the kitchen.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I really should get home...
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Wadda you think?
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
I don't.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Yes, I know.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Yes, I know.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Thank you.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
I'm thirty-four.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
I'm having a very good time, too.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
Yeah.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
You come up here often?
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Sure.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
No, I'm not kidding.
Are you kidding?
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
What?
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
I'm stag.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
You say something?
I'll see you.
I'll see you around.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Where you going now?
I'm just here with another girl.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
Oh, that's a sad story.
That's the one.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
About eight o'clock.
What time is it?
I never thoughta that.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Sure. This girl said...
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Don't worry about it.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Sure, what?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
What didn't you like about her?
Don't bring her to the house no more.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
I don't like her.
She didn't look Italian to me.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't know. I don't think so.
I said, is she Italian girl?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
What, Ma?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
I heard you, Ma.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
Sure.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
Sure.
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
Sure.
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Ma! Leave me alone!
Marty...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
You not ugly.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Put on your blue suit...
So I'll die without a son.
You gonna die without a son.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Marty...
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
You gonna get married.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Tomatoes.
It's loaded with what?
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
What?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
You gotta good heart.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Hello, Ma.
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
This is a good deal here, Marty.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Hiya.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Hello, Ralph.
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
What nurses?
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hiya, Ralph...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
You want a beer, Ang'?
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hey, Ang'...
So these two girls come over to the bar...
You should be ashamed of yourself.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Well...
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
Hello, Thomas.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Right.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Sure.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Sure, sure.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
I'm gonna see you tonight...
On accounta...
That's all right, that's all right...
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
Well...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Sure.
Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
He coming home right now.
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Waddaya talking about?!!
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Wadda you so sore about?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Tommy...
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
I don't wanna talk about it!
Tommy...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Tommy!
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Okay.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
What do you want me to do?
He's parted his moorings.
You talked to Walt?
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
What are you going to do with him?
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
How you, Radar?
Yes, O'Reilly?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Just one for a start.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Never this close.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
They give you copies to burn.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Y'all mind the store.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Or her figger.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
There's only one way.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Not enough to be a pro.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Epidural hematoma?
Look at that right eye.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Miss you, Walt.
Pour one for Painless.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Don't you use olives?
No.  Or why you should.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Back home.
Which hospital?
Hospital.
Where?
That's right.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Home.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Us. Lead us not into...
You make a mean martini, kid.
So long, Ho-Jon.
Same general idea.
Wisconsin.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
I don't drink intoxicants.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
What the hell's going on here?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
Perfectionist.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
We got to stop them right here.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
What?
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
We could steal one of the choppers.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Be right with you.
Any time. Whenever we want.
When?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Same here. You can retire my number.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Yeah, if I can.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Never heard of him.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
An application to Androscoggin College.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
When will he be able to write?
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Never mind. Forget it.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
Y'all just act natural.
What do you think, Trapper?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Call Dago Red.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Sixteen times.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
And it's the ninth inning.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
The chest-cutter.
What's that?
Except we forgot one other small thing.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
We been had.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
I got some.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
You got directions?
Duke Forrest.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
I can't... couldn't.
Wait a second...
Don't stop now! Please...
Frank...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Ravenous. What about you?
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
We think the same way.
We're a good team.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
People will talk.
I have a tent to myself.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
I was just asking...
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Give us this day our daily...
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Is that liquor?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
But what about Major Houlihan?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
A football game?
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I think I heard about that.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
And there it is.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
Right.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
You betcher ass, General.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
What?
You betcher ass, Dad.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Gimme three.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
Radar!
I found a doner.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
C-A-M-E-M...?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
What for?
Not necessarily.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
He can move in here with us.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
He only lasted one season.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
They're coming.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
What do we do?
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
I don't get it.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't feel anything.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
It's in pretty deep.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
For you, Trapper.
Radar!
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Is he out?
What's the age of consent in this country?
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Look.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
No, no, that one.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
We stand behind all our work.
An eternal damnation.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Black capsule.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
I like an olive.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
That's right. We work well together.
All of them?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Hang in there.
It's possible
See you.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
What's the matter?
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
I think we could still have a chance.
The bastards outconned us.
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
You think he won't.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
You're asking for somebody else?
I didn't mean with me.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You're leaving tomorrow?
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Maria...
Even if I weren't.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Of course not.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Ayuh.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Same here.
Very happily married.
Something else we have in common.
But I'm married.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
You're an attractive man.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Our minds?
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
It isn't always this rough?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
How did you get called that?
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
Why would he do that?
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Yeah!
You really say the cutest things.
I didn't have much choice.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Duke...
Second pint.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Glad to help.
Thanks.
They missed the boat.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Yes, Reverend?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Let's get his clothes off quick.
He's coming to.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
What's wrong with him?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's the story?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Why can't you look at him?
That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
The one and only.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
How much time do I have?
You guys got any black capsules?
In the direction you want to go.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Just in dreams?
No, never in the slightest.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Homosexuality.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
There's only one worth noticing.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I don't think so either.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
That. It's out of the act.
I have not understood what you means.
You can cut the bow.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
About that chest-cutter...
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
Your tent?
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
The blonde dish.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
What's wrong with you?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, that's what I mean.
You mean who hit who?
What's going on? Who started this?
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Damn.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
I can try, sir.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Morning, Captain.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Good morning, Colonel.
Yes, Colonel.
Oh, get out of here!
Sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Yes, dammit, and...
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Yes, sir?
O'Reilly!
I out-coached that General Hammond.
What's that, Henry?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
They can't do that to me!
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
I used to throw the javelin.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Yeah?
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Good morning.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Now?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Never mind.
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
What's the bastard really like?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Boys, we're home free.
Nice.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Arterial silk.
Nice.
How is he?
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Did you get it, too?
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
You didn't?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Did you write this?
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butthere you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Yeah, that's the one.
Ted Sheldon.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
About me?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
No.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
No, thank you.
Can I help you pack?
Uh-huh.
Me?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Uh-huh . . .
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Hello.
Hello, John.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Oh. Yeah.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Who?
John Doe. The one in there. 
Who?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
No.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Yes!
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
You got me.
Against anything. Just protest.
Against what?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
With all of it?
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Um-hum.
Action?
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Are you all right?
Huh?
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Yeah, maybe.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
Hello?
Mr. D. B. Norton!
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
A third party?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Oh!
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Better let me talk to him.
Yes, sir.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Thank you very much for everything.
How do you do.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
A hundred dollars!
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Money.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Thirty dollars.
How much money do you get?
Yes, sir.
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Oh.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
That's good.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
All set, Ann?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
You bet I will, Ma.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Huh?
Wait a minute . . .
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
What?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
The Websters!
The Websters.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Thank you.
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
What's the idea?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
Awwwww!
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Take it easy, John Doe.
Okay, fellows.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
I got it all ready. Here.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Oh!
Duets? But can we trust him?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Well, maybe you're right.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
All right, boys, here he is.
Right here. Sit down.
Oh.
Hurry up, Pop.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
That's our man. He's made to order.
I wish he had a family, though.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Looks all right
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Sorry.
I can read. I can read!
What bonus?
Plus a bonus.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Who, for instance?
Well, you're catching on.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
What John Doe?
John Doe.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
So?
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
A deal?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
What John Doe?
John Doe.
In what man!
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
You made it up.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Say that again.
There is no letter.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
There is no letter.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Oh!
The letter from John Doe.
What letter?
The letter.
What's that?
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Oh, let me go, will you!
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
He's watching the other door.
Where's Connell?
I ain't seen him for a week.
Have you seen him?
No.
Has he been here?
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Colonel!
That's
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
Where'd you play?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Baseball?
I used to pitch.
What do you do when you work?
Yeah, a little.
Had any schooling?
. . . Tubby?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Hey, Boss.
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Both of 'em?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Yeah, Boss?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
What do they want?
Look!
What?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Beany!
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Shut up!
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Go out and find her!
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Did you find her?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Where is she?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
St-rike!
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Ba-ll!
All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
Sure. Mostly often.
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Who are they?
The heelots!
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Who?
The heelots!
Who's got him?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
Naw.
Help yourself.
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Grubbel's here. See? 
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
A gag. A gag!
A what?
It must be some kind of a gag.
How could he be a fake? 
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
No!
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
John Doe Club?
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeh.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Four bits.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
The elevators are still runnin'.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Sure, you are.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Sure.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Yeah. It certainly is.
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Yeah, you bet!
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
You betcha.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
I trust him.
Yes. Sure.
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Whyuh
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Well?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Huh? Get what?
Well, I don't get it.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
I want it as soon as possible.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
How?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
What's your name?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
No.
How about family? Got any family?
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
What are you doing up here then?
No, I didn't.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
No, I didn't write it, but
Did you write itor didn't you?
What difference does that make?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Yes! I was paid! But the
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
That's a lie!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Is there anything wrong?
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Good night, John.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the
Did you want to see her about something important?
Oh!
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
She isn't?
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Flowers.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
It's for Ann . . .
Thanks.
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Okay.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Yeah.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
How?
I know one way you can do it.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Racket? What do you mean?
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
What do you mean, too bad?
That's too bad.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Nineteen!
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No, sir.
Is there a crowd in the street?
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
I didn't see anything.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Shh!
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
I'll take half of your action.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
What's the line?
Good. I don't want to be late.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
You want me to go up with you?
Apartment 306.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Where's the stereo?
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
No shit! He's good!
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Yeah, okay.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Deal.
Dinner's on you.
You're my hero.
Floor seats.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Not that we know of.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
I don't know.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
No -- you can't do that.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
SWAT wants to go in.
They're not usually graduate students.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Hello, guys.
Clarence Teal.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Of course.
Could I please have a little water?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
What happened? Is there a problem?
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Who is it?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
I won't get away with it.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Don't make do it, Mike.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You don't want to know.
What happened, Mike.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Is that where you're family lives?
I hate fucking Springfield.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Tell my dad.
Huh?
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
How can I help you with the particles?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Tell me what's wrong.
They want Walter dead!
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
Who's controlling your mind?
You can't help me, man.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
You got it.
Automatic.
Manual or automatic?
You want a convertible or hardtop?
What?!
You're gettin' the car.
Am I gettin' the car?
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Really?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
I need to get something straight first.
Where's the car?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
I what?
You signed out twice.
Is there a problem?
Hold on a second here.
Johnny who?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Who are you again?
Roper, we're into it...
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Roper...
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Being faxed over now.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
What do you got on Korda?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Anything on Korda so far?
I have to go face to face.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Earl.
What's the suspect's name?
That's right.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...a car.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Hi, Roper.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Yeah.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
Spread it out.
It's all there.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Satisfied?
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Open your shirt.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
You can't kill me like this.
I'll give you something.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
For now that's all.
Is that all?
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
Yep.
Are you in charge, Roper?
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
You don't have to come here.
Stay put.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
McCall, you all right?
Good question.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
That's a chance I gotta take.
So what do you want to do?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
And what if you can't live with it?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what about the ones you don't save?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
How many have you lost?
That it is.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Pull up alongside.
You're crazy.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
What the fuck is going on.
Damnit!
He's got the girl.
And doing a very good job of it.
He's cutting down the visibility.
There's your answer. He's smart.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Occasionally you lose.
Is it always like this?
About six years. My partner took me.
How long you been coming here?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
How much you wanna bet?
We won.
We lost.
We won!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
The jockey!
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
Yeah, first and second.
They need to run first and second?
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
The 6 horse is still last.
To run late!
To run last?
That's okay. That's his style.
The 6 horse is last.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
Still needs work.
I'm just practicing my lying.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
Fine.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
I do.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
You're a compulsive gambler?
You know why I like the track?
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
Why did he do it?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
What did you see?
Okay, stop.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
To save lives.
Why?
Yes.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
You tell me.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
What's the first commandment?
Yes.
You know the ten commandments?
It's against my nature.
Get good at it.
I'm not good at lying.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
So what do I say to this guy?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
I can't do that.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
Tell me what you need.
It'll come. Try again.
No.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
I think so.
You think you can learn, McCall?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think I can handle that one.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Where did you hear that?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Do you really?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Every couple of months, huh?
We see each other every couple of months.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Explain how that works.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
You living together?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
I don't gamble.
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
Why? You like my ass?
You got a girlfriend?
Well, if I have to, I have to.
You have to. It's a tradition.
I don't really like to drink.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
Not the ones I'm at.
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
We could fill it with water.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
I'm not sure.
Is there something wrong with that?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
It was okay.
How did you like Toronto?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
You'd never been out of New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You don't like New York?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
National Marksman Competition.
Recruited you from where?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
What's the point of this?
Try to remember that.
I know.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I've rarely shot anyone.
It rarely has to be done.
Like it had to be done.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Only at the very end.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
If you say so.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
Sorry... Habit.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Is the hostage injured?
Only that floor.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Which apartment?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
My name's Scott Roper.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Let me show you something, Ray.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
I know how you feel, Ray.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Prude.
The hell I am!
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
You crazy? With all those people around?
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
...the hell are you talking about?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Scott...
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
A deeper level?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Yeah.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Hmm?
I've been thinking.
Hmm?
Scottie?
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Do it!
Scottie...
Stay here, don't move.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Scottie, Scottie...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Use your imagination.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
And you think he'll...
Korda escaped.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
...Let me just show you.
Yeah?
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
There is?
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
It's very nice.
You like this place?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
How's Paco doing?
Just now.
When?
It's okay. We broke up.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Scottie...
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Yeah that's it.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Mmm, needs a little something.
What do you think?
And it's hard to get.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
It's already started.
As a matter of fact, I do.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Ronnie...
If you did, you never showed it.
You think I didn't need you?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
What do you want from me?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
I've proved that, didn't I?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
That a new picture?
Can I come in?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
You heard.
Maybe you should be.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Hey.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Please. I'm begging you.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Greg.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
You worship yourself.
I worship you.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
SHIT!
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Where's the damn wire?!
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Stay up there, Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Come on!
Yeah, they are but...
Are these yours?
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
What have you promised them?
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Any verification on numbers.
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
What do we got?
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Who's running it!
Roper...
Who's running it?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
I want to be put on this case.
I can't do that.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
I'll provide you with transportation.
Repoed this morning.
What happened to your Trans Am?
The car is part of the deal.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
And a car.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
What do you think would be in order?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
You let us worry about that.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Your concern is heartwarming.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Define concern.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Depends. What's up?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What?
Roper.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Tell him to give me a raise.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
True.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
Yes, I believe he has --
God-Damn you!
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
They have nothing to do with this --
Yes.
There are two million people in there with you.
I need to take back what's mine.
What do you need?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you want?
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
This is Halden.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
Why --
Because I took it out of your memory.
How come I can't remember?
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
She said I have a son...
To live forever.
Why?
It's all been transferred.
Okay...
It's okay.
From the dream.
Wake up?!
It's time to wake up.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
What's happening?
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
But this is impossible.
Just like you always wanted.
Guests?
The guests are here.
Yes.
It's all here...
No...
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Who are you?!
About what?
You were right.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Do you believe in miracles?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Your life that bad?
-- No.
This is how you pick up women --
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
And down here --
Only up there in the dream they called life.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
One would assume so.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Yes.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Dream?!
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Yes...
You were the one who was dying.
Not real?
It's not real.
The new world.
In a computer program.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
In here I am.
You are not a God.
Yes.
Divinity?
So wrong --
Not my problem.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Then what?
No.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
True.  But why?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
-- He will.
But what if he doesn't --
It's his nature.
You sure he's going to come?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
And what about the reconfiguration?
Unfinished business.
Where the hell are you going?
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
The maze has been changed --
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
What about the customers with reservations?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
At least a day.
How long?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long 'till we can eject?
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Take care.
There is no --
The woman you're stuck on.
Who?
What's her name?
The weather.
What?
I'm South Dakota.
New York.
Where you plugged-in from?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Insurance?
Insurance.
Need the disk back!
Times Square.
Where?
An interface attendant.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Then where is she?
There was no need to kill her.
Try harder.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
To hide the evidence.
Why would I do that?
Then you had her killed.
Katie was digitized.
Not his style.
The truth.
What did he tell you?
-- Who did he digitize?!
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Who did he digitize?
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Good question.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
That's right.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
He wouldn't say.
Why?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
It's not used for anything.
A hotel?
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
What is it?
The truth.
What?
One condition.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
And you weren't involved.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
-- I saw the program.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Try harder.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
You're jumping to conclusions.
Go!
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
-- Yes.
He had access to the keys --
-- He won't.
Won't be time if he gets access --
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Two maze runners.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
He had keys.
There was no other choice.
Sorry?!
I'm sorry.
What's the difference?
Not you.  A copy.
But you were with me.
I know.
I wasn't with you.
Way you kiss me.
What?
Yes.
And it meant something.
You weren't real.
Realize?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
For what?
It was a test.
Why?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Yes.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Her?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Corporation can.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
Night City.
-- The inside?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Who are you?!
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
What are you talking about?
-- You told me.
Then how do you know about --
No.
You went to my high-school?
-- Katie.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
No.
Someone you have to get back to?
Tanner.
I've got to get back.
Some things never change, do they?
Cleaning up a mess.
What brings you inside?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Just like that --
Just like that?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
There?
It was just there.
Try me.
Because you'll never believe me.
Why not?
This.  No point to it.
What's so funny?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Don't know what you're talking about.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.

IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
He's on us!!
Speed?
We've got him locked!
Zordon...  he's gone.
What?!
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
How can we reach Phaedos?
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Stylin'!
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Now tell me... what do you see?
Wow.  Sand.
It will not harm you.
Yeah, right.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Ah... sure.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
So how can we get to it?
They're called squirbs.
Is this... food!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
Release the power with the power.
There should be a way to open it.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
I've never been this sore in my life.
I can hardly walk...
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
... What's happening to him?'
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
I heard that!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
What does that mean?!
Release the power WITH the power.
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
That's pretty bad.
Activating Power Beam!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
WHITE TIGER!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
... Let's take a look over there.
Anybody see anything?
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
... I just pray we're not too late.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
... We must try to communicate with them.
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
About twenty seconds in your time.
What's a Triac?
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
I see... a fox
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Where did it originate?
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
All systems go!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
I think so.
You okay?
TRICERATOPS!
PTERODACTYL!
THERE'S THE COMET!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Ryan's Comet!!
Two thirty three a.m.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
NEW POWER COINS!!
Release the power with the power.
... Nothing.
We can take these guys!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
LET'S FLY!
I'm in!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Let's go after him!!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
... Not bad.
BULK!!
SKULL!!
A real shame.
There goes the neighborhood.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There's enough for everybody!
Here you go!  No pushing!
A stellar idea, Skull.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
We could smell it's breath.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
And how do we release the power?
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
... A falcon?
Look closer.
It's... an eagle?
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
And how do we do that?
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
GET OFF ME!
Wait for me!
I'm outta here.
Did I say anything?
Just shut your gap!
How about Major Moron?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Hey, boss!
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
GO IVAN!!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
What!
Quack like a'duck!
Simon says...
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
But boss, what about their parents?
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
You want me to place a few calls?
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
What is THAT!
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
How'd you know?
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
What do you mean "basically"?
"Basically".
So they've been destroyed?
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
That was a CHEAP shot!
GO POWER RANGERS!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
NINJA APE ZORD!
LET'S DO IT!?
THREE SECONDS!!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
I am the mighty ape!
Strength in numbers!!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
What's going on?!
How the heck?!...
Activating Power Scope!
Anybody see them?
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
You own a hotel, sir?
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
And I ain't no nigger either!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
Awwh, Charlie.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
But I've never served a day.
We're asking you to go to prison.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
You've got the public upset, Al.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
But ya got a Boss.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
But not you.
Poor, yeah.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Tell me about it.
The goddamned bastards.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Charlie Luciano.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Not another word.
Boo-Boo.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
You scare me, Charlie.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Up here, Boss.
Scared.
What do you mean?
I guess I am. Just a little.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
No. Not everything.
And now you have everything.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Life knocked me back.
So what happened?
I had everything. Once.
Why should I be?
Are you frightened?
Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
I got my partner in there!
Could we step outside?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
When my money moves, I go with it.
If we have to.
We could lose the deal!
He's got a line on the good stuff.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
What's that divided four ways?
Four-twenty-eight.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
He was around...
Shane was a friend of yours?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Who hired the bastard?
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Bastard didn't even show.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
The deal's too good, Frankie
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
That ain't what your mama said.
You ain't even a man yet.
Long as Charlie says.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
That's it.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Well...
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
But there's...
I'm doin' business here!
Charlie?
It always is.
Would it be painful for you?
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
If I look weak now, it's over.
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
London?
I booked passage to London.
Gives us something in common.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
You could have stopped him.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Have you thought about this?
It's too late.
You got something to hide?
It's a mask.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
You're sure?
Same here.
I needed to see you again.
Something came up.
I was calling yesterday.
Luciano.
For what?
I'm already late.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
I must be going.
What's the matter?
No. I'm here with you.
You here with Bobby?
For being a man.
For being a bootlegger?
No. They envy you.
I can just imagine.
Inside, they were talking of you.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Who'll make the rules?
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
Charlie!
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
What's your problem?
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Tommy Reina.
Who?
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
I NEED THE TWENTY!
It'll just be a few minutes.
You bastards, I said twenty!
I told you twenty!
You're getting' 10 cc's
I'll do fine.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Might as well put the time to use.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
How soon can we pull this off?
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
I'll handle the Boss.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Like Don Maranzano.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Like a party for all our friends.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
I been thinkin'...
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
No. We ain't even...
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Meyer.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
We'll figure out something.
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
So what is the problem?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Meyer just finished the books.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
You fellas got names?
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
They don't give a shit about us!
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Ben-jamin.
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Not stupid. Fat.
The kid just called me stupid.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
But that's an hour's drive.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Not if they all die at once.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
They're friends of our enemy.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
What are ya thinkin'?
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
So tell me when I ain't done it.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
And I got it all planned.
You gotta plan these things.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
Didn't know you felt that way.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
I know about you.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Where we headed?
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
What the fuck does that mean?
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He's trying to make it.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
This business is about taking risks.
Never threaten me, Boss.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
See if these two are my friends.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
You boys carryin' pieces?
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
I'm glad ya come.
Ya piss like a man.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
I like that.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Forget it. That's past.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
You disrespect our tradition.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
The terms will be mine.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
We must be friends, Charlie.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
They do what I tell 'em.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
I don't fuck my partners.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
I'll take care of the Boss.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
That's why I'm here.
We learn from life.
I found that out.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
And the Jews?
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
I got partners.
You get fifteen percent.
What about the share.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
He's an animal!
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
I've got friends.
And how many soldiers do you have?
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The name's Charlie.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Don, I'd be honored.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Not a lot ta know.
I must know more of you, my son.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
And what do you want out of this?
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
So change it.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
The Big Picture.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Strategy.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
Okay. I'm listening.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
We can operate around these guys.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
We were overdue to get hit.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Masseria's been after me too.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
I turned him down flat.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Maranzano wants you dead.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
You wouldn't live out the week.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Fuck 'em.
Forget it.
Hell. It's been four days!
Jesus.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Come on. Be polite.
Where's the stiff?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Spare us.
Wanna know what I think?
Shuddup.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Now that's a hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Anything!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Kill them! Kill them!
What a cozy little scene.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Luciano is dead?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Yes?
This is nice. I mean it.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
You're fuckin' crazy.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Take any one ya like.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Best we got.
That a Jew compliment?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Just wanted ta say hello.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Five CC's.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Monkeybone?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
What?
Switch hands.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Yeah...before your time.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Who did this?
I don't know. I guess it was...
Special occasion?
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I didn't say anything.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Sad commentary, huh?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Stu Miley.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Olive or eyeball?
Uhh - martini?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Thank me next time you see me.
Death! Thank you!
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Back? You're sending me back?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
DEATH!!
Bend over?
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Well - you'd need a body.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<u>Why</u>??
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
At the moment, yes.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
You're really gonna pop the question?
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
How much?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Less.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
What's the matter?
A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
...In some weird way I respect that.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Why?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Holy shit.
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Monkeybone...!?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Tell me what?
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Uh huh. And?
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
He called me "Doc."
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
I need a new PR guy.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Got a doctor on duty.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Ohhh, nothing.
What are you watching?
<i></i> In what way?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Sure. Why?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Bitchin' good cake.
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
What's the matter?
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
How was it? I don't recall.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Stu?
I'd better go report this...
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Are you okay??
I don't think so.
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I might wake up.
What's the "bad" part?
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Who?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Can't you give it to me later?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Give me a date, Doctor.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
The ring...
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
When'd you get in?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Don't ask where I got it.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Hypnos?
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Isn't that Lulu?
What?
Stu...LOOK!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...Stu...
I don't <u>know</u>.
Where'd he go??
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
All right. You can come.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
<u>What</u> union?
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
You want to come inside?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Is there something else I can do for you?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Who told you we deal drugs?
And you don't deal drugs?
We like to think so, yeah.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Have a nice day.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Mm hmm.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
I can make my own decisions.
Mother!
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I'd love to.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Mm hmm.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Aaron?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
What's wrong?
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Mother, I ...
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
You know, you never tell me anything.
I don't want to talk about it.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
But I was dusting.
Behind the books.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Mother!
You know ...  ... whoops!
What pictures?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Dating anyone?
I'm good.
How are you doing sweetheart?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
... What are they all doing there?
Uh-huh?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
You don't like where I live?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
So, what do you think?
... Manly?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
He's an organic farmer.
What does he do?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
What happened?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Really?
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Who is it?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Forty-five all total.
I see.  How much?
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
This way?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
You mean it's dangerous?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Moscow.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Yeah.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
... Oh ...
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
So, you come here all by yourself?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
And where is she?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Where to?
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Thanks very much, sonny--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
It couldn't be.
But it *isn't*?
Looks like it, but--
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Never.
You've never *seen* this contract.
I did not--
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
It was?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Blow a bugle!
Let's send out a pigeon!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Positively not in the station! Gone!
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
What!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Diz!
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
He's a house-afire!
The war's on!
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Why me?
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Take me home, Diz.
You know, we're getting married.
Huh?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Right now--everything I own--!
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
You said it!
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Susan? Nah!
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
No--not offhand--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Okay--I mean--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
My first name's--Clarissa.
What?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
What?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
We're gonna get married.
Where?
Well, let's get going.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Do we *have* to?
No.
Have *you*?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Is the wind tired out there?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Tunnel?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
I'll cherish ya.
Okay. You don't mind?
Tonight?
Any time.
Good idea. When?
How about getting married?
Yeah.
Diz--
Again? Good idea.
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
I apologize.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Shut up, Diz.
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Waiter!
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
My friends?
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Yeah.
Yeah. Funny--
Drunks are funny--
"There's more light here," he says--
Why do I always laugh at that?
And to Don Quixote!
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Oh--yeah--
Paine.
What dame?
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
That's taking place outside now.
Yeah. What about the second act?
Did you like the first act?
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
You play--left field.
What do I play?
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Who?
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
You know--little worms--ambition.
What! Who?
You got worms.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Huh?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
What's this, Diz?
Would you settle for a husband?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Tell me why!
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
No!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
No wonder--without your dinner.
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Otis!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Nonsense.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
We're waiting, Hubert.
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Dinner, Hubert.
Now, pet--  Jim!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Taylor, my dear.
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Great saints!
Sam Foley--dead!
What is it?
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
What is it?
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
That infernal phone!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Oh! Go away.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
All right, why?
How do you feel, champ?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Are you ready for him, Bill?
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Oh--oh.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
He's batty!
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! 
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
Y-yes, Jim.
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Me! Jim--how--?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Oh--Jim!
*But you never asked me*!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
What!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
*You won't?*
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Henry Hill.
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
Horace Mill--!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
One minute! Just one minute!
Yes, Jim.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
The--head?
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
Ma! Hold him!
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Aw--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Himself!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
I did. What about it?
Oh, a *boy*!
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Is *what* getting me down?
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Emma!
A dirty frame!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Jeff for Senator.
Than what?
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
What stuff?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Uh--could--could I help--?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
A pet shop?
Why, of course.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Certainly. Step right in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Yes. Come in.
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
I beg your pardon?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
What? Who?
Look! There it is!
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Washington!
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
I yield.
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
For one week!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
For a question!
Will the Senator yield?
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Where were you?
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
No, Jeff--please--!
Please, sir!--come with me!
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Mr. President--
Mr. President--
Mr. President! A point of order!
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Will the Senator--
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
I have no defense against forged papers and--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President--
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
It does!
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
For a *question*.
Will he *yield*?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he yield for a question?
Yield *how*, sir?
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Y-yes.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Well--goodnight.
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
Here--where are you running off to?
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Nonsense, Jeff.
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Yes, I was--
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
No.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Thank you, sir.
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
We'd better see.
Just fine.
How's Amos, Ma?
Certainly would, Joseph.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Fine--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Hello, Jefferson.
What?
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir--
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Yes, Ma?
Jefferson--
Oh, now--
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
You're a liar!
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Can't you?
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Where do we go from here?
Hurray!
Yay!
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Oh--Saunders--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
But--I've done everything I--
What you *have* to do is fight!
Wait--
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
What are you going to do?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
I'm not.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
Saunders--
Hello.
Are you drunk?
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Saunders--!
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Wow!
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
Don't mention it--
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Oh--*Saunders*!
Thanks a lot.
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Do you want to dictate them?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Not another bill?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Second drawer.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Already? All these letters?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Must have been tickled pink.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Great.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
No--
You--don't know it, do you?
In Terry Canyon?
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
You win. It's--Clarissa.
I've got more. You better tell me.
No! Stop it!
Lena.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Abigail.
It *is* not!
I know. It's--Violet.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I also answer to whistles.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Why?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Terrible, thank you.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Go right ahead.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Have I?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
No complaints.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Since sixteen or so.
Have you always had to--work?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
You mean--here?
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
No.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Yes, yes--
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
He did?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
On paper?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
I did--and--and I got right up.
Try sitting down.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
And a *lot* of paper!
Thanks very much.
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Pardon?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
We're over in the House.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
*This* is.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
The Steering Committee.
What?
What's that?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Calendar?
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Some committee's got it.
Good. Where are we?
Yes, I see that.
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Why?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Why?
Committee.
Committee, huh?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
How?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Tonight.
A *day*!
Oh, just a day--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
And with your help--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Right.
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Punch?
Go ahead--punch.
I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
You *couldn't*?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
No. What had you better--?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Convene?
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Whose statue is that?
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Well--he's got nothing on me.
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Most natural thing in the world!
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
There *what* was?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Did you say--bus?
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Is--is something the matter?
J-Jefferson Smith.
What's your name?
No!
The man downstairs said number--
*No*!
Office of--Senator Smith?
What is it?
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
That's what I said--the *truth*!
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
A camp! Well!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Ah! That's more like it! What?
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
Well--I--
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Well! You don't say!
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
And how's your bill, Senator?
That's--that's splendid.
I'm splendid, too.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Splendid.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Goodnight, Senator--
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Then you *did* say it.
Oh--you are!
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
How are the pigeons?
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Sure.
Wonderful!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Ring the call to quorum.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Order, gentlemen!
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Yes, sir--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
"So help me God."
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
How's that, buddy?
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Well--I can *manage*--
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Well--I have got *one* idea--
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Ax?
Swell!
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
A Bill! Not *him*!
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What do you mean? What's going on?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
What! Who?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Susan!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
I know that.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
That's dynamite, Joe!
Let's get away from here. 
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Joe! You *told* him to!
What's the matter?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Chick--
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Okay. See you here.
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Well, well!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Go away, Nosey.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
He did it.
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Do you?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Well--me, too!
He's lost complete faith in me--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Yes--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
What do you want, Senator?
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What do you mean?
Yeah?  And what else?
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
No?
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Nice *compliment*!
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Oh, now--that won't do--
That's right.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
No?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
You want to see me, Senator?
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Maybe he won't get up.
Anything *better* to offer?
It's crucifying him--!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
You can't say *that* to--
Just a minute, Joe!
Jim!
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim, you don't have to--
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
You won't stand for it?
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
What do you think?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
That's him. Let him in.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Father--oh.
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
His first 'whiff'!
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
How nice.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Page boys!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Order!
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Order!
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will the Senator yield?
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Senator Paine.
Mr. President...
Certainly.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Some people like it.
That's going to be fun.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Who are you?
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Who's that?
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Yes, I
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes.
Deeds?
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Good morning.
He sure is.
He's still pixilated.
Yes, indeedy.
Oh, yes.
Uh-huh.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Always.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Yes, you own it.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
He sure is pixilated.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
And sings.
Sometimes he whistles.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Uh-huh.
Pixilated.
Oh yes, pixilated.
They think he's pixilated.
Sometimes twice.
Most every day.
He was a seven-months baby.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Since he was born.
Next, please.
Thank you very much.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
No, no children.
Any children?
Yes, sir.
Are you married?
Would you like to go for a walk?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Why not?
I haven't.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
No.
No. Are you?
Yes!!!
You are , aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Oh, thank you!
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Yes, but I
And you saw them happen?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
But they did take place?
NO!!
Are they true!
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
No! I resigned last week!
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
No!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Your Honor!
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Oh, hello darling.
Hello, Mary?
Yes, of course.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Mary - I - excuse me
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Well, here we are again.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
A girl?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
No, I don't mind.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
I don't blame you.
In a day or so, I think.
Are you? When?
Mary, I'm going home.
All right.
Let's just walk, okay?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Thank you.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Ready?
I'll get my hat.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
You threw them out!
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
I'd like to read it some time.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
It had better be good.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure!
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
He did?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
What did he play?
Yeah, I know.
He did? I play the tuba
He played in the town band, too.
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
You have?
I've often thought about going back.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Really?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
Oh, I don't know.
Nothing
What did you mean by that?
Oh, that
You said I was a lady in distress.
What's that?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Here's a nice place.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Why don't you try?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
There's Times Square.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
Now, what do you see?
That depends on what they see.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Huh?
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
It's wonderful.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Yeah, let's.
Yes.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
Uh-huh.
Have you seen the papers?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
What are they going to do?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Sure. I met you.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
I enjoy it.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Oh, I don't mind.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Really?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Oh - uh - nothing.
What?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Tell me more about yourself.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Feel better now?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
What happened?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
You fainted.
Hello.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
We're not going out tonight.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
You're acting like a school girl.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Running away is no solution.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
You're a fool, Babe.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Huh?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
The guy's balmy.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Yeah, then what?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Why? Why do we have to do it?
People have been crucified before.
I'm crucifying him.
Uh-huh.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Good night.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
Don't be ridiculous.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
No. It's nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Nothing.
What's the matter, hon?
Hello . . .
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
That's the rub.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
You're crazy! You can't do that!
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
What're you going to do?
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
Yes.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Last night he proposed to me.
What's bothering you, huh?
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Sure.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
When're you going to see him again?
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Had the boys follow us.
How'd you get the picture?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Is he really that big a sap?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Did it?
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Have lunch.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
With pay!
With pay!
Can I have a month's vacation?
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Look, I can do it!
Come on - let's go!
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Boy, was he burning.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Shhh!
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on!
Right.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, but you said
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
John
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
I wish you luck, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
How is this, sir?
Yes.
Me sir?
Sit over there, will you?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Stuff, sir?
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Oh, yes sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
How's it going? Okay?
Me, sir?
You try it.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Yes, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Yes, sir.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Let me go!
We'll send for the police!
I wanna see that guy!
He's not home, I tell you!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
You can't come up here!
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Nuisance value?
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Relatives of old man Semple.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Come on, John. What happened?
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Better wire him right away, John.
Thank heaven.
Mr. Cedar!
But your honor
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
Mr. Cedar!
It's a lie!
Proceed.
Your Honor, I object.
What was that you said he was?
He's what?
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Must we have the echo?
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
This is outrageous!
Miss Bennett please!
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
That tuba player!
What?
Look!
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
You can't?
I can't find him.
See you later, kid.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
That's pretty.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Hang up.
Wants to know who the heir is.
Newspaperman?
Okay.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Yeah?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
All set.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Where?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Yes?
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Why not? Who is he?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Huh?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Yes. That is to say
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
No?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
No, thank you.
Will you have a cigar?
When?
You're going to New York with us.
What for?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Who - me? No.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Buffer?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Why, no.
Are your parents living?
Yes.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
All right.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
How do you do.
How do you do.
Yes.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
No, thanks.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
What about your knocking off for lunch?
They can have the Estate.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Shut up!
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Sometimes it's the only solution.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Are those stories true?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Arthur wants to quit!
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Oh.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
What're you talking about?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Entertainment?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Only common sense.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
That's funny. Why is that?
Uh-huh.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
No, thanks.
Have a drink?
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Huh?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
I've got one for Cobb
Nah.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Why should you?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Why not?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Now, where were we?
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Naturally.
Me?!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
We provide opera.
We own an opera house, don't we?
Why, it's an artistic institution
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
I'm Chairman.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
I'm Chairman?
It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Ja.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Uh-huh.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
Oh, Mr. Deeds
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Let him alone.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Now wait a minute, buddy
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Oh. That.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Huh?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
No, I mean - about my client.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Yes, sir.
A child? My uncle's?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Mrs. Semple?
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Look, he's temperamental.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
No.
Well, I play the tuba.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I don't know. I
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Proceed.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Not at all.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
A what?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Proceed.
Take the stand!
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Yes?
Your Honor
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Brookfield just came in.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Uh-huh.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
That ought to be fun.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Binge?
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Now you keep out of this!
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Don't pay any attention to her.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
I don't know.
Who are they?
Oh. Oh!
South Dakota - but on the top.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota north.
Where is your farm?
Yes, ma'am.
Farmer?
Christian Svenson.
What is your name?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
You mean  by the neck or something?
Is Mary home?
Yeah. What?
Is she home?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
No!  What do you want!!
Shall I call the police, sir?
Yes, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Yeah.
Me, sir?
You try it.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
What, sir?
Hey, did you hear that?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
But she's on the telephone
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Who?
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Looking for?
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Please!
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
What two policemen?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
I did what!
You came home last night - without them.
You have no pants, sir.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Oh, I do too, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Prairie? Oysters?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
What's that?
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
Yes, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Every man to his taste, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Excuse me. What did you say?
No, sir.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Yes, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
What do you think you're doing?
Yes, sir.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Tails tonight, sir?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
You can go out there if you like...
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
Take your time.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Doubtful. What did he say?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
You must have been concerned.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
What happened?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
One hundred books?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Uh-huh. What are they?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
Really? You think so?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Hmm?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Good kids.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
How did they threaten you?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Me more than most.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
A friend?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
Were you supposed to have a session?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Why's that?
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
What's that?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Uh-huh.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Could you come with me please?
Mr. Cook.
Dr. Mumford.
Not any more.
But you do therapy?
No, not really.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
I'm fine.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
...And I from Phyllis.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
Thank you.
I think he's got a point.
Ernest, what do you think?
What an asshole!
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
What's that?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
I see.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
What kind of doubts?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
How do you mean?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
My approach?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Are we?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Right now?
What are you doing for lunch?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I feel like we're making real progress here.
My pleasure.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
And the experiment is in here?
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
But you did come to me.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
What exactly is it supposed to do?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Should I open it now?
It's a thought I had.
What is it?
You are so mean.
What's that?
Now we're back on track.
I was... never satisfied.
What?!
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
I didn't hear you.
Go to hell.
Where's your wife, Henry?
I never said that.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
No?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Why? I'm paying for this.
Stop now.
What?
Henry!
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Mr. Follett.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Good, then go.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Why not?
I don't want to hear any more today.
I have eighteen more minutes!
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
What brought this on?
Mr. Gilroy --
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Do you want to come in?
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
She seems very unhappy.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
What do you think's wrong with her?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Tastes good.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
A little.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
You've done well.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Althea hasn't told you?
What do you do?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I've had my moments.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Nope.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
What?
I'm sorry, your honor.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Yes.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Yes, your honor.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
I do.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Well, come on in.
Yeah.
You do?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
What are they?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
That's a lot of people all at once.
I'd better get in there.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
What?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Oh?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
What it might take is... doing time.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Okay.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
He told you.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Doc.
Lily.
Doc...
...so accomplished.
...so rich?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
You're on your own today, honey.
Where am I supposed to eat?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Why do you watch?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
...And?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
And the Brocketts?
It's a pretty piece of land.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Doc.  Ainge...
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
You like me. How come?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Oh, I don't know...
How long you been in this town?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
What do you want to know?
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
It was Henry Follett.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Who was that?
My patient had to leave early.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
You're right, as usual. See you.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Hello, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Sure I can, Lionel.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
-- Go on!
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
How are you?
Did you straighten her out?
Martin.
Hiya, Doc.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
Is she a friend of yours?
What's wrong with her?
Got to.
I'm trying.
Can you help Mom?
That would explain it.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
You're good.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Don't need it.
Got a license?  But no car?
Sure.
But you know how to drive?
Mother... go away!
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What kind of doctor are you?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Do you think that's a good idea?
We're going for a walk.
What's happening here?
Mumford... like the town?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Well, look who's here...
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Wow. You're something.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Well... you see, the problem is --
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Why don't you tell me?
I think you do.
No, I really don't.
I think you know what I mean.
What do you mean?
Finally, some common sense...
What?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What'd you want?
That's right, the fake kind.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
Will you be here?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you wait for me?
You got off easy.
What is your name?
Anything... just ask.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
Oh.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Will you think about it?
What?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But...
I am irate!
You deserve it.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You feel violated?
You're not the only one...
...How violated I feel?
You probably got the idea.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Sofie...
Which show was that?
I guess you saw the show...?
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Mother...
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Hello.
Hello?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Transference.
Transference!
What was that?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
I think so.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Okay...
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
I don't follow you.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I'm glad.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Um-huh.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Is it something you've heard about me?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
You're upset.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Of course.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
Of course.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I don't know if --
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
That's... good?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yeah?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
That's one way to put it.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Either one.
Which thing?
That's what I like.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
It's all right.
You like it?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
And he's where?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
So whose route is this?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
Is that when you split up?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Disgusting.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Yes.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
You're doing great.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Is that like a party trick?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Life.
Where?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Uh-huh.
Sore throat?
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Be specific.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Sorry... I'm done.
Is this the treatment?
Really? What would it take?
No.
I've offended you!
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
What?
Please... forgive me.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Something's bothering her.
We don't discuss it.
Is she against you getting help?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Mom's such a cutie.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
I'm not making any promises.
Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
Maybe you'll catch it.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
We'll work it out.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
What would you do?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
Even if you don't think it's real?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Hmm.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
No.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
What?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
When did you start to feel this way?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
What can you tell me about this?
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
He agreed?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Really?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
No again?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
What did he want you to do?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
What'd he say?
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
Do you think that's what he wants?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
Uh-huh.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
True. Should we stop them?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Was it something that happened at school?
What are you talking about?
What happened today?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
What do you want me to see?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
That's not quite what I said --
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Have women found you attractive?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Where was this?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
It's my bit for the community.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's called pro bono.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
It's a big part of the show.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Weekly or monthly?
In maybe three or four issues.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Yep.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
What?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Yes, yes it does...
I guess that makes sense.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I'm here for you, Doc.
Wow.
Sorry...
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Lily.
What'd I do?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Really?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
You're completely reliable.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I'm honored.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
See you Thursday... regular time.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
English Lit.
Psych major?
No... no training.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
And a birth certificate is enough?
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
What about it?
All new people start with that...
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
That'd be Lily.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
And the drugs?
You and Candy...?
Things got a lot worse.
At least you pulled yourself out...
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
But look at me now...
You were messed up, man.
"Get to know your therapist."
Holy shit!
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Did you carry a gun?
It wasn't the best situation.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Sounds like you have several.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
What about everything? How did this happen?
I can tell you anything else.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
It matters to me.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Damn! What is your name?
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
Just you.
Who else knows?
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
It's not?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Definitely.
Really?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
You don't think I'm insane?
How's it coming?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
A doll?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Slash what?
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Jerking off?
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Okay... let's say that, for now.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
It's just a thought.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Yep.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Hey, Skip.
I wondered what happened to her...
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Uh-huh.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
This --
What?
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Amazing.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Well, there's Lily.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Don't you like this?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
This is exactly what I wanted.
This is great!
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
I've got three big ones.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I understand.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Is that the question?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Nah... scotch.
Would you like another beer?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
How are you?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Yes... your particular approach.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
That was a terrible thing.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
When?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
Well, okay then.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
I never killed a priest before.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Who the hell are these guys?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
You know where he's taking her?
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Relax, I got him.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Excuse me?
And then killing your sister.
Oh yes, of course.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
And how does one do that?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And what ritual would that be?
You're not going to kill us?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
What does he want the book for?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
You shall see.
Immune from what?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
What friend? You're my only friend.
Where's your new friend?
Do you know where I can steal some?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Why do you like to fight so much?
C'mon, friend.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Goin' somewhere?
I've had worse.
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Sounds familiar.
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Even?
Let's make us even, shall we?
You always did have more balls than brains.
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
None of the above, thank you.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Altar boys?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
In the desert? What for?
Now go find me a big stick.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Yeah! Them.
Intestines.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Oh yes, always.
Yeah?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
What just happened?
That's one way of putting it.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Exactly --
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
What is he doing here?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
Perhaps.
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Correct, And that's when --
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
Try me.
You will not believe it.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
What did you do to him!?
You bastards!
Water turning to blood.
The sun turning black.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
What are you doing here?
A bright good morning to all.
Forty.
Twenty.
Fifty percent.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
I would never!
You lie.
Three hundred pounds!
Proceed!
Two hundred pounds.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
I am an English woman.
No women allowed.
To be hanged.
Where are they taking him?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
And what did he say?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
And what is he in prison for?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Got guts, lady.
I have no choice.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got what?
Got it!
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
I think you were jealous
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
You called me your girl?
The creature!? Are you sure!?
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
FINE.
I'm staying.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
It's everybody's problem!
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
No, we are not.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
That bad huh?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Very slowly.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Is he supposed to look like that?
You dream about dead guys?
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No... Why?... Should I?
Because that's my name.
Why would I do that?
Not unless you call me Rick.
I'm not?
No you're not.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
And what is that?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Something like that.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
You two!
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
How?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
Who was talking about what?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
For entering the afterlife.
Preparation for what?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
What are those mirrors for?
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
The things that get you excited.
That "thing" gets me excited.
We're about to be shown the way.
For what?
Are you sure?
We're almost there.
Trust me.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Can you swim?
Oh that's comforting.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
I know my treasure.
You know your history.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
If you call that a kiss.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Really want to know?
Yes.
Want to know?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
I found sand. I saw death.
What did you find? What did you see?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
No, I mean --
Every damn day.
You swear?
Yeah, I was there.
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
I just decked your brother
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
No?
No.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Broad?!
So who's the broad?
Yes,... I see.
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
What's it look like!?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Oh.
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Read the inscription on the cover!
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Shut-up and get me off of here!
I found it, Evy! I found it
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Juicy?
Well neither do I, thank you.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Did you ever see him eat?
What do you suppose killed him?
Still...
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Do you really think he'll show up?
Way to go, Evy.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Picked his pocket, actually.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
That just makes you more gullible.
I'm your sister.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
You lied to me!
I was mistaken.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
I think you found something.
Yes?
Jonathan?
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
You...! YOU...!
You have got to be joking?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Got it.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
We gotta get her back.
What?
What?
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
That looked rather painful.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Who's here!?
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
You did not!?... We're not!?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Where's my gun?
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Tough break.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
None taken.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Awfully.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Um, well, you see...
Hey,... don't I know you?
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
She's my sister, actually.
What --?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
And what's that?
Except for one little thing.
Um-hmm.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
Really?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
Of course.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I know you knew I'd know.
I knew you'd know.
I know you did.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Do I?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Our guests are waiting.
One last tweak.
I thought you were done?
Fantasizing... about you.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Head hunting.
Where are you going?
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
Your mind is so slippery.
It must have slipped my mind.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Atta, boy!
Atta, girl!
Do it, big boy!
Come on, baby!
And some sandwiches --
We could really use some coffee --
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Much less go outside.
I was eight.
When was that?
He was the last time I saw him.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
We didn't think this through very well.
The Disco Boys.
So who killed him?
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Really?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
I'm his daughter.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Or even what it looks like.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Let's do it.
Sounds good to me.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
No one will believe us.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Me, too.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
But in fact... you'd found it.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
But you're a superhero.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
I can't.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
The Inscrutable Six?
How about... the Savage Six?
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
He was cute though.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
I'm the Bowler.
Who are you?
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Eat your mustard.
Sure.
Hey... you okay?
Hello?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
I dunno.
What did he mean?
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
I thought you'd never ask.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Think positive.
He'll never make it.
Get on to yourself!
Snap out of it!
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
He's dead.
How's your dad?
Thanks.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
That boy's got talent.
Why bother?
Should I kill them?
Superheroes.
What about Captain Amazing?
I got it.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Have you considered my offer?
Ummm.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Frankenstein!
And the light goes out...
So are you!
You're dead.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Against.
Are you with me... or against me?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
They always call the great ones nuts.
You're nuts.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Captain who?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Stay away!
Roy.
Who?
I saw him walk you home.
What?
You're a spy.
I'd better go.
Remember the cat.
Curiosity.
Then why are you here?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Come here.
Me.
Who's the artist?
Why not?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Hi.
Terrific.
Sure -- I guess.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Really?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
You underestimate yourself.
Just a waitress.
Are you an actress?
Really?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Monica!
Bye. 
What?
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
And what if you get killed?
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
What are you talking about?
I'm going inside.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
At the Frankenstein Center.
Monica, where are you?
It's me.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
I just want to be a superhero.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Me, too.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
What have they got that we ain't got?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Yeah.
It's home.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Have you always lived here?
Roy.
What's your real name?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Who wouldn't?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
It is?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Why?
I admire you.
That was easy. 
Sure.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Yeah.
Date?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Every night.
Alone tonight?
Hi.
Not tonight. 
Or talk?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Good or evil, what's the difference?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
I just know.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Yes.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Yes.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Now you're talking.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
It is not dead. It is hiding.
My heart died a long time ago.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
When I am sure I am among friends.
When are you going to take off that mask?
You drink too much.
And a skunk stinks!
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
And you are a fool.
You're the Sphinx.
With what?
Cover me!
Not a chance!
I'll drive.
Are you coming or not?
But she still might call!
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
But I just don't feel it.
GET MAD!
Because that's what it is.
This place is built like a fortress.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
So what else has Superman got?
SO WHAT?
But there's still only six of us.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
There's a big difference.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
There's just not enough of us.
Yeah.
You sure that's how you spell it?
Good point.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Have you ever seen him?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
I'm liking this.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
And it would be the right thing to do.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
What are you talking about?
So when are we gonna have an on night?
We had an off night, that's all.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
LOOK!
Oh don't start that again --
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Come on.
What's that?
He hasn't stolen it yet.
So where's the art?
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Roy --
Oh shut up.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Maybe there was traffic.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Sounds good.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Agents?
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Maybe she's right.
Shhh.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Well they've crawled back out.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
The who?
Wait!... Look!
Let's go.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
See ya tomorrow.
Or flowers.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Who's chicken? 
So you're chicken?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Nah.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Why not?
I can't.
So why don't you just tell her!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
But look at him... and look at us.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
There's a vague similarity.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Hey... he's gone.
Yes, Obie-wan.
Anybody got any?
Firepower costs money.
The Eradicators!
The Obliterators!
Yes.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
No.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes.
But... only when no one is looking.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Ow.
Here you go. 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
So what can I get you?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Really?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Wow.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Not yet.
Are you famous?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
We're superheroes.
You guys going to a costume party?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
You did?
I always knew that you were special.
It is?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
I use it... to fight evil.
But... the silverware?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Mother... it's not what you think!
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
It's on the television.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Oh hi, Mom.
Jeffrey!
Right.
Through there!
Where am I going?
May the forks be with us!
We've got lift off!
With or without him, we gotta go!
It's time.
Great timing!
Oh no.
It's suicide.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
That was too close.
But how do we get in?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
The bazookas?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Are you sure he's still alive?
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Whatever our name is.
To us!
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
And a social life.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
The who?
And there's the Sphinx.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Do we have to?
Shut up.
Be a Mohican.
Be a Mohican. 
Sorry.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Or both.
Or Batman --
This looks like a job for Superman --
We may be getting in over our heads here.
The Disco Boys.
Who are they?
This is bad.
Ask her out.
Definitely.
She likes you.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Hi.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Proceed.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Proceed.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
What do you mean?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I'm glad you like it.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Ah -- you approve?
And, what a delightful idea!
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
You realize what is at stake?
I'm not insulted.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
Fair enough.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Properly arranged, yes.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Where are they?
There are none here.
Any cannon?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Cavalry?
About 5,000 troops.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
Are you serious?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
What do you have in mind?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
No, thank you.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
May I come to the map?
Please...
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I did, sir.
Yes -- who spoke up?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
And where is Joseph?
I don't know, sire.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
But who made this treaty?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
And who is defending Paris?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And where is the army?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
No, sire... I was asleep.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Yes, sire?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Bertrand, sire.
Who is there?
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
That is incredible.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
It is a terrible shock.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Let me see it.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Come in.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Come back in an hour.
General Bonaparte?
Oh, shit, that's not right.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Read it back.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Thank you, sir.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
No, sir, none at all.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Yes, sir.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Yes, sir, I am.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
I see...
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah-hh, no.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
No, they're living in Nice now.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
I haven't been there for three years.
Have you been back recently?
Ajaccio.
Bastia -- and you?
Oh -- where do you come from?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Yes, I am.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
A glass of champagne, please.
Yes, sir?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
When you eat him, may I have some?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Why are you carrying the dog?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Hello there, Picart.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
It is the work of incendiaries.
How did it spread so quickly?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Why didn't you wake me then?
The first reports came in at about ten.
When did it start?
My God, what a fire!
Four o'clock.
My God...!  What time is it?
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
What is that?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Oh?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
No, sir.
Does your mother know you have come?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
And he sent you to me?
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
That is correct.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
No -- not as a rule.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Thank you, Napoleon.
I'll have the fire built up.
Thank you.
Would you like some brandy?
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
I see.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Oh...?
I very much doubt that he will.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Yes -- an excellent idea.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Oh, yes... of course.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Lisette La Croix.
Only Lisette?
Lisette.
What's your name?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Yes, I am, sir.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Yes, it must be.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Good evening, sir.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Will you use the troops?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
When is she supposed to return?
Well, you shall see.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Are you trying to insult me?
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
You must not act impetuously.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
I know of no better time.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
And you, Junot?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
No... nothing at all.
Junot?
No...
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Ah, that is good.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
It's me.
Who is it?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
But you will not... be safe...
Yes.
Separate bedrooms?
Goodbye.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
What are you doing in there?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
I know what you're doing in there.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Open the door.  It's me.
Yes -- what is it?
You are my old friend.
All right -- I promise.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Promises mean nothing.
Promise.
I don't understand you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
I will never forgive you.
Promise me.
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me you will never leave me.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
She must have been in love with you.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Were any of them married?
One had better legs.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Yes.
Were they pretty?
No.
Were you in love with any of them?
Of course.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
No.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Yes.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
And now?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Were you in love with him?
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
May I offer you a drink?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
Can you give me a drink, please?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Yes.
You mean you heard them making love?
Yes.
You could hear them?
Yes?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
How do you know?
I know.
How do you know?
God help me -- yes.
Do you know what you're saying?
My God, what do you think?
What was there to tell?
About Hippolyte Charles.
You couldn't face telling me what?
I couldn't face telling you.
You wrote it.
Yes, I wrote it.
What?
I wrote it.
Yes.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
That's all I can say.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What are you talking about?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Why not?
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Certainly.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Why did you give it to him?
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
There's probably some explanation.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
I believe you sent for me.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
No.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Of course, my dear.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Do you like music?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
Oh, then you are...
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
That is a matter of opinion.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
And where do you place Alexander?
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
What I am talking about is moderation.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
We have a treaty with Austria.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
That is correct.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Yes, he has.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Does she deserve anything better?
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Send him in.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Come in.
Let me have it.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Come in.
Send him in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Come in.
Show him in.
Yes, sir.
Is he alone?
Eugene de Beauharnais.
What did you say his name was?
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
And I can go free?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
That's it?
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Anything you need.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Don't move me.
Stretch it out.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Yup.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Suga!
I don't know!
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Why you say that?
I know you smoke weed, right?
Good.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Y'all never use it?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
You paid cash?
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Well, let me in.
Yeah.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Thanks, Unc.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Alright, I'll remember that.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Where you going?
Can I look for myself?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
Yes you did.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
I'm his cousin.
Who are you?
Cheeco.
Fuck, what's his name?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
What about the dog?
It's about to work, just come on.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Me neither.
Black magic.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
Naw, I already ate.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
What's the green stuff poking out?
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Not me.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
I'm gone.
You know what he mean, dude.
What you mean talk to her?
What happen?
Great moves, Day-Day.
I'll do it.
No I'm not.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Nobody!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I ain't trying to rob you...
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
What about me?
You're welcome, Unc.
No, man, just wait.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
What you see?
Wait for what?
Wait.
Me too.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
No.
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
You make it sound so easy.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
What's the B-G's?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Yeah, air.
I didn't see nothing.
You see that?
Sorry about today, man.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
I don't know yet.
What we gonna do?
Nothing.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Out the door and to the left.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Still gonna smell it.
It works.
That ain't gonna work.
Blow.
Ain't no windows in here.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
I don't.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
You better stop running from that girl.
You already in.
I ain't trying to get in it.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
What's the matter?
Okay, plan B.
$247.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
How can they do this?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
You know what this is?
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
You walked?
I walked.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
What you mean, so?
So.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Why?
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
That's the sister.
Who is that?
You don't know Baby D.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Damn, you got a stalker.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
What?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
I can't taste nothing.
Just a little.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
You straight?
I know, be still.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
Thanks for reminding me.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Man, this a cool house.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
This you?
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Who is that?
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
What's crackin'?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
You alright?
Okay.
Next time, page me first.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Make sure.
It's locked.
I did.  Is that door locked?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
You did all this for me?
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Better sooner than later.
Most definitely.
I just wanted to give you this.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Hello, remember me?
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
I don't know.
You want us to give you a ride?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Karla.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
What is it?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
I don't play for no team.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Can I help you?
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
I said hold on!
Delivery!
Hold on.
Delivery!
Nothing.
Smokin' what?
You too.
Yeah, pops!
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Come on.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
I saw it.
You see that?
Have you seen Day-Day?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
I'll remember.
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
You coming in?
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
It's alright.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Just hold your breath.
All damn.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
What it smell like?
I do.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
What's the matter?
Well bring yo' ass on...
Here I come!
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Peace out, Craig.
Nice to meet you?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
What kind of activity?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
Excuse me?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
I don't have no damn cover.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
Call me.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Thanks for the help.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
He's a boy, dude.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Bite his ear!
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
I don't know.
What?!  What that mean?
Ya'll live around here?
Hey.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
And some rolling papers.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
This is a knock.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Go for it.
You wanna knock?
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
Why did he go in the house?
He's inside the house?
Where's Craig?
Roach...Roach, come on.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Let it go!
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I know.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
You could sell your Beamer.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Roach, what are you doing?
Sorry, dude.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I do.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Today ain't my day.
Negative...they vamped.
Are they still out there?
You don't wanna know.
What was that?
You damn right that's the big one.
That the big one, huh?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
What is it?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
What it say?
What up, bro?
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I don't know.
Where's Craig?
Sorry, my ass.
I know.  I'm sorry.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What?!
I got fired too.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
20 minutes?
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Tape his mouth shut.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Nothing.
What the fuck you looking at?
I don't know.
Hey, how you get out of here.
Good, let's get out.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Huh?
Ezal!  Ezal!
I don't know.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I can't feel my legs no more.
What?
Debo!  Debo!
Keep pushing.
You too big.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
William.
I don't know the number.
Just do it.
That ain't gonna work.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
What urgent message?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Get on!
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Get on.
Yeah.
Rancho Cucamonga?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What you say?
I don't know, Debo.
Where did Craig move to?
Yeah, and hurry up.
'Take your car?'
Take your car.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Nothing.  What you want?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I'll take you later.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
What's the matter?
My back.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Shut yo' ass up.
Need to lose some weight.
I got my mase.
What about that ugly dog?
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
I threw my back, again.
Elroy, what happen?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Mr. Nasty time?
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
What you doing to my nephew?
Huh?
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Elroy.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Oooh, ba-by!
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
I've been a bad boy.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
That's my girl.
All right, I'll do it.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
What happened here?
Don't remind me.
Who, him? Just visiting.
What's he doing here?
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
It's an important speech.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Oh, yeah?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
The grave. Somebody close?
What?
Somebody close?
Aw, too bad.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Huh?
'S okay. What do you think?
Sorry.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
San Diego.
Where'd you come from?
Business.
Business or pleasure?
Uh, yes..
You just come in on Amtrack?
What?
Amtrack?
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Where to, sir?
Same to you.
Good luck.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Can we go now?
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
For not believing you.
For what?
I would also like to apologize.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Indeed.
This? I've never even fired one.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
What the hell are you saying?
And your husband works for somebody else.
What?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Who did?
No.
You shot her?
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
How do you know that?
It was because I had this...in my pocket
You were very nervous.
That's right.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
Ah.
I have a problem.
That's...a comfort to hear.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
I appreciate that.
My security people are right next door.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Yes?
I...
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I need your help.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
You know what I'm gonna do.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Don't you threaten me.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Forget about it.
I want'to talk to her.
No.
Let me talk to her again.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
That's right. That gives you...
One thirty. California Ballroom.
No, please...
Again.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Come back.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
How am I supposed to get away?
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
Keep your voice down.
I kill her - and you kill me.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
You fucked up.
I killed you.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You killed him.
Tell me why he's dead.
How should I...?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
He's dead?
Tell me why I miss him.
What...?
Me?
What would you do in my place?
Then I have time for a drink.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
You...
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
What about the gun?
The gun...
Are you 'fucking with me!?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
This says "invitation only".
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
I will do no such thing.
What's your point?
You're out of your mind.
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
Yes, I'm listening.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Good.
Yes, yes, I understand.
You wouldn't...
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Daddy?
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
I'd like to know what...
Come with us, sir.
Yes.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
What?
Could I see some identification, sir?
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
We have to hurry.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I think you're right.
I think you better put that away.
Okay...
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
But...
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Are you sure?
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I don't know.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
No, that's,..that's fine
Is that something precious?
No, kisses to...
No. Kisses to you.
No...kisses to you.
All right. Kisses to you.
I promise.
Will you promise me that?
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
All right.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
To be a hero?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
Can we go now?
I know you do, honey.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Over and out.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Lynn!
Right.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Let' s do it.
Nods.
Ready?
How did you see us kiss?
No way.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
On TV.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
We made it.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for the shine.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
What are you going to do!?
What are you going to do now?
I don't know.
Well?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
What am I supposed to say to her?
What!?
You're going to go see her.
Yeah.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Thank you.
Irene is going to help.
Hi.
Meet Irene.
Don't think I won't.
Keep the change.
What are you going to do?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
Yeah, all right, listen...
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Oh, Jesus ...
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Who?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Kill the Governor.
What are you supposed to do?
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
That's right.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
What?
Cover your mouth.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Please...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Oh, man...
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
I remember. The big tipper.
You remember me?
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
You got anything smaller?
Is within himself.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
I said I have to do something.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I have to do something.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
I'm just an accountant.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
Fuck you!
Gimme a dollar.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Hey!
I don't think so.
Fuckin' A.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
Could I see it?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
I see. Where is this gun?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
What?
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
A surprise?
I've got something for you.
Why?
Close your eyes.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
You're a big girl, huh?
I'm not a baby.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Where are we going?
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You have, huh?
I've done much better ones than this.
That's pretty good.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
It goes in that little hole.
Laughs.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
Everybody does?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
You stole that.
It's time. It's time now.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Get moving.
Shut up.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Help me get her off the rug.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
It better be.
It's under control.
It doesn't look like it.
Yeah.
You got this under control?
Just put her on.
What gives?
Put her on.
Yeah.
Come Back.
Do it!
Yeah.
'Daddy has to go now.
That's enough.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
You're wasting time.
Only you.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
I kill her anyway.
And what happens if I don't call you?
Come with me, honey.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Foreigners! Fuck!
Young love.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Right there.
Where?
I'm looking for them.
What about them?
Keep your eyes peeled.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
That one.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
What do you figure he done with it?
No.
He never told about the money.
He carried on some; kicked.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
No.
Any trouble?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
I'll bet.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
You, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Hm!
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
No, Ben.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
And I won't never tell about the money.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
I will guard Pearl with my life...
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Not even her?
You understand?
Yes, Dad.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Here they come.
Listen to me John.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Where's your Mom?
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Don't!
Uncle Birdie!
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
No.
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Leavin', boy?
Just fine.
How's your sister Pearl?
O, she's all right.
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
I been mindin' Pearl.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
She went.
Where's Ruby?
They hid in a broom closet!
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
I'll light the lamp.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
She went.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yes! Yes!
And the Lord told that man --
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Yes! Yes!
You have all sinned!
AAA-MENN!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Tricked us!
He lied!
Come on!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Twenty-five wives!
Bluebeard!
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
What can we do, Mother?
A man of the Cloth?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
All to pieces!
Is he hit pretty bad?
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Just went?
I'll be switched!...
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Who?
Sshhh! He's in there.
What's wrong, Mother?
Mother, I only --
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Walt!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
About what!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
How do you mean?
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
So you ain't with the State no more?
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
It's a shame!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Get along with you.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
You go set down by the River.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
The money, Icey.
What?
There's something else.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
Pearl dotes on him.
John don't like him much.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Fiddlesticks!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
The devil wins sometimes!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
I tried to save her.
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
What!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
How?
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
Amen.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Ah.
Satan.
What could have possessed that girl!
Mister Powell!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Amen! Amen!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Ssh...
Are we goin' home, John?
That's Daddy!
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Hush.
John, where are we g --
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John?
It'll spoil our supper.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
I'm hungry, John.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
Where are we goin', John?
No, that's just it. No.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Why?
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
To see Dad?
She's gone to Moundsville.
Where's Mom?
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
It's all here.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Pearl! You ain't --
You what?
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
John! Don't!
You swore, Pearl!
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Hm?
Now can I tell?
Sshhh...
John...
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
The Blue Men?
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
Tell me a story, John.
'Cause you're too little.
Why?
You better not sing that song.
Hing, hang, hung.
Blue men.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
You, Pearl. You swear too.
There! What's so hard about that!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
I'll make coffee.
I'll see to Pearl.
He ain't my Dad.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I mind you said there was two.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Up river.
Where ye from?
Dead. 
Dead.
John, where's your folks?
She talks to herself.
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Don't you hurt her!
Come to me, boy!
Nothin'. 
You could save him, little bird.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Under the stone in the floor.
Now: Where?
Yonder.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Why sure, boy, sure.
Don't you believe me?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
What?
All right...  Come along.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
All right boy: where's the money?
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
I'll tell.
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
I don't know nothin'!
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
Yes. Yes.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Come on, children!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
What's that you're playing with, boy?
It -- she --
What's taking you so long about it?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What are you doing, boy?
No. No.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Nothin'!
Tell me what, boy?
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Huh?
Did you hear what I said, son?
Is that all?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Because John said I mustn't.
Why, pray tell?
No.
About our secrets.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Can I have milk too?
Naturally.
Can I have my supper please?
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
I'm hungry.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
John's bad.
Where's the money hid.
All right.
O no! Your turn!
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Yes; John's bad.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
What's your name?
Sure, that's no secret.
That's no secret. I'm five.
How old are you?
What secret shall I tell?
Now it's your turn.
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes?
I'll tell you a secret.
Mm-hm.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Ahh!
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Pearl and John.
What's their names?
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
No. No one never did.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
O' course.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Can I have this?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
What do you figure to do?
She turned me out of the bed.
How's that?
Our honeymoon.
The first night?
Yes; from the first night.
Didn't you have no inkling?
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Mister Powell?
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Answer me!
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
I'm through, Harry.
Are you through praying?
Yes.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
I -- no, I --
Do you want more children, Willa?
Get up.
Harry, what --
Get up, Willa.
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
No, Harry! I thought --
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
I was praying.
Harry!
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
None of your business, Madam.
What are you after them for?
Them kids!
What do you want?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
What's wrong, John?
What's wrong, John?
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
The Lord will provide.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
She took them kids with her?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Where's she at?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's your Missus?
My flesh and blood!
Them kids is yours?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
How'do.
Mornin', ladies.
The man! The man!
What?
Miz Cooper!
John and Pearl!
Pearl and John.
What'd you all talk about?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Now who was this?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
I been out with men.
What you been up to?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
The Drugstore?
This man down at the Drugstore...
When did I ever?
You'll whip me!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
I been bad!
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
Pearl and John!
Get the kit!
Oh my god, oh my god...
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
How can you tell?
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Thank God.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
How long's this been going on?
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
I sure as hell hope so.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
No, nothing.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Meanwhile...?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You crazy? Hit him with what?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What!?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
How you plan to do that?
My dream.
Bring him out of what?
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
You do?
The killer.
Who?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Much better.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
Hi.
Hello?
Well what you reading it for?
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Great.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
What happens if they don't do that?
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
Yeah.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
No.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Used to. Not anymore.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Yeah. So?
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Okay?
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Uh-oh...
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
You believe in anything?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
No.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Slept like a rock.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Not really.
Haven't slept, have you?
Guess I did.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
You okay?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
What the hell's going on!?
Who was scary?
Because he was scary, that's why.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
It's just a stupid cat.
Jesus.
Worked like a charm.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Deal.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, but...
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Nan, I --
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
You know he's dead though, right?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Hello Nancy.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Dad -- what you doing here?
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
You don't know he did it.
He's dangerous.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Decide to take a day off after all?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
You used me, daddy!
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
What?
She dreamed this would happen...
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Rod's not a lunatic.
Okay. Hi, dad.
How you doing, pal?
'Anything funny' like what?
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
I don't mean her --
She lived there.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
What's the Coroner got to say?
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Like Rod Lane?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
How you know that?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Krueger?
Krueger.
Who? Who did that?
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
Feeling better?
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
Just sleep now, Mom.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Give me the key, mother.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Go on...
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
So he's alive?
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Dead and gone.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
S'curity.
What's with the bars?
Nancy!
Screw sleep!
Put that damned thing down!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Go even crazier?
Okay.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
You okay?
Nancy?
I must be going nuts...
Right.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
To bed with you, c'mon.
Great
You okay?
Warm milk. Gross.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Mother, for petesakes.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
What?
I will.
Get into bed.
I won't.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Right home after. See you.
Right home after.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Did you sleep?
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
School.
Where you think you're going?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
It wasn't that serious...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
No.
Do you think I did it?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
What you mean 'all at once'?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
No.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
And then what happened?
The door was locked from your side.
Someone else was there.
You were screaming like crazy.
I never touched her.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
We should get her out of here...
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
What you dream?
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Nice to have a fire.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Yeah, nuts.
He's nuts about you.
Rod says the sweetest things.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
When did you have a nightmare?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
No more fights.
No more fights?
Jungle man fix Jane.
You feel better now, right?
Of course. What's that?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
What the hell you doing here?
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
From Leon.
It's from Paris.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Naturally, Comrade.
Bring me forty-five back.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Just for the honeymoon.
You want this?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
What is it, Anna?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You feel it, though.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
And there?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Yes.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
What do you wear in the morning?
A dress you wear in the evening.
Evening gown?
An evening gown.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What was it like?
Well, a hat...
Tell me... what else did you have?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
I see.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You should. I'll show you.
I have nothing to hide.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
About what?
And you too, Ninotchka.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
An omelet.
What are you serving?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Aren't you late?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Good evening, Anna.
Right now it's on the balcony.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
That's another thing... it's spring.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
I can tell you exactly.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
That's right.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Or we can't go back to Russia!
Or it might be the firing squad!
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
That's her.
Positively not!
No, that's not him...
Possibly.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
...and little Lady Beatrice?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
You wouldn't like Razinin.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
No, that's bad management.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
How many families live here with you?
What a lovely room you have here.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
What do you mean they might -- they will!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
That must be the one!
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
What is it?
Misha! Misha!
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
We don't like Razinin.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
He's cutting our throat...
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Capitalistic methods...
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Why should you be afraid?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Monsieur.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
No, no.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
We have opened a restaurant...
Guest?
Shall we tell her?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
But, Comrades...
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
I must be stern with you.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
I think I need my glasses.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
That's right.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Yes, Comrade.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
With two f's, if you please.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Yes, Comrade?
Comrade Buljanoff...
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
You didn't get legal advice?
Which lawyer?
Which part of the room is mine?
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
How are things in Moscow?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Oh, yes, yes.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
The former Duchess!
The Duchess...
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Very well, Your Highness.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
That's all right.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good morning, Gaston.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Have you?
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
I am, Gaston.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Eight forty-two, sir.
What time have you, Gaston?
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Go to bed.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Good evening, Monsieur.
Good evening, Gaston.
Certainly.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Yes.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Your Highness...
Thank you, Louis.
Is this satisfactory?
That's perfect!
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Count d'Algout...
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Good evening, Your Highness.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... 
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Let's do that.
While you eat, you look at the view.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
It is Thursday!
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
Leon, my little boy.
What is it, my boy?
Yes, Leon...
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
We can call our ambassador.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
We can wait.
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
No, no.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
What did she say about me?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
I'll send you a muff.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
Razinin.
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
What proposition?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
Get out of here!
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
But you can't...
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
If you want to see us you must come later.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
We don't want to be disturbed.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
Look for yourselves.
Bad news?
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Brave... that's right.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
A cow?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A day.
A week?
Two thousand francs.
How much does this cost?
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
Comrade Buljanoff...
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Right away... instantly!
Yes, monsieur.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
That's even better.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
Monsieur.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Just looking around.
Yes, monsieur?
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
What's new?
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We may have a chance.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
...and Kopalski.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Even the swallows are back.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Well, we're back home.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
If there is anything we can do for you...
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Yes, Comrade.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
We did it with the best intentions...
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
We did our best, Comrade.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
What's that?
No, thank you.
Allow me, Comrade.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
Au revoir.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Yes. It is unfortunate.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
You want me to go in there?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
What can I do about it?
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Give me another double brandy.
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
What for... why?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
On what?
Why should I take a chance?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
You're going to force us... huh?
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Oh no. No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
No visa.
Yes!
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
I think so too.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
But you had!
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
You believe in our cause?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
Confess what?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Private.
What business?
Business.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Don't hold that against me... please!
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
So happy and so tired.
Yes, sweetheart. 
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Please.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
It is their wish.
Is this the wish of the masses?
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
They belong to the people.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Who cried that one?
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
...but big.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
But I can throw it out of the window.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
No, no music.
No music.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
It's dead.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
What shall we get? The news!
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Radio! What is radio?
Let's turn on the radio.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
All right.
Much happier.
Would that make you any happier?
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Our salute will be a kiss.
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
All right, we'll make it red.
Not white, darling.
Yes... a little white house.
Are we going to build our little house?
No. Nobody will find us.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No speech.
No speech?
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Comrades! Good people of France!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
Shhh! Shhh!
I must talk to my brothers!
Darling, darling... please!
Comrades! Comrades!
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Thursday.
What, darling?
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
You must, darling.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Go on.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
A funny story?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
And General Savitzky.
How do you do?
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
My darling.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Ninotchka, I love you.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
I don't think so.
Did you make any change in this room?
I promise... I swear.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
No... go on.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
You see I couldn't shout that.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
It's nine o'clock.
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
You see? Life can be so simple.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
You remember this room?
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
I don't look too foolish?
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
No.
Not funny, huh?
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
I don't think so.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
No.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
I wish they had never met.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I have never heard one.
Do you like Scotch stories?
Probably not.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
On which boat?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
Then you should go back to your table.
Because we are an odd couple.
Why?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
At what?
Just smile.
Why?
Will you smile?
What?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Must one always be after something?
What are you after?
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
This is a place for workmen.
I always eat here.
Then how did you get here?
I didn't follow you.
I don't like your following me.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Room service speaking.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Then do it through my lawyer!
You know I want to...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
As a representative of Moscow...
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Let's forget that we ever met.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
I must go.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Oh, let it ring.
The telephone is ringing.
Glorious, analytical...
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Thank you.
No, that was restful. Again.
Was that talkative?
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
It's false sentimentality.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
It's twelve o'clock.
Do you hear that?
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Wounded? How?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
The bayonet? Did you really?
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Don't do it, please.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
You repeat yourself.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
Thank you.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
That is correct.
Ni-notchka.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Thank you. Thank you.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
And what do you do for mankind?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
And what is your profession?
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
I will start with you.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Is that customary?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
What do we do now?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
He takes good care of that.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Yes.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
I will do my best.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
So that is your house?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Yes, it is.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Yes, very strange.
That's a strange angle.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Go ahead.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Your type will soon be extinct.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
I'll try.
Suppress it.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
And where are we?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Why do you need my finger?
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
How long does it take a man to land?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Love to.
You might hold this for me.
Can I help you?
You're welcome.
Thank you.
No.
In other words you don't know.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
What?
At what intervals does he whistle?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
How long do we have to wait here?
Gladly.
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Me?
You, please.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Now, please, Swana.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Hello.
Hello, Leon darling!
Do you expect me to believe that?
She's gone, Leon.
Has done what?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
What is this, Swana?
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
All right, I'll listen.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Yes.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
No thanks, Swana.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
Months, Swana.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
No... please...
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
How do you do?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Am I interrupting?
Yes, Swana.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana.
Is this your new dress suit?
Thank you.
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
That bad?  Old or young?
You can't imagine.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
You haven't seen her yet?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Make it ice cold.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
No.
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Huh?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
What did he say?
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
What does he say?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Did I hear something about jewels?
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Oh, yes.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Now, Swana...
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Oh, Leon!
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Those newspaper people?
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Did you win?
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Good morning, Swana.
Hello, Leon!
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Go on.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Unfortunately.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
You leave me no choice.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Where are they?
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Where are they?
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
I told you to go, madame.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
In that case I can only say good-by.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I must insist that you leave.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Madame, if you...
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
I must ask you to leave.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
We have nothing to discuss.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
What?
Good morning.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
That depends on the tip.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Why?
May I have your bags, madame?
What do you want?
Here, please...
I will do my best.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I don't understand.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Yes... leaving immediately.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
May I ask what has happened?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
No.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
Thank you.
Cigarette?
Please... sit down.
May I ask why?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Yes.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes, it does.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Good morning, Comrade.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 
The future of the common people.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
Raw carrots and beets.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
This will do. 
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
Where is it?
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is that?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where do you eat?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where to, madame?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
My jewels?!
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
You did say it, sir.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
We'll see about that ...
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
How's the job coming, Bob?
Then his office will be fine.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
So ... let's go ...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Where the hell is he?
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
I understand that, sir.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
No, we have nothing to hide.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
Uh huh ...
We could get that.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
How much do you need?
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
I like that.  That's a solution.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
What?
Executive clemency ...
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Son of a bitch.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
To protect his people.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
Is it?
I'll bet he would.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Yes ... I got the money.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Yeah?
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
I figured that out.
It's a code or something.
You think this is just about politics?
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
How so?
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
Why me?
You do it.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
What about England?
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
No, you didn't, Bob.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
The country's loving it.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
I thought the gloves were off.
We can't touch Hoover --
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Why not?
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
No, sir.
This is not a joke, John!
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Pay him.
He wants money.
And?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Where's Hunt now?
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
I like it.  I like the idea.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
McCord? ...
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Mitchell?
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Jesus!  Through a window?
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
Sir?
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
I know it well, sir.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
I don't know anything about that.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
That's right ...
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
How do you see this?
That was civil war.
Lincoln used it.
The army?
And if I stay?
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
Can we get around this, Al?
Sir, the deadline is today.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
So?
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first.  And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
He's completely lost touch with reality.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
Cox!  Fire him.
Who?
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
About a dozen.
For what?!
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
That's what they're doing.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
'Night, Al.
I don't have a pistol.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
No, sir, you did not.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
There's no secrets here, Al.
May I say something, Mr. President?
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
... go on.
Sorry ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
This is June twentieth?
Sir ... six bodies.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
No ...
More light, chief?
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
What about the documents he promised?
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
When I met with him, he said ...
How?
We could leverage Helms.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
Because they're not Americans.
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
Sir?
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
I believe you're right, boss.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Let him finish, Bob.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
Sir?
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
What?
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
We really must go, Mr. President.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Mr. President!
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
It's the parents' fault really.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Run 'em over.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Sir?
Money.  Follow the money.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
You never told him?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Jesus!
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
No!
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
Where are they?
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
Sir?
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
How is this national security?
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Just do what I say, Bob.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
All right.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
"National Priority."
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
"Security" is not strong enough.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Silence!
But what are we paying him for?
What do you mean, sir?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Well, why not?
We were working on China.
Fucking hell.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
I did?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
What's Liddy got?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Their fourth!
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
What about happiness, Mother?
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Thou must.
I can't ...
Is it my turn?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Yes, Mother ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Why me?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Mom expects great things from you ...
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
What ... ?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
What'd you say?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd he say?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
No.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
So President Kennedy thought.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Yes.
Mr. Castro.
What?
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
And me? ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
Yes ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
My friends call me "Mister President."
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Ummm...
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
... little Bobby.
Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
I always get my man.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Kissinger?
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Who do you think is behind it?
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
We took his system out.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
The old queen did it on purpose.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
I know ...
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
You'll win the nomination.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
I never met the man.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
You should ask Bobby.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Oh, my goodness ...
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
Winning?
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
I won't tell him if you won't.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Where'd you find him?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Who we working for?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
You're fucking me.
The White House.
Why, you got a customer?
They're around.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
How the fuck did you know?
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Mein Kampf?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
The American people put me where I am.
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
What do you mean, Jack?
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Agreed.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Her name's Sandy ...
She's quite pretty.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
We'll see about that.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
Yeah ...
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
... as the old alliances crumble.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
There's no other choice.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
No, Henry.  I don't.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
I beg your pardon --
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Why?
Yes.
Did you cry when he died?
He was a politician.
You don't think he was a hero?
That was Mr. Kennedy.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Yes, Mr. President.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Of course.
Just ... uh ... you know.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
I was the lesser of two evils.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
That has the added virtue of being true.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
Looks can be deceiving ...
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
How about Kissinger along with him?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Free, if you're the president.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
That was a long time ago.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You all right?
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
Jesus Christ!
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
How many?
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Uh, wait ...
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
That'll be the day.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
The lie?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
It was illegal, what he did.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
... Use his women.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Mr. Nixon.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
... but it was all we had.
But it was all we had.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
... give me a break, Mary.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
Ernie Davis.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Syracuse.
Where you from?
You're shittin' me.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Oh yeah, he's good.
Elvis I like, too.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
I like jazz ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Hello ...
Hi.
Maybe I am.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Yes, I understand that.
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Well, we could delete it.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
No, sir ...
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
Fire him.
Yes, yes.
Of them.
Sir?
Proud?
Compassionate.  Grateful.
So I'm supposed to be ...
POWs.  And their families.
What's in there?
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
That's right.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
Sir?
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Bernstein.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
The hell with 'em.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
We got the press this time!
There'll be time for that.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
It'll be over soon.
No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
They were for me.  They're mine.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
You're drunk!
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Don't be ridiculous!
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Why didn't you?
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
Thank you.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Hiding what?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
And what am I doing?
You.  What' you're doing --
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
No.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Tomorrow.
When?
Yes.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Congratulations, Dick.
You're a long way from Whittier.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Penny for your thoughts.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
You personally?
Yes!
They're all your enemies?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Because ... I have to relax.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Are you okay?
I've missed you.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
He looked old, didn't he?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Anything.
Can I just ask for one thing?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Then I'll be there for you.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
And then you'll be happy?
This.  Above all.
Do you really want this, Dick?
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
I don't want them to love me.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Buddy? ...
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Were you planning to tell me?
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
You don't have to go.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
Is that the truth?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Are you serious?
I'll do it.  No more.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
Dick, don't...
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
I want a divorce.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
Not that.  Us.
I'll concede in the morning.
It's over, Dick.
Amen to that.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It makes us human ...
It's hard to lose ...
I know ...
We lost ...
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Some say you are, Rocky.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Whatcha mean by that?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
The "crises"?
What?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
To what?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Someday, Dick.
Lost.
Won or lost?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
I'm... discouraged.
You're discouraged.
Most don't.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Nineteen zero and nine.
When did he die?
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
Yes I do.
You don't know what he thinks.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
How come're you doin that?
Yes, you've circled round.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
In Angola. Yeah.
That man that shot you died in prison.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
How fresh is this coffee?
'Predate it.
Want a cup?
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
Didn't know there was any.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I am older.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
How you been, Ellis?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How many a those things you got now?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
How's that?
You heard it?
Who else'd be in your truck.
How'd you know I was here.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Hard to believe.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Oh yes.
He's real all right.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Well what would you call him.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Uh-huh.
None of that explains your man though.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
Try "old" on for size.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
Yes.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
No money in his room there?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
No ID in her room?
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No.
Carla Jean...
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Yes ma'am, I do.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yes ma'am?
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
He can take all comers.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
He won't neither. He never has.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Some pretty bad people.
Who's he in trouble with then?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Would you tell me if you had?
Not word one.
Nothin'?
No I ain't.
You ain't heard from him?
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Yessir.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
How's that, Sheriff?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
You gonna drive out there?
Okay.
Yessir. It was punched out.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
No sir.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Well I don't either!
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yes sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
No sir.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Wasn't no bullet?
Wasn't no bullet.
What was the bullet?
I don't know. He ought to...
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
I'm ahead of you there.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Sheriff?
...Now that's aggravating.
I don't know. Oh.
So when was he here?
Probably must be.
That from the lock?
Believe you're right.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
I'm hidin' behind you.
What about yours?
Gun out and up.
We goin' in?
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
No. Probably I don't.
But you don't believe it.
That's possible.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
I don't know...
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
Mm.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
You figure him for a dope runner?
That's the boy.
Llewelyn Moss?
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
You sure?
...You ride Winston.
Uh-huh.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
The old boy shot by the highway?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
It could be.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Yes Sheriff.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
...This month's checks.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I don't know. Had dreams.
...How'd you sleep?
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I mean, would you care to join me.
I can't plan your day.
What do you think.
Okay.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well. If you say so.
Don't hurt no one.
I never do.
Don't get hurt.
I always am.
...Be careful.
That's very nice.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Hyah!
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I thought it was a car afire.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
Well I didn't see it.
I put it in, Mama.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I got it Mama.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
It ain't even three years we been married.
Yes. Things fall into place.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
To your husband.
You gave your word?
No. But I gave my word.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
...I need to sit down.
I wouldn't worry about it.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
No.
I ain't got the money.
No.
She'll be all right?
She'll be all right.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I can hear it in your voice.
What makes you say that?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What did you tell him?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
You know what's goin' on?
What should I do?
Hey.
Llewelyn?
I shall return.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Yes ma'am?
Llewelyn?
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
You should be used to that.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Uh-huh.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Yes I do.
Promise?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
You can't afford one?
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Llewelyn --
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
So... for how long do we have to...
Well -- how come?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Odessa.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
What're you goin' to do?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Goin' where?
Goin' out.
What're you doin', baby?
Yeah.
Llewelyn.
That'll work.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Just keep it up.
Big talk.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
I need to know that.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
What'd you give for that thing?
What? Quit hollerin'.
Llewelyn!
No. I found it.
Did you buy that gun?
At the gettin' place.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
That'll be the day.
It's full a money.
What's in the satchel?
I mean the nature of you.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You go to hell.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
And where is that.
I know where it's going to be.
What's that.
I know something better.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know where the money is.
Why would I let you do that?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
You expect him?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Is Llewelyn there?
Hello?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Where does he work?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Yes I did.
Did you go up to his trailer?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yessir?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
I don't know.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Airport.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
What airport would you use.
You from around here?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
No me mate.
How'd you find it?
All right...
Not a bleep.
...You getting anything on this?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
...Where's the transponder?
Screwgie.
Mm-hm.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Huh? What is...
Step out of the car please, sir.
What's this about?
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
No. Do you?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
So what're you goin' up there for.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
You know she won't be there.
All right.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
...I know where you are.
Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
I don't need to talk to you.
...You need to talk to me.
You know who it is.
Who is this.
I see.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Nobody. Accounting.
Yes.
...Me?
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
...Where you want me to put it?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Sir?
...Don't put it in your pocket.
All right. Heads then.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
How's that?
Everything.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
No.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
I didn't put nothin' up.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Just call it.
For what?
Yes.
Call it?
Call it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Sir?
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You married into it.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
You married into it.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
You've lived here all your life?
Yes I do.
You live in that house behind the store?
Well... I need to close now --
You said that.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
I could come back then.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Well...
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Sir?
...What time do you go to bed.
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Sir?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Generally around dark. At dark.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Now. We close now.
What time do you close?
Yessir.
See about closing.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You already asked me that.
Will there be anything else?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
With anything?
With what?
Is somethin' wrong?
I don't know. Will there?
...Will there be somethin' else?
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
I was just passin' the time.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
I seen you was from Dallas.
What way would that be?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
This. And the gas.
Sixty-nine cent.
How much?
No sir, it's unusual.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Okay.
Good. I need everything else.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
You on all night?
That's twenty-six dollars.
One room, one night.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
The kind with the most poles.
What kind of tent?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Somethin' like that.
You already have the tent?
Uh-huh.
Tent poles.
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Let's just call it square.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
It's all right.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
What room?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
I'm sorry.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
Yes?
...I'm wondering...
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
Okay. We can stop that.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
What do you want to know?
That's not an answer.
Well enough.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Okay.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Yessir.
Yessir. I understand that.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
November the 28th, last year.
When did you last see him.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
I do like you.
Then you'll like me.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
What else then?
Half.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Waitin' for my wife.
I got beers in my room.
That's me.
That's got two double beds.
No, one forty-two.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
What about one forty-two.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
Another additional.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
You want to change rooms?
Could I get another room.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
The option.
The what?
You tell me the option.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
No. You don't.
No I don't have it.
The heroin. You don't have it.
What product.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
To kill your wife.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
So was I.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Were you in Nam?
What did I say?
Pot metal?
I didn't say braze.
I don't mean braze.
Yes.
Cast iron?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I'm a welder.
What did you do?
I'm retired.
...What do you do?
No. You don't understand.
I been immobile.
Took me about three hours.
Not any way.
Not that way.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
It's called a transponder.
I know how he found me.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Sugar?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
How would you describe him?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
...But that won't last.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
What outfit.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Nam?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Are you in the service?
Yes sir.
Don't jack with me.
No sir.
Are you jackin' with me?
I got an overcoat on.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
No sir.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
I don't know.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
You do, I reckon.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
I don't know. American citizens.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
So she did witness it?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Could I have that in American?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
How is she?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Sheriff, I don't...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
...I meant your food.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
I know plenty.
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Little place called "Williams," why?
Any idea where it is?
What about it?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
That's a nice name for what you need...
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
No, I didn't have to.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
I know that...
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Tell him what you told me.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
We think we know where Betty is.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
You're lying!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
A woman can write a check.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Anyway, so what?
Junior year!
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Yeah?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Bad idea...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Did you send anyone out there?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
You think a woman did that?!
Jesus...
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
It wasn't a woman.
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
No, Elden, I need to...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Oww! My arm, careful!
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
...plenty
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
You should get the order you want.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
You must be joking.
They're fine... you miss it?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Oh. How come?
Great. Good. Content...
No, I was just... How you doing?
Need something else?
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
"Banners?"
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
I don't think I am.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
...what're you saying?
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
I'd rather not...
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
This is really awkward...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I better go check on them.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
I'm sorry.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
"Thirty-two?"
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Umm, I don't think that...
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
I am?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
...to see you.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Do you know why I'm here?
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know who I am?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Oh, this is wonderful...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Who are these idiots?
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Umm... yes. Back home.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Yes, ma'am.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I gotta go.
Do what?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
What are you talking about?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Well, you are.
All the time...
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Are you and Larry happy?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
I gotta go make dinner.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
The LeSabre!
What?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
It's all right.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
No... what about your sister?
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh, Betty --
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Did you watch it yet?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Thanks...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
George...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
David, please --
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you doing this to me?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Ad lib?
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Yes... maybe it was.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
Didn't I?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I don't think your friend likes me.
I know. It's up to us.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Of course.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
What happened when you were twelve?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
You told me that two hours ago.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Yes, she is.
Lyla's very nice.
You're late, Eric.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Why do they keep calling you George?
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
You never gave us a chance...
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
You knew Del?!
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
No, Del.
Oh, you mean Fred.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
That's very kind of you.
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
I beg your pardon?
We were engaged.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
I don't know.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
I came for love...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That is a skill!
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
They're new to us...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
...well, then you ain't got much.
I got you, Del...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
What?
...like the water purifiers?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Sure you don't want any salad?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
What was that?
What's so special about it?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I ran back in to get the phone.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
So, call me when you --
It's not really a good time, guys...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
You're in serious danger!
Roy! What are you doing here?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
It was Chloe...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Yes.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
What're you doing here, Roy?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Uh-huh.
Make sure it's elevated...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
You made out alright.
Worse.
Like Rome?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Dr. David Ravell.
What's his real name?
How did you know?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
No. Loma Vista.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Really?
I left my husband two days ago.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
That's horrible!
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Did you love it?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Los Angeles, California.
Where you headed, Betty?
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
I'd slap his face.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
I begged him to let me put that on!
What's the matter here?
...did I win some contest?
She called you 'George,' George.
I married a car salesman.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Your husband?!
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
I have to leave now.
Where are you going?
...this is your sweater, right?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
What are you doing?
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Rosa, so you've met David?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
You should have a little faith in people.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Rosa...
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
No, almost never.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
He is real.
Does he know you think he's real?
You still in love?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Were you with him this whole time?
You never know who you'll see.
Looking for someone?
Umm...
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
What are those for?
...okay.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Fine.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
HE IS REAL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
What? Where was he?!
Doctor David Ravell.
Who?
Guess who I saw today.
I was talking about what you could wear!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
How many men have I talked to?
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
God, that's awful!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
He has a wife?!
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
The Five?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
The one you were telling me about?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Man, that is love.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I came for love. My fianc is here.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
You don't sound like you're from here.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You're hurting him!!
He has no heartbeat!
What are you doing?
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Good.
No, that should be more than --
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Really. And where was that, old man?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
The fuck you talking about?
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Huh?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
...and put them in your mouth.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
My socks?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
I... I don't know...
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Like what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
No...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I don't follow...
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Of what?
Could you give us an example?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
What do you mean?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Fine. You got five...
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
If we're for real?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Ahh... my wife's.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
What's wrong with you?
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
You made your point...  I was wrong.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
I said 'got it?'
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
It just didn't fit her profile...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
A doctor on the show... why?
Who's this?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Wesley...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I never said that I believed...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
What doesn't?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
What?
I'm not telling.
Where? Where is she?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
No.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
We should go.
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
How'd they describe her?
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
Worse... you're in Texas.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
I know that.
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
What?
Half.
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Like... us?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
...among others.
Joyce was screwing Del.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
I hope you're right...
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Should I kill him now?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
We can live with that.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
...that's a good motto.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I wanted to make a statement.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
It's not here. Let's go.
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
What 'look'?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
He told us it's in the Buick.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
You told me how to do it!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
IT SURE IS!!
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
A mark, huh?
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Hell of a way to die.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Now, that's really stupid.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
That is so right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That's right.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Relax, we brought the cash.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Beer, please.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
What do you mean?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Betty was a lovely child.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
This is Betty at twelve.
...who doesn't?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
I see.  May I?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Oh, five years, give or take.
...and how long did she work here?
"Injuns?"
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
He's waiting...
Jesus Christ!
You better believe it.
Really?
It is, if you like idiots...
Seems like a nice place.
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Isn't that the point?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
What'd you get her?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
I SAID FORGET IT!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
No! Let me try this!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
Is there a problem, George?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
What the hell's going on?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
...yeah.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Hmm?
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
I said I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I'll think about it.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I don't know, George...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Can I have an evil twin?
We know that...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Sure.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Oh fuck...
Better.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Uh-huh.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
Would you say she was ambitious?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
What did you say?
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
No... before that.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
David Ravell.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
I swear to God!
You lie, motherfucker...
She's a lesbian.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Did Chloe crack?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Huh?
Mr. Campbell?
Yeah?
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
"A Reason to Love."
Her show?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
It ain't the law!
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
- and share one of your graves.
Hang on there -
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
You can't do this -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
Waitaminute -
- but now it deposits you here.
Waitaminute -
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Good Lord, what do we do?
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Huh?!
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Do not seek the treasure!
...Pete?
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
That's right!
You mis'able little sneak thief...
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Gopher, Everett?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That ain't it!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Oh, okay.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Everett, my beard itches.
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
He was never turned into a frog!
'N turned into a frog -
Oh my God!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Okay, Everett.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Not that I'm aware.
Pete have a brother?
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Uh, we uh-
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Whuhh...
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Yeah, look at me.
Where's Tommy?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Izzat right?
Four hundred, Delmar.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Gopher, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Fire! I hate fire!
What do we do now, Everett?
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
How'd he know about the treasure?
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
What's his name again?
Assa good idea, Pappy.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Problem a p'seption.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
Okay, Pappy.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Not out the other side his face, though.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Vernon Waldrip.
Powas p'suasion.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Helluva idea.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Pullin' ah pants down...
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Ass right.
Helluva awgazation.
Devil his due.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Suckin' away.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Latch right on to that tit.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
In any state.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Well sure, honey, but...
I counted to three, honey.
That wasn't my doing...
Yes, but honey -
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Uh-huh.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Well, we need that ring.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
You -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You said -
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Not your...
That's not my ring.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
That's good, honey.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
That's right, honey.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
No weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Where's your ring, honey?
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Now Penny, stop that!
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Pete... I do apologize.
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
But...
But... but...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Well, but Pete...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Aw, that's all right.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
It was a moment a weakness!
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
Isn't it, uh...
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
An' all my meals for free...
Million point two.
A million dollars.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
The preacher said it absolved us.
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
That don't make no sense!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
You didn't know that at the time!
Who was fixing to betray us!
It was in his bureau.
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
Don't I know it.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
I am. Hur you?
Who's the honcho around here?
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
It was a powerful air.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
...Yeah?
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Buyin' nipples!
She's at the five and dime.
He's a suitor!
It's bona fide!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
That's a maiden name.
Blooey!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
He ain't our daddy!
Daddy!
Naw. That's over with.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I never said any of that!
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I wrote. Not every week...
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Yeah, I know.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Great ass.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Who's that?
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Who gave you this idea?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Why?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
You... in the Navy?
I joined the Navy.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Neither have you, pard!
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Hi, Byron.
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
Thank you, sir!
Okay, okay. You win.
What for?
Come back here, kid!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Great.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
I been calling for four months.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Yes, sir.
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Yes, Sir.
You, Zack?
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Zack, we've got to go.
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Good morning, girls.
Great. You can go in my place.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
I don't mean anything by it.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
A long time ago.
When did this happen?
Yes, Joe.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Come over here where I can see you.
Joe!
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Well, goodbye.
I know.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
You're good.
Yes, sir!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Aw screw it...
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
It's important, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Yes, sir!
Mayo, are those your friends?
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
No, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
I want to fly jets, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly, sir!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I want your D.O.R.
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Not exactly, sir.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
What's your name, boy?
No, sir!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Zack, don't!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
No, sir.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Where are you from, boy?
No, sir.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir.
No, sir!
No.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
I didn't call you anything before that.
Before that.
I called you Sarge.
What did you call me, boy?
Pardon?
What did you call me?
How're you doing, Sarge?
Hi, son.
Yes, sir!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Yes, sir!
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Yes, sir!!
Louder!
Yes, sir!
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Yes I do!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
What are you tired from?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I said, come here!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Well, I'll be goddamned.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
What?
Sid, there's no baby.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
You what?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
What other issue is there, Sid?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
How late?
I'm a little late, that's all.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Then, I'll see you around.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Or we could do that yeah.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
You're sure it's okay?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Something tells me you've been here before.
We don't have to talk at all.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Yeah.
Vietnam?
He was. He died.
Is your brother a flyer?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
No! That's not true!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
God help you, Lynette!
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Lynette, where's Sid?
I do.
No. I never feel like that.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
No way... Would you?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
What do you mean?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I haven't made up my mind.
You serious about having him over?
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
You hope.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He ask you out for next weekend?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
How did it go with you guys?
But in what ways?
Everything was different.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Yeah... Mmmm...
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Great.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
I got my foot on the floor.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Come on. Let's go dance.
That was you guys, huh?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
One more minute.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
And you turned him down??
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
What did you tell him about the baby?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
That's brilliant.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I bet you do!
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Because he's my friend, too.
Why?
I'd like to come with you.
I don't know where that is.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Why'd he do it?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
So?
I'm looking for Sid.
I know that.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Twenty-two years ago.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Your real father?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
What would you do differently?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
No. Is that what you want?
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
That's okay. I'm used to it.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
No, they're for your mom.
Are those for me?
Hi.
When I'm good and ready.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
What's the matter?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Does it still hurt?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
God.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
What's stopping you?
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I don't want you to move.
I'll get it if you want.
Want me to get a towel?
It sure was.
That was great.
Any time, sailor.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
I've never had a girl.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
You're better than candy.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
That's it?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
I know who you are and what you want.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
I'm starving.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
You stayed after all.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
Be a friend. Leave.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Forget it. Just get out of here.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
There's always a choice.
He didn't give you much choice.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
My kinda group!
I vote for the motel.
Me, too.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Do you go to school?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Not me.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
You got a girl?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Really?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Seriously.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
He said he grew up poor?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
Yeah. All week long.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
I can't risk it.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
How do you figure that's your bunk?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Sid, what happened?
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
It's mine.
Do you know that for sure?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
But she expects you to marry her?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
But it can't wait.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
No problem, but who's Susan?
Thanks for covering for me.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
A little.
That isn't true, is it?
Naw.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Yeah.
Hey, you guys still awake?
Sure.
You okay?
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Shhhh...
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Could you believe those girls!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Jets.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
I've seen better.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
NOT THAT ONE?!
Not that one.
The walls are steel, right?
You know how this gotta end.
Bullshit.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
Get the fuck away from me.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
-- posed to mean?
You finish.  Then we finish.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
That's their problem.
That's your problem.
She better.
She's gonna handle it.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
Are you gonna open the safe?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
The hell does she want?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Are you okay?
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
You got an idea?
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Th --
I can't just...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
This is ridiculous...
One.  Squeeze.
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
I can't...
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
I can't.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Please...
Remember that.
Yes.
I have the gun.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
That's right.
Me.  I am.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Stop it!  Stop it!
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
The fuck did you do that for?!
You should see the look on your face.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
He said open it.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
There is not one thing funny here.
God.
What the fuck is funny about this?
She didn't.
What if she called the cops?
Peace out.
You're welcome.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
No problem.
Not with me.  Not with people.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
What?
Adios.
I mean it!
Yeah, whatever.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
What about us?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Do me a favor and don't talk.
And we're never getting in.
Hey.
She's never coming out.
Shit!
Cell phone.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
They're gonna die in there!
They're coughing.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Be quiet.
I did.
Open it.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
She said she did.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Shut up and let me think.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Shut up.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Pure idiot.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
Different tables.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Where did you get this clown?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Asshole.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
They won't get hurt.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Who is this guy?
You're an idiot.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Keep your voice down.
Fuck!
I know.
Fuck.
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Huh?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Oh, that phone call...
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
You don't look so good.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Can we come in?
No, you can't come in.
We'd like to come in.
What do you want?
Can we come in?
Somebody called you?
I don't get it.
'Bout four o'clock.
Huh?
Everything okay?
Yeah?
Not at all.
That door is a safely hazard.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Oh, I've seen these...
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Could the child please stop that?
Master closet.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Master bath.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
No ball, kid.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Don't!
Push that button for me, will you?
I said open the door.
That's highly inappropriate.
Open it.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
A what?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Observe.
Nobody leaves.
Suit yourself.
The hell we are.
We're leaving.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
No fucking way.
Cut it back a little bit.
It's just the woman and the kid?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
It's okay, Raoul.
Watch your mouth.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Open the door.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
The furniture guy?
No, Edgar Allen.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Ever read any Poe?
Why?
Makes me nervous.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
What?
Something's weird.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
How many more do we have after this?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
Okay.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Where is the Glucogen?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
What if I spazz out?
What if I do?
Not an option.
What if I keep dropping?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Huh uh.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
What?
I was trying not to tell you...
Why?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He WILL.
He --
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Stop it.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He won't even know who it was.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Uh uh.
He'll do something.
On it!
Call Dad!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Blue is phones?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
I saw something, I saw...
What are you doing?
Close it!
No.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Do it.
Shhh...
We're never getting out of here.
Come on, come on...
Got him!
"Titanic."
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Morse code?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
What, what, what is it?!
I'm here.  I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
I am.  I'm here.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
To prove he wasn't chicken.
I don't know, why?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Don't though. 
Small space?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Are you freaking out?
Give me a break.
Oh, please.
Get the fuck out of my house!
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Fuck.
Say fuck.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"What we want is in that room."
Huh uh.
Chills?
Nope.
Shaky?
Yeah.
Feel okay?
I heard you.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
What if they get in here?
Wait.
What do we do?
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
What do they want?
Can't hear a thing.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
It doesn't work?!
Damn it!
PANIC ROOM!
What?!
That room!
He's going down.
People.  In the house.
What's going on?!
Fuck her too.
Don't.
Fuck him.
0150.
478...
The crowd goes wild.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
478-0150.
Well, I know that now.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Too many stairs.
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
No...
Fuck that, we've got company...
Alma I told you to...
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Those ain't cops.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Tyrone...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Uhh... I with it sister but...
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well... is it loaded?
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Lemme see that rifle son...
What are doing with yours?.
What are you doing with the gun?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
You know it brother.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
What's up?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
What the fuck?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Like?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Who's they?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Judge, calm down.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Yeah, it's me.
Inspector Brimmer
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
What are you crazy?
Get out of the fucking car.
What's with you?
Get out of the car.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
Yeah... whatever you say.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
I got you.
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Yeah.
So... we understand each other Judge?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Damn straight.
You know it. Stay Black...
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
You know that's bullshit.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Look this is bull...
Motherfucker... you stay away...
No Fuck you!!!
Man, fuck you!!!
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Naw... I gotta...
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
You got it. Berkeley?
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
...Glad you came man.
No man. PE -- "political education."
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
I don't know. Look around man.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Rodgers... this is no good...
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Jesus...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Are you finished?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Now hold on Rodgers...
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
You want me to put a man on it?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Can you make a deal with them?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
No sir he didn't.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Yes sir, I did.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir I was.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
You mean...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
We're working on that...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Alone...
So talk...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
C'mon let's...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
We're like policing the police.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
We need money first...
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
That's right brother... listen and learn.
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
Wait a second there brother...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Brimmer.
What's the pig's name?
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
What, I don't know how you mean?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
I don't know about that.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
They were empty...
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Right on Brother Judge...
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I'm down.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
No man. Gonna walk.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Yeah... let me think about it.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
I don't know.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
So what's the deal?
We appreciate your help with this.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
Yeah.
You were. infantry right?
Later for that. I'm done either way...
We'll all get out of here together.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Motherfuckers...
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
You alright?
Shut the fuck up!!
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Bullshit...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
What are you saying?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Fuck is up?!
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Sorry man...
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Nothing.
What's up with you?
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
If you got something to say, say it.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Huh?
Just the legit shit.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Fuck maybe... be there.
Maybe...
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Just a kid.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
And who is we?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Well, act like it. Come on.
Yeah, I do.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
I saw... but...
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Rose?
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Ain't no one seen him.
Where is he?.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
What?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
This cool the heat off you any?
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
My Mom's at that.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
I don't know. I really don't.
You believe that?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Yeah.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yeah... cop hit me...
You don't look alright.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Late summer.
When?
Good.
No.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
No.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
That would be nice, too.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
That would be nice.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
It's a start.
You call that a compliment?
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Uh... uh... I...
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
The hell I do.
You got me beat on both accounts.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
No, he takes after his mother...
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
Pride will do.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Well?
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Am I one of that sort?
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
I expect to try.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
You got salt last week.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
I know him well enough?
He's my father.
You don't know him very well, do you?
He's not making light.
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
Lovely.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Very well, then.
Of course, I do.
Do you?
I know that.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Excuse me?
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
You couldn't have known.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
As do you.
You look well, Charlotte.
Thank you.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
With a lace table cloth?
We did.
Who cared for your wounds?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
What unit?
Yes, sir.
You're surrendering.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Their names, ranks and posts?
What officers?
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Sir?
Prisoner exchange.
Very well, let us move on to...
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
I consider them linked.
That is a separate issue.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Thank you.
I will do so as soon as possible.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Very well, proceed, sir.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Oh?
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Shall we proceed?
As you wish.
Colonel will do.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Apology accepted.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
My pleasure, sir.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Do you see that, Colonel?
I understand, sir.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
How can we end this madness?
Probably.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Perhaps.
If I fail, you fail.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Are you going to meet with him?
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Sir.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
Yes.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
Go on.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
That's right.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
And what do they know?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
No, I don't.
You know what happened.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
She is.  Don't go in there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Don't go in there.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Where?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
I know.
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Cheraw Falls.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
What?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
She got me at a more impressionable age.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
No...
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Pride is his weakness.
Father?
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
These four wagons must be his.
I didn't see any.
Flanking riders?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
God help us all when you're forty.
You know how old I am.
How old are you?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Is it?
Yes...  ... father.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Yes, sir.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Did your father teach you humility?
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
Is that so?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Oh?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
It's safer if we stay together.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
What now, sir?
It's already over.
Father...
I have no choice, I...
You're in no condition to ride.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Not yet.  What happened?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Yes.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
And the Governor?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
What news?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
The middle colonies?
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
You don't hate him.
I don't care.  I hate him.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
He left us.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
I stand corrected.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Please.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Your son, what did you name him?
I hope so.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Goodbye, Harry.
Goodbye, Francis.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
It is ended.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
How many men have we seen die?
Don't touch him.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
Not held, just slowed down.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Long time.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
When?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
What are my orders?
I am, I think.
Who's in command?
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Where is he now?
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
We saw.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
I'm sorry.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Thank you.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Gabriel.
One of yours?
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
And your principles?
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
You said bribery twice...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
That's five, keep going...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
Name five hundred.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Balderdash!
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
You were an Englishman then...
That's a damn long time...
Thirteen years...
A long time ago...
Harry, Harry, Harry...
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
It's Mister Marion.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
Yes... you will wait.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Thank you.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
But what about Thomas?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Don't worry.
Four, five miles.
How far away?
Yes, he does.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
How many came back?
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
For what?
Thank you.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
Reverend.
And what is the second thing?
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
Worse.
That bad?
Remember Braddock?
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Earned.
Gray.
Put them away.
But father, they might come this way.
Put those away.
God willing.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Seventeen.
When?
Not yet, Thomas.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Father... I killed those men...
Quiet.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Father?
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Is that right, dad?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Yes--
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Well...I guess not.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Ayuh.
Bite?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Who might you be, little Miss?
I will. Come and kiss me.
Please hurry.
Of course I will.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Honey, Church will be fine.
Yaay!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Am I really gonna have my own room?
It's gorgeous!
I swear.
Do you swear?
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Ellie--
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
I'm sure you're not.
I'm not tired!
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Yeah, sure.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I don't get it.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
You believe in it.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Do you believe that?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
But don't you dare say that.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
What's up, sugar?
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Huh?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Ellie? What's wrong?
That's enough, Ellen.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
I hate that smell.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
I know.
Because you promised.
Yes.
Is he really all right?
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
To remember.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
For a little while.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Well, I thought it was safe--
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Yayyy!
No-I guess not.
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Yaay!
Yes.
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Was it Pascow?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
And because the dead walked.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Shit! Look at this mess!
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
Louis--
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Nope. He's your cat now.
It's Ellie's cat.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
This babe has said enough.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Well...a touch of the flu...
Rachel not feeling well?
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
What?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Yes.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
Wendigo?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Can I have another one?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Wouldn't wash?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
What did we do, Jud?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
But--
Because it's right.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Don't worry about that.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Your cairn.
What are those for?
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
I guess so...but...
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Why? For God's sake, why?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Whose burying ground?
This was their burying ground, Louis.
This time I mean it.
You keep saying that.
Almost there, Louis.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
It's funny, all right.
You're telling me.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Ayuh.
Is there quicksand?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
I'm not climbing that.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
What do you mean?
We're still not where we're going.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
What say, Louis?
Then come on.
Yes, but--
Does she love the cat?
But--
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
No need to apologize.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
I don't know.
Going to tell Ellie?
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Yes.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
It's Church.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
I think it is so, Ellie.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I can hardly read these.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Not yet...how much further is it?
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Sure.
You folks ready to go on?
What's at the end of it?
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Nice.
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
What?
Allman Brothers.
What were you listening to?
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
God, that's fine.
Good for you.
Not at all.
You need a glass?
Well, maybe I----
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
You don't understand--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Remember.
Leave me alone!
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
I'm sure.
Louis, are you sure?
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
You better get going, hon.
You're doing fine.
I'm going to try to do better.
Yes, I guess I do.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
That's forgotten.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
I heard you tonight.
Good d--
I got eggs down here!
Getting there.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Thank you, Louis.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Well, honey...you know that...
And Church will be fine.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
I just said--
That's enough of that kind of talk!
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
She's finally asleep.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I think it's rather extraordinary.
It's beautiful!
My God!
Did you see his shirt?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
The movers--
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Jesus, the road!
Gage's gone!
Come on--let's parole 'em.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Let her go. It's cool.
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
Aye, aye, sir!
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
How does he do that?
I will.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
That boat is my livelihood!
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You stole my boat.
He didn't waste it.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
No!  You gave your word!
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Elizabeth goes free!
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You can't.  I can.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
She.  Goes.  Free.
What's in your head, boy?
Or you could surrender.
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Aye, for us there is.
There's ... another exit?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
That so?
The situation has changed.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
What're you suggesting?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Why don't I want to do this?
All right then.
No, I really think I do.
That's fair.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
I'll watch my back.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
Track you down and --
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Wait as long as you like.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
I'll torture it out of you.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
That's right.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
No you won't.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Do you believe him?
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
Now?
Will -- you can't trust him.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
The curse drove you to gather this?
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
It's a pirate medallion.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Would that I could.
Then why aren't you eating?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Maid or not, it fits you.
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Can I trust you?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Thank you, sir.
You've got sand, for a maid.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
You have a name, missy?
Did you, now?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
I'll drop it!
Very well.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
That would hardly be proper.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
I know where your heart truly lies.
What?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
Not as a condition -- a request.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Commodore, please!
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore, you can't do that!
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
I can't breathe.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Very good.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Did he speak?
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Boy overboard!
Man overboard!
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Difficult ... to say.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
I knew it.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Ceremony?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Yes -- yes.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Yes, father.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
It would appear, so do you.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
I know the code.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
What?
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
It doesn't!
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
-- then we never would have met.
If I had known --
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Why would my father send this to me?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
I'm glad we got here in time.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
What's your plan?
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Exactly.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Nor did you, I noticed.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Exactly.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
Why?
Yes, the rum is gone.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
To the Black Pearl.
To freedom.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
More to drink!
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
That was before I met one, of course.
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
The trees are taller.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Come on!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Me!
You?!
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
You are despicable.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Miss Swann.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
How did you get off the island?
We're catching up!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
She can hold a bit longer.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
That he is.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
And you've got that, have you?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
A fool's errand.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Say again?
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Aye, that'll about do it.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
That we are.
We're not going to just surrender!
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
How did he get off the island?
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
What?  He never told me that.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
I know.  That was for the smell.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Raise the sails.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
We'll see about that.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Dead serious.
I said, no lies.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Smith.
What's your name?
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
This must be some important boat.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
Sorry, I didn't know.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
You would do that?
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
We had time to get to know each other.
Indeed.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Jack!
It's the right way.
Are you certain this is the right way?
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
Jack!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
I'll lead them away.
No.
This way!
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
On what?
Depends.
What's that?
Barbossa.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Just do it quickly.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Tortuga?
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.
That's not true.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
'Bootstrap?'
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
My father.  William Turner?
Is that so?
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Aye!  Avast!
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
It's still against the law.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Come aboard.
Good.
I'd die for her.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Why are brothering with that?
We need to go!
Not without my effects.
Agreed!
Agreed.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
How?  The key's run off.
I can get you out of here.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Because you're a pirate.
Why ask me?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Where does it make berth?
Somewhat.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Move!
No.
Move away.
Pirate.
You cheated.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Who makes all these?
Only a little.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Still --
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
He may be.
He's not telling the truth.
I think he's telling the truth.
And no lies!
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
... no.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
No.
... No.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Yes, I have.
You haven't seen it.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You've seen it?
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
No, it's not.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Please.
But --
A moment.
Commodore --
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
No.  She hasn't.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
What happened here?
Where did he come from?
He's still breathing.
My apologies, Governor.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Speak.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Until he's done.
How long do you leave him in there?
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
What did you use?
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
What are you going to do to him?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
Pollution?
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
No, thank you.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
You can't mean that.
To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
No.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Wheelchair accessible.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
I know what you're doing.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Ain't it.
How apropos.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
... plastic.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Not that.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Did you feel that?
Poppy, this is not the time!
If you loved me like I loved you?
Poppy, please --
What I asked you earlier?
Considering what?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
It will be an ascension.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Consideration?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Icarus?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Then you still love me?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Why are there two ottomans?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
No, Icky, this is real.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Do you think she loves him?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
That remains to be seen.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Nebbleman.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Icky!  What's happening?
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She says it's not.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Oh no?  Smell this.
You're not rotting meat.
Like rotting meat.
Donated to science.  Perfect.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Thank you, sir.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Shut up and do it!
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
The trunk.
Where did he go?
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
That might work.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
The nanobot is gone.
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
I like Trix!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Yeah, I do!
You don't want this.
Hey!
I'll do whatever I have to do.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Yeah?  So what?
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Who isn't?
You're afraid of him.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Is that what Argon told you?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Opportunity?
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
I don't believe this is happening...
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Of course, sir.
You're looking for a urine sample.
You were never invited to my house.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
What are you going to do?
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
The replicators?
Well, you got another problem.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
What did security say?
That's the guy?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
What did he want?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
A man?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Aaabout...?
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Susan!
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
So, I guess it worked.
Sir, please try to hold still.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
Like Crazy Glue?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
What's it smell like?
Okay.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Yes?
I guess they do.
Things do change.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
We were different people then.
God, what a fight that was.
I remember I was trying to help...
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
I have to!
You're not going after Argon!
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
The same thing I suppose.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Yes.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
We've got to get the nanobot.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
What in the...?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Susie... I...
Did you think I could just leave you...?
You saved my life.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
Let's go.
Argon's private lab.
Where is it?
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
The head shrinker at the prison.
Who is he?
On the counter.
Did you go?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
You made this out of my hair?
Like a glove.
That's going to fit me?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
What's that?
Getting used to it.
That's pretty good.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
No cheese.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
I could go with you.
Something else I want to try.
What did you want my hair for?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
I don't know.
How far can you stretch?
It's still inside me?
The nanobot... it's not here...
What's wrong?
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
No problem.
Do you have something to bring me down?
Probably the caffeine.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Yeah.  Old times.
Just like old times.
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Blame the victim.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
What's that supposed to mean?
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
Just look at it!
What about it!
Look at this!
What?  What's wrong?
Susan!
No, no, I just feel wired!
Is something wrong?
No, why?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
You're the doctor.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Isn't it already too late then?
That's right.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
What do these replicators do to people?
Three days ago it was.
That was an egg?
What happens?
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
The waste.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Got it.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
That was 'simple'?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
What waste?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Why do we need it?
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
Why?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
What are these?
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
We don't?
We don't have time for hysterics.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
Daniel!
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
Yes.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
You don't know?
I don't know.
What happened to it?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Mouse?  What mouse?
... just like the mouse.
The nanobot.
They did it to me!
No, something is really wrong... look!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
You're insane.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Yeah, we'll see.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
That's what I thought.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Yeah.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Right.  You predicted it.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
It already is.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
I guess I should be flattered.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
The big house.
The big house?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Is that so?
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Same old Daniel.
Somebody has to.
You know, this and that.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Been out for six months now.
When did you...?
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Daniel...
The question is, are you?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
Yeah, and what might that be?
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
You were looking for us?
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
That's right.
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Oh yes you are!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
You!  I remember you!
We lost him.
And you have him?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
It's a miracle.
That's impossible.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Icky!
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
I could have you fired right now.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Vermin...
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
What in the hell?
Yes, he might be.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Dexter.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Exactly.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Yes - Sing Sing.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Goodbye, Stew
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Yes - isn't it.
Indeed? How interesting.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
You're acting like a child.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
That's ridiculous.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
You can't walk out of here like this.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Stewart!
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
O-o-oh, I get you  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
Your house?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
What's the idea, Anne?
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
I see.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Are you crazy?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Anne, come here. Listen
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What are you talking about?
I'm not going!
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
I poisoned him.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Yes - isn't it?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Gallagher?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Gallagher!
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Oh yes you will wear garters
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
I know that.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
You wear them of course, silly.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Do you like them?
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
You have the cutest nose I've
Now let's get this settled
Of course I am Stewart.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Your place?
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
I'm glad.
A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
How-di-do.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Oh, Mother!
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
You don't wear garters!
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Really?
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
For the letters, of course.
For what?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
Will you step into the library?
So, it's obvious, huh?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
No - give you another guess.
I suppose you're going to print them?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Where did you get those letters?
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
That's considerate of you.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
What do you want?
You may go, Smythe.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
You're all right.
Certainly. Right over there.
May I use your telephone?
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
No? Why not?
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Don't mind Mother.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Look! Look! The front page!
Mother!
Ah-ah-ah!
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Sit down!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Why
What is this person doing here?
Oh, hello Mother!
That's an excellent idea.
Oh, shut up!
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
I certainly will.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Thank you very much.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Oh yeah?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Yeah!
As one Tribune man to another
Is that so?
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
We were classmates.
Huh?
Yale '21, I believe.
Is that so?
I knew your managing editor very well.
Well, I should say!
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Oh, man!
This way.
Thanks, I will.
Fine. Have a seat.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
You're the Tribune man?
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Yeah - go on.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Yeah?
I bring a message from Garcia.
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
How's that?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
What do you want?
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Impossible. Put it on again.
I'm afraid.
Oh, is that so?
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
No!
No?
I'm not quitting!
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
Araby, my eye!
Sure.
Araby?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
My play.
What play?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
A what?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
That's so.
Is that so?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Mr. Schuyler .
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Well, when are you quitting?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
Yes, sir.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Why not?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Not on my own beat, no.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
It has been alleged - yes
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Come on, get going, get going!
Well - it's only April.
Right - for the first time this year.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Gloria Golden?
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
With me you can always do business.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Look, I quit!
Yes sir!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
That's a canary, sir.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
All right, outside!
Now Mr. Smith, now please
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Quite so. Quite.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Thank you, sir.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Oh no, sir!
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Drunk, sir?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Dawson, sir.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Your valet, sir.
You're my what?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Who are you?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
How do you like your bath, sir?
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
I bet.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Yes.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
That's a lovely dress.
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes.
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
No.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
What other girl?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
What did he want?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Who was that?
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Sorry, boss
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
It'll be ready in a minute.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Yeah?
Hey, Gallagher!
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Very good.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Here you are.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
What could I be?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Right.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
What do you know about Conrad?
Conrad.
Did who?
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Never even been to New Madrid.
To Old Madrid.
Been where?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
How far have you gotten?
Yes - and I'd love it.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Okay.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Hello, Stew.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Yes.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Right!
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Must be my wife.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Staring at us?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
I dyed one and washed the other.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Nothing.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
There you are!
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
How is her family going to feel about it?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
My error.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Not since you broke into society.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
It's the smoke.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
I hope you'll be very happy.
Thanks, thanks.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
I didn't run away.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Well!
There you go, talking like a woman!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
and those and them.
and that
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
You what?
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
And now for that twentieth crack
Yes.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
We just thought that
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
I beg your pardon.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
That's putting it crudely, but
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
She did?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
You don't.
I don't eat waffles.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, come right in.
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
I suppose you know why I came?
Holy jumping swordfish!
Hello, Smith.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Traps shut!
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Well, at best you might deny it.
You quit trying to stop anybody
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
I think you'd better go.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Good.
I have it here.
A statement? Good.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Hello, Joe.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
It's all right. Bring him in.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Sure.
Okay - you remember Joe
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I have. Double-strength!
Smythe, you've been drinking.
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Are the cars ready?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Double-strength!
Double strength!
Some bicarbonate - quick!
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
What is it, Smythe?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Heavens! The man's insane!
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
And you struck him right here in our house?
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
I beg your pardon?
Yes - the worm!
Have you seen this? 
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
All right, Grandma
Stop calling me Mother!
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Get out of here.
With pleasure, Madame!
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Why
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Very good, sir.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
That's all I wanted to know!
Yes.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Yes sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Yes sir.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
That's puttering, sir.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
I just putter.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Yes, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
No, sir.
Found no skeletons?
Yes, sir.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
No, sir!
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yeah.
Me, sir?
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Did you call, sir?
Yes, sir.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Now the lady said you may go
But I
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
The name is Smythe.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
I understand, sir.
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
What?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Okay.
Yes.
You sure you want to know this?
Ah.
... Sex.
No. I want to know.
It doesn't matter.
What?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What do you mean?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Sure.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah?
Mary Sue?
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Thanks.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I love you too.
Thanks ... I love you.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
... It's a pretty short trip.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I won't.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I had to say goodbye.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Sure.
Thank you.
What?
Wait.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
And they won't be able to tell?
Looks just like it did.
Does it look okay?
In my handbag.
Have you got any make up?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
It's okay. It's alright.
I'm fine.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
It can't be possible.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
We're in Pleasantville?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Like a drum.
Yeah. It does.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
But you can't go out there.
But I really should get home.
You can't go out there.
I don't know.
What is that?
No ...
It's alright. Let me see.
It's alright.
I've got to go ...
Wait ...
Yes she is.
No she's not.
She's crying.
What?
She's crying.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Here's my favorite.
Bud?
Bud brought it to me.
Where'd you get this?
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
I think it looks nice.
Having kind of a tough time.
Thanks.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
No, no ... Come on in.
I'm sorry ...
Oh, hi ...
Hello Bill.
Oh, hello Betty.
I'm gonna go now.
Where are you gonna go?
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
No I'm not sweetie.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I don't want it to go away.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
No I'm not.
Sure you are.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I was in a bowling-alley.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
All night?
I told you where I was.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Oh, George ...
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
How was your day?
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
It's better, Mary Sue.
Don't! Just let go.
With what?
I'm busy.
Why not?
Oh.  I can't.
We were gonna ... You know ...
So.
It's six-thirty ...
What are you doing?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
Trust me ...
It is?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
I think ... I might be ill ...
... Why?
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Sure is pretty.
Lover's Lane!
... Lover's Lane.
But where would we go?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
What?
You want to get out of here?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Oh, gosh no.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh yeah.
Really Biff? The keenest?
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Um ... It's ...
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
What'll it be?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
She won't go out with me?
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
Yeah ... How'd you know?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
What's the matter?
I don't believe it.
What?
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
No it couldn't!
But it could happen.
That's not going to happen!
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Okay, that's IT!!!
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
What happened?
Real rain?
Rain.
Are you alright?  What is it?
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
No. Of course not.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Thank you very much.
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
... How?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
One of those ... big beds?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
No. What?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
"Changes."
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
I'm fine--but thank you.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Oh, no thanks ...
Want some bridge mix?
No it isn't.
Oh sure it is.
It's not in ME.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Why am I out of order?
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
You're not allowed to lie.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
Okay--that's enough!
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
The basketball team?
It's like the basketball team.
Very well ...
I think I've got something to say.
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
It was accessible to everyone.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
Well--it was dark out ...
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
Still doesn't make it right.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Yes I do.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Yes I did.
Did you do this?
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Well, I never had to do it before.
What do you mean!?
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Dan! Arrest them!
I thought the books were blank?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
What is it?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
And where's that?
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
What?
How'd you know about the fire?
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
The other one?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Green.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Yes.
Mr. Simpson ...
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hello Bud.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
And you're sure about this?
Right here.
You got the admissions letter.
Honestly ... no.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Are you sure?
What?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
What?
How come I'm still in black and white?
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
Wow.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
No. She really liked you.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Yeah ...
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Sure.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
So what is it?
That's great.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
... Yeah.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
You're reading?
Nothing?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
The pages filled in?
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Sure.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
It's fine.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's okay.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Really? It seems so fattening.
Me too. Sounds swell.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
They don't have that kind of potential.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They're happy like this.
Well if I don't who will?
You have no right to do this.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
Nothing.
What did you do to him?
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Jen please ...
So what's the point?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
What do you mean?
He won't notice anyway.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
It's in your closet.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Jen, listen ...
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
JENNIFER!
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
What were you doing in a library?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
What?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
No way.
I don't think so.
Can we do any better?
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Those are my friends.
Hunh.
As a matter of fact he does.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Who's that?
To who?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Play along?
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Owns the hardware store.
You know him?
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
We're supposed to be in school.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
Just take deep breaths.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Neither do I.
I don't believe this.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
What's going to happen?
Oh God.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Noooooo!
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
I don't know.
What did you do?
I'm not sure.
What happened?
Oh my God.
YOU get lost!
Get lost!
God, David. Just give it to me!
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
No way.
Lemme see that.
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I like it too.
I like calling you David.
No I won't. I swear.
You're gonna forget about me.
I'm not sure.
Where are they?
Sure ...
Can I open it?
It was a prop for the school play ...
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
We'll just put up the top.
What do we do?
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Real rain?
Rain.
What's going on?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
They just grow like that?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
Hunh?
You want some berries?
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
What's that like?
Yeah.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
How?
Out there.
What?
So what's it like?
You don't know?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Mmmmgh.
Oh ... Right.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
... Lover's Lane?
Sure ... Where would we go?
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Oh ... Hi.
Hi.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Keeps going ...
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
That was sure swell ...
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Marmalade.
Scout?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
There's worse places.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
How long do you think you've been here?
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Just gimme the damn remote!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Because you're coming home.
Why?
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
I'm going to leave now.
OW!
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
EXCUSE ME?
No you're not.
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Why?
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Oh no? Let me show you something!
I didn't do anything wrong.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
... Only if they mean it.
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Look ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I had nothing to do with that.
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
What do you mean?
NOW!
Oh--well ...
I want a word with you ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
BUD.
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Excuse me?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Re-runs?
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
What?
I can't.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Well c'mere, young fella.
... Hi.
Hello there.
COME BACK!!!
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Where are you going ...
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Don't get upset.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
My name's David.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Because we don't belong!
Why would I do that?
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
What the hell's going on!
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
How much does it cost?
Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
Ooomph?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
That's right.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
McGinty's.
McIntire's.
What department store did they go to?
Yeah ...
Nice ... Nice ...
... Like Prince Charming.
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Her father.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Just a little--You know.
It's beautiful.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
No, that's not it.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
I'll never be able to do that.
What's wrong?
Open it.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
It's an art book.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Aren't you a little early?
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Yeah.
Really?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Well don't you?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Christmastime.
... What's that?
You know what I really like?
So they can have their hamburgers!
Why?
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Forget about that!
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Just listen to me ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
Yeah ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Yeah ...
Bud ...
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Oh hi!
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Yes.
Have you cooked the burgers?
... Yeah.
Do you have the lettuce?
Listen to me!
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
What?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
I understand.
I'm so glad you're here.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
Yeah ...
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
What's wrong?
Oh.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Bud?
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Oh GOD ...
Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Dream come true, hunh?
A miracle.
What happened?
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Free?
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
What's the rush?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Well here I am.
Yeah ...
Yeah. TV busted?
TV repair?
TV repair.
Cool.
Cool.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Yeah. 
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Hey.
Hey.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
No, no, no.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Ok, bye-bye.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Yes, I'll be there.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Well, I can't talk though --
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
So you can't talk to me?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Yeah but what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
This is Barry.
D&D Mattress Man.
What's the listing?
Somewhere in Utah.
What city?
Ok. Thank you.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
That's it.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
This is "Fly With Us?"
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
And what was this?
...yes I'm still on hold...
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Tell me why.
I just want to know where she's staying.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I....please don't do this.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
You're so scared.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Hey. What are you doing?
Call me later.
Goodbye.
I have no idea.
Why's it here?
It's not mine.
What's all this pudding?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Yeah I can't.
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
What?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I don't know.
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Are you gonna do it?
I feel really on the spot now.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
It's fine, but --
It's not cool?
I'm gonna call you back.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
I'm sorry.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I have work, I can't leave.
Why?
Yeah I can't.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
I don't know.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
I'm not, I'm very happy.
You look nervous.
No.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Did I say that?
You just said very food.
Hello everyone.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
I know.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
...please, I just don't want it....
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Please don't.
So it's ok if I bring her.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
That's your fault not mine.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Why?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Hello.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
Hello?
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
....this is your mistake....
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Are you telling me no?
I have to go.
It was cool last night.
This is not cool.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
No you won't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
I didn't lie.
You lied to me?
I know I did. But I don't.
-- you said you did.
I don't have a girlfriend --
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I need help.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
We got disconnected before....
Hello?
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
....what....?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
No. I'm sorry.
So you think you can?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Really? Please?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
I know but I....how much is it?
You don't even know how much it is.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Yeah.
Me?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Yes.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Uh-huh.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
You're going to work now?
Not very late.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
I'm going to work.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Hi....what....what's up....?
Georgia.
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Hello?
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
No.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
You sound very cute, very nice.
...yeah....well you have me now.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah.....
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
Where is she?
...yes...
You have a girlfriend?
No.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Really?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
It doesn't matter.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
Really?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
No.
Are your pants off?
...just talking to you....
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
....no....
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Sure.
Do you like porno movies?
No.
Are you watching a porno movie?
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
I'm in my bedroom.
Where are you?
I'm just laying on my bed.
No.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Nothing.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Hi. This is Jack.
This is Georgia.
Yes.
Hi, is this Jack?
Hello, this is Back.
So here we go.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
Ok.
You can't do that.
I'm sorry.
You left me at the hospital.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Let's go to the hospital.
What is this?
Yes I'm sorry.
I'm fine are you ok?
Are you ok?
I thought that you were anyway.
It's ok to ask that.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
I think maybe over a hundred.
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
For work.....
For what?
Where do you have to go?
This is nice.
Yeah.
This is funny.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
...what...?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
Yeah.
Do you wanna have sex?
This really looks like Hawaii here.
It's so nice.
Yeah......yeah.....
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Ok. Where are you from originally?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
yeah.
Where you married?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
I just wanted to make sure.
About six months ago. Why?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Yes.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
It's Barry.
Yeah?
Lena?
Hello?
Thank you.
Have a good trip.
Ok.
I don't freak out.
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
What do you mean?
I don't freak out very often.
Ok.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
That was good.
So what do I do then?
Yeah.
Really?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Hi.
This is Lena.
This is Barry.
Ok. Have a good trip.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
I don't know.
You don't think you'll go --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
...yeah...
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Yes no not really.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Oh that's great.
Yes? I'm trying.
Are you learning how to play it?
...yes I did...?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
What?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Did something happen; are you alright?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Ok.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Nothing.
What did he want?
Nothing.
What happened?
Yes.
Is everything ok?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
No I didn't say that.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
....No....
So that was your pudding?
....yeah....
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Yeah, no, I see --
You see?
Yeah.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yeah.
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
You were talking about the promotion --
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Yeah?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Yeah.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
No, no. I did.
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
You like her?
About six months.
How long have you known her?
Yeah.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
It's Barry.
Who is it?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
Alright?
Ok.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
Yeah.
This is funny.
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Sure.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Ok.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Really?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Are you guys hurt?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Oh My God.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
What do you do with all this pudding?
It's terrible, no.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
I saw a picture of you.
Yeah, not really.
Business is good, you're busy?
No. Not at all. It's nice.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Yes I do.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Hi.
Hi.
Ok.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Thank you.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Yeah.
There's a piano in the street.
I think that'll be fine.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Not very well.
Do you know them.
I don't know.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
I don't know.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
They don't get opened until eight.
They're not open yet?
No.
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Bye.
Ok, bye, bye.
Ok.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
For what?
Did you have my home phone number?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
It's a plastic, yeah.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
That's fine.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Sorry.
The police are on their way.
Please don't do this to me.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
I didn't do it.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Why?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I know.
Your hand is bleeding.
Why? ...what?
I didn't do that.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
On my knife.
How?
I cut myself.
You're hand is bleeding.
I don't know.
Well who did?
No.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Did you do it?
Yeah.
Just have you for one second, please.
Why?
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
You want her to call you Jack?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
No one will know your name.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
It's ok, take your time.
337.....I'm sorry....
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
-- and this is confidential?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
What's that for?
And your Social Security number.
Barry Egan.
And your name?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
What do you mean?
......and this is confidential?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Can I ask how much is this?
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Yes it is.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Hello, how are you?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Thank you.
That's that.
Can we agree that that is that?
Yes I did.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I'll say whatever I want --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
Now are you threatening me, dick?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
What?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
Who is this?
....I have seven.
How many sisters do you have?
.....Well yes I do....  But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
I didn't know you had a sister?
Sorry about that.
I think you have a call?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Like a psychiatrist?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Yeah.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
It's alright.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
Mhm.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
What's up?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
That was weird. I meant good.
Yeah.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
How's business?
Hi Walter.
How you doin' Barry?
Ok. You're connected.
Fine, thank you.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Can you hang on a second?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
It takes time to process --
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
I'm sorry.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Where you been?
Let's just figure that out later --  Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
Yeah.
....now: this pudding?
That's funny.
Yeah.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Ok.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Where you goin?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
What happened?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What's up?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
...I'll tell you later.
WHICH?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
Let's just leave it there for now.
So what should I do with the pudding?
No thanks.
You should go on a trip.
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You're goin' on a trip?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
Hi, Lance.
Good morning, Barry....
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
What is this?
....yes.....
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yes I'm fine.
You ok?
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Hey, good morning, Barry.
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
Alright, alright.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
No.
You have another house somewhere or something?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
Yes.
You have an ATM?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
What do you have in the house?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Please don't do this.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Wait a minute --
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
You gotta give me some money.
What?
I need to talk to you for a second.
Hi.
Hey.
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Well....what do you want, then?
Yes. Sorry.
Are you serious with this?
I'm sorry.
What is this, man?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes, yes, right.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
I don't really remember that.
I won't.
Don't puss out.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Ok.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I know.
You can't be late though.
Ok.
Seriously.
I know.
I'm serious.
I won't.
You can't be late.
Seven o'clock.
What time are you gonna be there?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
Nothing.
What are you doing?
Yes I am.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
What are you doing?
This is Barry.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
That's it.
Ok.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
I thought Latisha said you would --
Your expenses are your own.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
As soon as you want.
When can you leave?
That's cool.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Put him through.
Nothing.
What did you say?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Hello?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
What's the problem?
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
I'm only paying two of you guys.
So they'll go.
Ok.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Should I call you later?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
He did seem a little strange.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
It's fine.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
No.
So...did my brother call you?
Ok.
Just tell him to call me.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Ok.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Bye, Barry.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Are you ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
You ready?
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
We should be going --
Sorry.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's not bad, it's ok.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
It's ok. That's alright.
It's fine.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Then what's he doing here?
He's a writer, not a madman.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Once or twice.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
No one's forcing you to listen.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Now give the signal.
At your service, Count.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
Marquis? Is that you?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
What? What've I done?
Go back to your room. Quickly.
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
Why not?
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Mother's not half so blind as you.
By whom? The Marquis?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
"Turn you out?"
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
In part, yes.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Ow!
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Not now, or we're both done for.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Has he hurt you?
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
Yes, Abbe?
Madeleine --
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I must grant him his last rites.
Mustn't do that, sir.
Free his mouth.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
Of course.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
I'm here.
Abbe de Coulmier!
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
Then it must've been love --
NEVER!
Was it impotence?
Who's to say I did not?
Why was it you never took her by force?
Go to hell!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
AND DID YOU?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
I know, because I felt it myself --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
-- the passion in your heart --
-- that was lust --
I saw the longing in your eye --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
It's no secret that you loved her.
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
An innocent child is dead.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Your wig. Remove your wig.
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
NOW STRIP.
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Coulmier, you animal!
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
What on earth would that require?
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
A man after my own heart...
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
-- water! --
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
Valcour. His chair.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
His rug.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
THEN BUGGER ME!
Good day, Marquis.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
That's enough.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
You always do.
I have a proposition.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
What the devil --
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
He can't do that to me.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You mean to take us all down with you?
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
If you only mean to dupe me again --
Do I have your word?
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
You among them?
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
They can't be serious.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
And --?
Enough to discern its tenor.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
Don't be so sure.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
It's not even noon --
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Poorly.
How is the patient faring?
And my own.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
HER NAME, ABBE.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
As you say, Doctor.
You'd suffer in her stead?
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
He'll do no such thing.
What could cause a tincture like this?
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
I'll do everything in my power --
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
That's not our intent --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
No. It most certainly was not.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
Of course.
It was fiction, of course.
Oh indeed?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
I have.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
He's sworn to obedience.
And --?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Well?
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
And place my reputation at stake?
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
You find this amusing, do you?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
You're a sentimental man.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Shut down?
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Yes?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
Do you favor its publication?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Well...?
Oh. That.
And his writing?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
And he's never once attempted escape?
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
His wife's?
His wife's influence.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
A few indiscretions in his youth.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
It's a formality; truly.
Of course.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Yes?
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
But I am history.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
As for the author... shoot him.
Enough!
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben; I look to the future.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
Quite.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
I'll be waiting.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
"Well worth the dig!"
Yes?
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
"A habitu of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
Come now, darling, give it a read.
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
...yes, I've got that bit...
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
Go on, child.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
They've taken your clothes?
I don't believe it!
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
What have they done to you now?
What's that then?
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
It's a long story, this one.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
A kiss for each page.
Fiendishly so.
Is it terribly erotic?
Most assuredly.
Is it awfully violent?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
There's something else I want from you.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Did I frighten you?
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
Don't start --
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
No. But tell him I would.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
"...your wife."
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
This is neither the time nor the place --
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Good God, Marquise --
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
Of course.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
And I in yours.
I am eternally in your debt.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
-- words alone are insufficient.
Oh, but I am!
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
What thought is that?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
I am not a wealthy woman.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
I pray you: be succinct.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
You've come to lecture me?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
How was I to know, my darling?
Forgive me, I beg you --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
....shame on you, truly...
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Very much.
Doesn't that please you?
Do as I say.
But it's just begun --
Leave at once --
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
That poor woman.
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Am I?
You're just scared.
I wonder sometimes.
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Not you too
So you ever gonna do a picture?
Last week would this be?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Ever met Walter Winchell?
But I am That's the killer, honey.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Uh-huh
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Sure
I did my best but, well, you know me
And he did.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
He needs me here.
Sure you can, just--
I can't
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Mm.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
God, these parties are the worst
Houdini mice.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Do you?
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
I'll remember that.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
So I've been told.
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
To make pictures.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
And director.
The actor
My name is Orson Welles
Who are you, sir?
Yeah
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Bel Air is restricted.
Why is that, Louis?
Oh, why is that?
You know that can't happen.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Yeah
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Uh-hub.
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Over at RKO?
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Randolph!
Louis
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
I don't want you to--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I just want to understand--
I will not have this in my home.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
You are repellant when you drink.
You will not walk out on me
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
Not for me.
There's a different between want and
I wanted it
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
You needn't use that language with me
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
There is nothing to discuss-
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
I will not defend my life to you--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
There's nothing to explain
Then you explain it to me?!
I am not that woman.
This picture--
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
Marion--
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
One . . . buys things.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Yes.
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
How much?
It's not really--
How much?
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
Pops
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
How bad is it?
Don't
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
There. That's right.
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
There's no call for that language-
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
I want blood
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
He lied to me
Please be quiet.
Sir, I-
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Sir?
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir? 
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Thank you for your time
The drinking.
Yes?
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
How so?
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
I can't remember the lines!
Keep filming.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
I am not doing Hearst.
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
We're using-
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
Huh?
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
You are talking to him.
Can I talk to Hearst?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Uh-huh
Hearst?
That's right
He personally asked you to?
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
I wanna see the picture today
No -- no -- I mean--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Yeah, you're probably right.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
What have I done?
George...
Shit
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Mank!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
You gonna watch?
This ain't George's doing--!
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Kinda.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
It's too late. The movie's made
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
What does this have to do with--?
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Christ.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
So they're Jews. . .
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Hedy Lamarr?
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
Well, at least she's off KANE today
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
No, you gotta hear this-
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Hey, kid. Gregg.
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
I don't give a shit about-
Did I ever tell you about my father?
I don't care.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I want you back
I just can't . . see it anymore
Uh huh.
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
Jesus Christ --
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
But it's not a great syllable
Craig is one syllable
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
The title?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
What?
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
It's good, huh?
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
It's 350 pages long.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
And what does he see?
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
They don't have to.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
She was . . . innocent
Why her?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
How?
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
He'll destroy us.
NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
I'll hire you  -- right now-
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
It doesn't have to be
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
I don't have it anymore?!
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Fuck you--
Listen to me-
Let me out.
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
Don't do this
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Don't do this
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Sorry to disappoint.
I expected more from you.
Fuck you
So speaks the court jester.
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
We're doing Hearst.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Orson. Stop. Just stop
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Mank-
Please don't say this.
Yes.
Oh Christ
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Oh Christ...
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
This better be good
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Oh for Christ's sake-
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Jesus
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
The old man has his own way of doing things
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The great Spanish bullfighter
Who the hell's Manolete?
Manolete?!
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
Sigmund Freud?
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
But with compassion and insight--
Like a bug.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Right-
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Not for me.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Magic
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Showing life
Nope.
Telling stories.
What are movies about?
Forget it-
What are movies about, Orson?
Nonsense
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
Herman.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Oh God.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Thank you-
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Yes.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
May I help you?
Get out.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Get out
Yes
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Yes
You talked to New York?
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
You're lying to me.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're going to destroy it
That's for me to decide.
To do what?
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Very generous
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
It came.
Again
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Again
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Again
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Again.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Again.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
It was the best, kid
It was fun, wasn't it?
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
Oh God. . .
Happy birthday.
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
I don't want to sit
I think you better sit down
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
No, we're jake. But listen-
You're not still mad at me, I hope
It was a -joke, George
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
I really think you're
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
It's just that my movie is so-
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
For Christ's sake, shut up--
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Well it' s all you've got !
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Then find another theater
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
The ad..
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
They've all seen a rough cut
This is an abomination There's no music and--
Ah, it's a grand title.
For the title
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Please don't ask me to do this.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Jesus
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Pardon?
CITIZEN KANE
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
I'm Christ
He's Christ?
Yes!
Oh, no--
Yeah.
We done?
How 'bout a real drink?
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
I know what you want but it can't be done!
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Orson, you wanna take five?
For what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
About what?
They wanna talk to you.
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
We're from...
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Ok, champ.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
I'm Ok.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Hey champ!
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
How can he embarrass you?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
What?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Believe what you want.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
What who's been sayin'?
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What's up, Colonel?
None of your fuckin' business.
And where you goin'?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
Where you going at this hour?
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
It's not done.
This looks done.
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
Where's your wife, Jake?
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
You're a good sport, lady.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Whatsa matter with you?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Whadda ya mean?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
What?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
So what?
But you said "you."
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
What do you mean, "you"?
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
I did keep an eye...
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Well, I heard some things.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
No, I just told you what happened.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
When?
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
How's that?
Well, that's what I mean.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Where you been?
Screw you, Jack.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Except fall down like a normal person.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
See? That's all there was to it.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
C'mon, Joey.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
Yeah, I know.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
What did Tommy say?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
What do you mean?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Whatcha doin'?
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Nah, she would never...
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
You want the title shot or not?
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
You want us to wait for you?
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Do you see her yet?
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
You know, like bang her or anything?
With her? How?
You wasn't with her?
Huh?
You wasn't with her, were you?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Yeah, she's nice.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
How do you know? You know her that good?
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Go 'head.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Yeah --
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Whadda you care?
Who's that?
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Answer me when I talk to you.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Go ahead.
Jack! Enough!
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Here's your glove.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
You heard me, I said hit me.
You want me to do what?
Hit me in the face.
Sure. What is it?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
You know?
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Nothing...
What's wrong?
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
You sound bitter.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Does that mean...
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Three more, I figure.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Yeah. At night.
At night?
Nine o'clock.
What time is it?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
What friends?
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Don't make no difference no more.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
But they don't have a case against you.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
What are you doing?
All right, just don't make any noise.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
The kids are sleeping.
No. Open the door.
Are you drunk?
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Open the door, Vickie.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Sure, what else is new?
I'm leaving you Jake.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I dunno.
Why don't you just call him?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I don't know.
Then what?
No, not that.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Why don't you just call him up?
OK. Talk.
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
What?
Jake --
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Yeah --
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
You did?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're a fuckin' liar.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
With Salvy, eh?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
Jake, no --
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
I am answering...
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
What're you talking about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What was it about?
"Father of the Bride."
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I called. You weren't there.
I took the kids to my sister's.
Where you been all day?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I went out.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What's the matter with you?
Jake...
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
You're hurting my arm.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
All I did...
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
What did I do?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
Positive.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
I never noticed his face.
That he's got a pretty face.
What did I say?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Yeah, what?
Huh?
Yeah.
You asleep?
What?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
No, I'm not.
You're not interested in him?
I'm not interested in him.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Who asked you?
I was just...
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Oh, Jake.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Now take your panties off.
I like the gym smell.
Go 'head. Do it.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Now take the rest off.
Do what I say.
Jake...
Take off my pants.
Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Come over here.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
It's OK.
Jake...
That's all right. He don't mind.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
What does that mean?
No.
Can you see it?
Can you see it?
I can't find my ball.
Just give it a nice little tap.
Should I hit it?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
It feels real good.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
You don't talk very much.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I just wanted to say hello.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
How's the weight? Ok?
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
He should.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Never felt better.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
C'mon, Tommy --
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Excuse me for living.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
I said, let's go.
Right, the gym.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Hey, leave the kids alone.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
And you're drinking with them right now.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
It don't look right.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
No, you're his wife.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Goodnight.
He has it. Thank you.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Oh. When are they expected home?
This is the baby sitter.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
This is Doyle's house.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
But his leg!
Name me a better photographer.
Jefferies?
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
That's what they call a family problem.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Like disposing of their wives?
Namely?
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Where'd they take Lisa?
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Like an old hambone?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
A possibility.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Like what?
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
I told you that --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Your Lisa?
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Jefferies.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
That depends on who "they" were.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
All the things I hate.
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Your logic is backward.
But I'm not a killer!
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Did you ever own a saw?
You figured that out, huh?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
You sure it belongs to his wife?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Jewelry?
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
You think he's getting out of here?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Mrs. Thorwald.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Ever get an answer?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
A detective's nightmare.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Give him evidence.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
I can't do that.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
If possible -- both.
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Jeff -- huh?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
Who left -- where?
Who said they left then?
Not yet.
Feel a little foolish?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Six ayem.
What time?
-- until yesterday morning.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
She never left the apartment --
I think they missed their chance with her.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
I was jaywalking.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Do that.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Thanks.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
All right -- you don't believe me.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
His wife took a trip.
For instance?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
You think I made all this up?
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I'll bet it's been done.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Yeah.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Jeff --
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Something wrong?
It's me.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Gunnison?
Hello.
Next time, have some good news.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Like what?
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
I'll send you some comic books.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Read some good books.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
With that cast on -- you don't.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
You did.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Where?
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Wrong day?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
This is Wednesday.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
For getting rid of that cast.
For what?
Congratulations, Jeff.
Jefferies.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
I can't. The police have it by now.
Tell her to bring it back!
No.
Can you get me that ring back?
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I don't know what you mean.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Why should I?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Who are you?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Did you get my note?
Hello.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
What about the rest?
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Ten here.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
How much do you think you'll need?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
What do you need money for?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Smart girl.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Now wait a minute --
There's probably one in the basement.
No.
Got a shovel?
What are you two talking about?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Would four of them -- ?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You can tell that from here?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What?
I wonder.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Thank heaven that's over!
Look!
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
There's something buried there.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Mrs. Thorwald?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
You called the police?
Huh?
Police?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Uh-huh.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Get back there! He'll see you!
A Federal offense.
In this heat?  They're up now.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
What about this morning? Any developments?
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Isn't he a salesman?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
He and his wife splitting up?
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
And some man will lose his.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Keep your mind off her.
Depends one which one.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
I was.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
How did you know!
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
She pay you much?
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
People have different emotional levels that --
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
We've progressed emotionally in --
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
That's the hard part.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
You're never going to marry?
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
She's only perfect.
She's just not the girl for me.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Stella!
Her father loading up the shotgun?
No.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
She's all right.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
I'm not ready for marriage.
That's abnormal.
I don't want to.
That's normal.
She expects me to marry her.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Lisa Fremont.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I knew it!
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
It crashed, didn't it?
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
How?
I predicted it.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Goodnight, you idiot.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Who's Thorwald?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
It is something really important, Jeff?
Not a word.
You haven't even heard from him?
Not yet, Jeff.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Yes.
Mrs. Doyle?
Hello.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Shut up. I'm all right.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
How?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
What for?
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Too close.
Wasn't that close?
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Well?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Is he cleaning house?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
But you're not?
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Do you like it?
Thank you.
I'll rephrase the question.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Huh?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Who was the trunk addressed to?
I hate funny exit lines.
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
The same.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
I do?
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
That's a suitcase?
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
I have the whole weekend off.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
We have all -- what?
Don't rush me. We have all night.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Still -- those witnesses.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
That's what the witnesses told him.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Inside stuff?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
What doesn't?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Thinking about Thorwald?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Not yet!
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
I don't know.
I wonder where he's going now?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
Someone not his wife?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
What about it?
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
To get on home.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
125 West Ninth Street.
What's the apartment house number?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
No comment.
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Yeah.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
What are you getting at?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
There's nothing to see.
Lisa, please!
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe she died.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
What is it you're looking for?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Now, Lisa --
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Something too frightful to utter.
What do you think?
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Nothing, thank heaven.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Homework. It's more interesting.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Tell me about it.
So do I.
I have one now.
Don't you ever have any problems?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Without any future?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
I mean what I said.
You mean "goodnight."
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
Three.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Of course not.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Lisa! Shut up!
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
I think it's enchanting.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
How can you tell that -- from here?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
For what?
Yes.
You mean leave the magazine?
Make the one you want.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
That's good news.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Tired?
What a day I've had!
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Big enough?
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Something big going on somewhere?
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
Only because it's expected of her.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Uh-huh.
Anything else bothering you?
Not too active.
And you love life?
Empty as a football.
And your stomach?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
How's your leg?
Two minutes.
Chelsea 2-5598.
Phone number?
L. B. Jefferies.
Your name?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Good luck, Buzz.
What's happening?
Give me some dirt.
Feel okay?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
They always live.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Nobody chickened.
I'm glad they let you out.
Friend of yours?
A new disease.
What's that?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Steady Marlon!
We got to do something.  Don't we?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
I like you, you know?
Yeah.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Okay.
Sure.  It's fine.
Glad to meet you.
Hi.
Buzz Gundersen.
Jim Stark.
What you say your name was?
Stay there.
Just him.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Where can we meet?
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
You satisfied or you want more?
Somebody find him a knife.
Machismo?
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Chicken?
What?
Meaning me?
I'm cute, too.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
You watch too much television.
What?
You know something?
Down in back.
Any other entrance?
Smashed the front door.
How'd he get in?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
No.
You still want to go home, Moose?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
What time is it?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
No.  We're going to bring him down.
I think I should go home.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No--
You see any cops?
You see any cops?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
What's he going to pull--
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
He depended on me.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I don't want to learn that!
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
You don't want me to go.
Will you wait a minute?
Except yourself!
Well--
I don't think so--
You what?
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You're absolutely right!
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Will you let him tell it!
I was in it.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Go ahead.
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Well, now--
What can you do when you have to be a man?
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
We don't have time.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
Blood.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
What would you do, Dad?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Shoot, Jimbo.
Hey--I want to ask you something.
I'm not hungry.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Yes.
You awake?
I better clean this up before she sees it.
That's funny!
Yeah!  Shh!
And you dropped it?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yeah!
You thought I was Mom?
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
You make any sandwiches?
Mother--
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You can't protect me.
Hold it, Jim.
Tell him why we moved here.
I think I know my son.
You sure?
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Have some cigars.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Sure.  Sure.
Excuse us a minute?
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
Sorry.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Say, listen--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
You don't?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Frank!
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Is he there?
Open it.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
I still think you should go down.
See?  It stopped.
Look--just relax, will you?
Are you going down there?
He's home.  I heard the car.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
What's that pounding?
Frank?  I'm frightened.
That's right!
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
No!
Just relax, please relax!
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
I was talking to Jim.
He's just loaded, honey.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Well maybe she better start.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you hear from him, son?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Come with me, John.
Yes, sir.
John Crawford?
Head-shrinker?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
In my mother's drawer.
Where did you get the gun?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
Plato.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
I'll wait for him.
Come back tomorrow.
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
What's the charge?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Plato!
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
I shot at one of them.
Just a guard.
Who's that?
Come on!
They like you.  Okay?
Why?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
You promised to give it back.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
I need it.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
My gun?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
What do you think?
Can I keep it?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
No.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
You sure?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Here.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Why?
No.  At dawn.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
I'm fine.
That's swell.  How are you?
I know.  Light a match, will you?
I've got a gun.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I'm here.
Plato?
Get away from me!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Your father!
I don't want you for my father!
Plato!
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Who?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
When was that?
I came here before.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Not lately.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Isn't he schizoid?
I'm what?  What?
Man, you're schizoid!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Come on!
We'll take it!
There's only one key.
What?
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Isn't it crazy?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
No.  I'm scared.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Come out come out wherever you are!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Hey where'd you go?
Help me in!
Judy.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
We know.
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Yeah?
They're looking for you!--
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
It's me!
Who's that!
Jim!
Yeah.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Who has?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
No.  It's okay.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
I hitched.
How'd you get here?
What's a chickie-run?
What?
Who knows.  Plato?
Are you really going to meet them?
No.  In the morning.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
They're still there!
I'm here.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
No.  It's perpetual motion.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
He has a knife.
I just don't want trouble.
You scared?
I know.  That's why I came back.
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
Jim.  What's yours?
What's your name!
I don't want to make friends.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
What?
You shouldn't monkey with him.
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
What?
Boy!
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
No.  I don't think so--
You remember me?
Hi there.
Hi.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Do I have to spell it out?
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Just tell a little white lie?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Why should you be the only one.
What's that got to do with it?
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
Good Lord!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
And you wanted him to make a list!
Mom--I'm not--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
How!
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Goodbye, dear.
'Bye, Mom.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
All right, darling.
I'm sorry.
That's a fine way to behave!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
What?
You serious?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Okay--
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Chicken?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
If he could--
Pretty mixed up?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
What?
What a zoo!
She eats him alive and he takes it.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
But you don't think that's a solution.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
So then you moved?
They never do.
And your folks didn't understand?
He called me chicken.
Mess that kid up?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Try the desk.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
I don't know why--!
No.
Leave me alone.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Wash up and go home.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Get lost.
Grandma?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Plato!
Listen--
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Yes, ma'am.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
They're killing him!
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
After he tried to shoot you?
No!  I got to find him.
We have to go back!
No!
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
It is for me too.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I never felt so clean before.
So do you.
You smell like baby powder.
What?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
You disappointed?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
What a relief!
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
You don't need to do that.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Are you?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Why?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
What?
Hi.
Hi.
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Should we explore?
I don't know.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Ever been in a place like this before?
I bet you hear everything I say!
You can't talk underwater!
See, we're very modern.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
There's just one thing.  What about--
Well--we're newlyweds.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Oh, Jim!
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
You can trust me, Judy.
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
I'm never going back.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Where you going?
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I felt like it.
Why did you do that?
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I'm getting that way, too.
Why?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
No.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Neither can I.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
You cold?
I'm numb.
You still pretty upset?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
No--I was just--maybe--
You were looking for me, weren't you?
It doesn't matter to them.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
They'll be looking for you.
I'm not so bad.
Goodbye!  See you!
A what?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Oh.
The kids take me.
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah--why--
You going there?
Where's Dawson High School?
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Won't mother be proud.
See, I'm new.
Who lives?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Where what was.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
"Life is crushing in on me."
See?
Now that's true!
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Bully for you.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Hi.
Hi, Plato!
It's all right.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Plato, where's your father now?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Okay.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
What's he like?
Yes.  My best friend.
Is he your friend?
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
You said you'd call my father.
She's being called for.
My mother?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
I'll never get close to anybody.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
No.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
That one?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Do you think your father means that?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
He hates me.
What?
He hates me.
Judy--we're ready for you now.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Why?
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't want to stop.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
What?
Didn't you forget something?
Hi.
Good evening.
Daddy--
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
No.  Why?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
We were romantic then too--
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
How did you know that?
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Gabriel!
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
He'll be dead when he does.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
I've been doing good, though.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
-- till he fucked his parole --
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Searching for a money man...
To all those cons...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
...whoever she is.
He wants... your "sister"...
No, baby. He wants me.
He wants the money.
We're talking, aren't we?
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
NO!
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
You promised me!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
Gabriel, you promised!
YES!!!
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Don't hurt him...
Is this him!?
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
A man of some travels.
Gabriel!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
What are you doing here?!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Gabriel, let him go --
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel -- !
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Thank you.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
We sell children's toys --
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Toys for... adults?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
You can't find... what?
I never told you my name.
You said it a million times!
But I never said Rudy.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
No --
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
What are you talking about?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
What?
Merry Christmas.
I'm glad it was me.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who wouldn't.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You shouldn't have.
I saved your life.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You... you... YOU --
Yeah. That's love.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
Well. I'm going home.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
They all are. Football's on.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
No.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
He says he wants it now.
I'm almost done.
He wants to see your map.
Part of... with them?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Nick, what are you talking about?
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
We'll need one.
I don't know...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
What?
They'll have guns.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
I love you, Nick...
Don't say my name...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
You saved me.
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
Nick, the ice is --
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Nick, what happened --
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
That guy knows you?
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
So does it look a lot different?
Get your own room.
Nick...
Get your own room, Ashley.
We? What "we"...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
They're truck drivers.
They've never done a robbery?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
What?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
He working for them on this one?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Not without you.
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
No!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
I thought we'd have a few more days.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
Jack. Jack Bangs.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Canada.
Gabriel!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
...maybe I die for Nick...
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Nick died for me....
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Your pen palls dead, lady.
I love you!
You're in on this.
No, Nick, no --
You told him about Nick's letters.
Nick, please, it's me --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
You're not hearing me here --
He'll kill you.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Get the hell off of me!
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, I love you --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Nick, what are you --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick --
You sold him out.
Nick, no --
You motherfucker.
What's going ON!!!
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
What the fuck is going on.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
...the truck driver...
Your brother...
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
Nick...
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
NICK!
NO!
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
I'll see what I can do.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
We could live it up and --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Well, I don't know about that --
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Beauty and fragrances.
You forget where I work?
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You need a COAT!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Ashley, Jesus --
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Where the hell are you going?
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Yes it was all you --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Tell me again.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
No, c'mon --
One more. Smile. One more.
No --
Smile.
What.
Do that again.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
You are to me.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Saw me --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, no --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Radio said.
I don't think it's negative five.
Yeah.
Negative five?
Radio said negative five.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
How'd you know my name.
Ash?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Ash?
How'd you know my name...
Get in the CAR!
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
'Tis the season, convict.
You gotta be kidding me.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
No gun.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
No, you're not.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No way.
Six men means six guns.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
No.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
NO.
You need six.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
What's the code?
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Start singing.
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
No, Gabriel... no...
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
NO!
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nnn... nothing...
What'd you tell that casino manager?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
...never... tried...
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
Don't tip.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
I'm gonna need some money.
You got one hour.
Get out.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Do I get a country-western name?
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
At least gimme video poker.
You do.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Put it on.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
Might as well be.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
More than you know.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Why not.
They won't recognize me.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
So what the hell good are you...
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
And I worked there. For a year.
We walked the place for a week.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
What the fuck are you talking about.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
I did.
I said, who the hell made the map?
What?
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
Hell. Ten?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
Hey, it's... been two years --
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
Christmas... Eve...
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Five million?
The hell you don't.
I don't know.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Hey.
You knew the place --
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
No. It's her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Her brother.
What's her greatest fear?
A station wagon in Canada.
Be more specific.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
What college.
What'd they call her in college?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in high school?
Samantha.
What's her middle name?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What?
Where's she work?
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
I had better sex in prison.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
Wish I had a brother like you.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
She says a lot of things.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
I never worked at no casino.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Yes!
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
But you were saying you were...
I shared his cell!
You're not Nick Mason...
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
You what...
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Put him in the truck.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Who are you now.
The hell I can't.
No, you can't --
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
You... you don't know me --
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Where the HELL did he go?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
And where they hide the real money.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Leave the tree.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Take 'em.
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
GO!!!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
OPEN IT!!!
I can't go back to Vegas...
He's not Nick Mason...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
...so where is he?
I don't steal any --
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
What... Powwow...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I don't know... what you're...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
Show's over.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Mr. Bangs.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
We're aware of your position.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
What?
What about the Powwow Safe?
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
The Powwow Safe?
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
That motherfucker --
Acid-chewer.
Cancer-sucker.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
My what?!
How long ago was your makeover?
Five years. Since it opened.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Fuckin' freezing.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
I promise you, I didn't know!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Merlin, I didn't know --
You knew there were guns in here!
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Where the hell's Gabriel?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
What about the money?
How do we do that?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we take them out?
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
What the hell was that about --
Not with you.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
You want that for here or to go?
Hi, Nick.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Oh, man --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
Monsters in the gelatin...
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
You gave them me.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Do what?
How'd you know I'd do it.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
And you set me up.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
She set them up. All of them.
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
NICK!!!
...for Christmas...
NO!!!
...be with her...
YOU TELL HER!
Tell Ashley... I...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
No, man! No, no, no!
Ash... Ashley...
GUARD!!!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Jesus, Rudy --
GUARD!!!
Alamo...
GUARD! GUARD!
Standing right here, man!
Don't move, Rudy!
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Rudy, don't move --
Good for you. Protein.
Just a roach, Zook.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
What, working security?
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Aw, Rudy.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Thought you hate your old man.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Oh.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
She's using a new perfume.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
I'm just talking.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
I'm just saying.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
And some pecan pie.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
What?
Hot chocolate.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Not yet.
Three days, man.
Ain't there yet.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Hell you haven't.
Haven't thought about it.
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
There is no other table --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I'm ninety-two years old --
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
What? No...
Switch seats with me.
You're hitting for MY cards!
But... I had a five...
POP! That was My card!
Well...sorry...
That was my king!
I... sorry, Mister...
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Without having them hit the alarms.
They changed the layout.
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Since when? What the hell is this room?
That's what it looks like!
Who the hell made this map.
Start talkin
I'M NOT NICK!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
Yes.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Now where were we?
Alone at last.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
I don't wanna lift crates.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Seymour Scagnetti.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
You fuckin' wish.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
That I should've picked you up?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Fine, now.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
How do you know all this?
The motherfucker killed Vic.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Was he all pissed off?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
Where was she from, Compton?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Elois?
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Who?
I'll call somebody.
You ain't dying, he is.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
We can work this out, can't we?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
What?
Daddy, did ya see that?
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Pam Grier.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
I don't know, but somebody did.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Bullshit.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
What? Nobody set anybody up.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Tell me more about Cabot.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
I can do that.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
But what is this?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
What?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
What's this?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
Didja use the commode story?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
The Brewers.
What about?
A little.
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
Did the two of you talk?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
How can you tell?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Yeah.
Who, Mr. White?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
...What bar?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Just hold on buddy boy.
What? Snap out of it!
I'm sorry.
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Mr. Brown?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
You can do some crazy things with it.
Jesus Christ!
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
What for?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
How is he?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Who's your parole officer?
Take a seat.
Sure.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
It's a change.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Wong?
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Dead as Dillinger.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Don't ask me that.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
That's your proof?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Like hell I am.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
What's the cut, poppa?
No, they're not.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
How many employees?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
What for?
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
What's she doin' now?
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
Sorry, it's my book now.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Who gives a damn?
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
You gonna put it away?
Give me my book.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
What do you care?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Give me this fucking thing.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
What's that?
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Aren't you?
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
Nope.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
He don't believe in it.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
He don't tip.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Mr. Pink.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
I do.  How do I look?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Freddy Newendyke.
Your name's Freddy something.
You do?
I know.
I don't like alarms.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
You didn't ask.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Nice Guy Eddie.
For what, the cops?
It's a surprise.
Why?
Down to my car.
Follow you where?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
What're you talkin' about?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What's this guy's problem?
We think we got a rat in the house.
So, talk.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
What happened?
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Lie back down, and try to -
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
It's not good...
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Joe.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Correct.
I'm okay.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
No, I'm not!
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
You don't believe in tipping?
I don't believe in it.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Yeah, those guys too.
Not these guys.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
There's a slight difference.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
This is what he was doin'.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
What are you gonna do about him?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
You takin' his side?
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
We don't think this place is safe.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
That fuckin did it!
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
If we don't, he'll die.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
Of course.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
He asked.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
Why!
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Well, he knows a little about me.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
I don't know anybody.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
We can't take him to a hospital.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
I think he's just passed out.
So what is it?
He ain't dead.
So, is he dead or what?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
For all I know, you're the rat.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
No shit?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
What?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
That was the plan, we meet here.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Where? Are they out in the car?
I got 'em, all right?
Where?
I got the diamonds.
How can you be so sure?
Nope.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
What do you think?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Uh-uh, just cops.
No real people?
A few cops.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
What's wrong with it?
That's not correct.
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Why not?
Want a smoke?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
I'm cool.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
Let's go in the other room...
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
You really think we were set up?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
As opposed to good?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
Dead.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Gun shot.
Fuck all that.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
Look of things, she doesn't.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Nobody. The light was bad.
Who shot who?
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Maybe he did.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
And one of 'em is sick.
It doesn't matter who they are.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Tell them to come on in.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
I haven't got the job yet.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Why?
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
To the other side of the street.
Where you going?
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Thanks for taking over.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Goodbye, Mary.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Maybe they will.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Hurry up.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
It's going to Sonora.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I'm sorry.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
All my clothes --
I suppose that's my fault.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
All right -- it's said!
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
What?
Tell me, darling.
You don't mean that Clay.
Maybe it's better that way.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Why do you think?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Don't you trust me?
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
You're not going out to look for them?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
It's too light yet.
Are we leaving?
That's fine.
He knows his alphabet.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Will she be dark or fair?
But the rest is right.
I'll make the soap myself.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
You should know. She's in your dream.
The who?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Thanks.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I suppose it is.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I hope so, too.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
Coffee?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
We can't stay here!
Hold on.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
So that was why she tried to run away.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
His letters will keep.
They're stragglin'.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
He's learning his letters.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Like what?
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Yeah.
There's a nice boy.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Where do you keep the can opener?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
But you eat, don't you?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
So am I.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
And this is Helen Carter.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
What's the matter with her?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Our kind of women?
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
You can stay here if you like.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You can't leave us here.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Just about.
As far as -- Sonora?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
And this is Helen Carter.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
This must have been in the family a long time.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
What's the matter with her?
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Anybody hurt?
Hello, Miss Wells.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
So did I. They were in it.
I found their surrey --
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
No they won't.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
I can't --
How's that?
Which ranch?
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I -- lost something.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
You'll live.
Kind of sore.
How's that?
I just wondered. Let's go.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Is that the only reason you came back?
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
What did you come back for?
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Half of them are mine.
You want to split up? --
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
I don't care what she asked you.
You know what she asked me?
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Go on, hit me.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You better start.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
There's only two of them now.
Finished, son?
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Yeah, it does.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
I won't again.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Can I have my gun back?
That's right, Steve.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Good thing you didn't.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
How'd you happen to miss?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Swimming.
Where'd they go?
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
I've got eleven horses.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Lednov.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Why?
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
And meet him there.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
All right. I'll tell you.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
At the ranch maybe?
Yes.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
In a fight?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
What was he in jail for?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
Nice.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
I don't want to run short.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
Like what?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
A man I used to know.
Who's Lednov?
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
That's right.
A little hot.
How does she draw?
What's there to be fair about?
You're not bein' quite fair.
Nobody asked you to.
I can't take her with me.
All right, you didn't know.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
What's there to be fair about?
You're not bein' quite fair.
Nobody asked you to.
I can't take her with me.
All right, you didn't know.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Yeah, how did you know?
Three men on matched roans?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
That's a good girl.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
What's botherin' you, anyway?
I said I didn't care.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
I don't care.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Go away -- please.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Stop it -- stop it.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
But I want to stay.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
It isn't that --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Then why stay in the hills.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I like it.
That sure smells good.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
What is it?
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
That something I shouldn't see?
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
You got no business snoopin' around --
They went on like I told you.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Go ahead.
Suppose I take a look.
Yeah.
And you're all alone.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
There aren't any women here.
Even women?
Yes, people make me restless.
What's the matter -- restless?
Well, say it.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
I don't like to see you go.
Goodbye and thanks.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
They shouldn't have done that.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Depends on how good you drive.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
I don't care what he thinks.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
That's it then.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
We might as well start a fire.
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
What's the use.
Go on. Have another try at him.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Maybe I better start working on him.
How many ways can a man say no.
You're not giving up?
What are you waiting for? Do something.
He certainly could. About a month.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
We don't want to go there.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
There's still tomorrow morning.
And we're running out of that.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Now where's she goin'? --
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
Maybe in Sonora.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
I don't know -- I don't know.
How far up the trail?
Up the trail.
Where is he?
Clay Phillips.
Stop it --
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Who brought you here?
Everybody knows --
How do you know who we are?
Yeah, we sure have.
We got company. Female company.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I said let's go.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Because there's a man I want to see.
What for?
We got to get movin'.
Lookin' around.
What are you doin' --
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Put on another one.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
If you need me, I'll be --
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Goodnight.
Steve --
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Thanks, Steve.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Let me do that.
Oh, sure.
She was only teasin'.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
But you're his brother.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
I was doin' both. Here.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Sure.
And you've got me all figured out?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Well, Steve?
I feel good anyways.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Would they be good to eat?
How about California?
No.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
What do they look like?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
And that's tough, isn't it?
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Then I know my alphabet.
That's the end of the line.
What comes after Z?
No. We're not stayin' --
Aren't we stayin'?
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Gee, I can't.
Good night, Steve.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
You're so nice.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Maybe I could start you out.
I sure would.
Would you like to learn them?
Don't you even know your letters?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Alex, what are you doing?
No, I won't let you do it.
Ha! Right bitch!
I think he wants me.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Wife?!
I found a picture of his wife.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Are you okay?
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
That's it.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Me, too. 101?
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Do I know you?
Hey, Brenda.
Would you die already?!
My favorite memory was when we --
Never happened!
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Cindy, what's going on?
Okay.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Hey, I have an idea...
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
It's coming!
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Oh my God! We're dead!
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Help!
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Ouch!!
Psychology.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Thanks.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Really? That's amazing.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Okay.
Ray, run faster.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Where's Shorty?
He's so brave.
He's right. I should go first.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
You sure?
No, stay.
So, I guess I can go now.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Shhh... It's okay.
Hello Ray.
Hello Brenda.
Hot dogs.
I don't care. You pick.
What should we get?
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Hey, look out, a bee!
Let's get a hot dog.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Then what are we going to do?
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Oh.
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Cindy, let me...
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Better try a little higher.
No. Keep rubbing.
Feel that?
No. Try a little higher.
Can you feel that?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Shit!
He's here.
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
What about you, Buddy?
Huh?
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Great!!!
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
I was thinking the same thing.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Yes...
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Hugh Kane.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Let's get outta here.
It looks like the furnace.
Where the hell are we?
Alright!
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Shhh!
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Buddy...
Okay.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Open chest!!!
Hi Buddy.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Yeah.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
I meant you're into ghosts.
No. I never date outside my race.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Hey, you left your book back there.
That means more screen time for us.
But he'll kill her!
Let her go, Cin.
She killed herself a week before he died.
So, whatever happened to her?
Okay, I get the point.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
What, you think I did this to myself?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
I think so.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Where's Shorty?
Right behind you.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
How about these buns?
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Oh, right.
It's the sequel.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's okay.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Yes!!!!
Noooo!!!
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
This can't be happening?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Both of them?
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
It was you...
Made you say it!
Stop! --
Not in a thousand years.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Stop touching his brain!
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Hanson, please.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
I'm Cindy.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Alright, let's take a vote...
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
I'll go.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
We have to destroy him.
What are we gonna do?
Quick, everyone to the lab.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Just wait, you'll see.
What the hell are you doing?
I don't need your help.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry.
No, my friends are right here!
My child you are the only survivor.
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
We? What do you mean... we?
Yes, we made it!
My child, you're alive!
Father!
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
Are you?
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
Uh, uh.
Did you do that?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Hey, I got an idea.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Aww, the little bird died.
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Am I cool now?
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Oh.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Huh?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
You could use the grade, huh?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Don't touch me!!
Saw who?!
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Who?
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I don't like this, this...
I wouldn't go that far.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Got a problem with that?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
What are you getting at, Professor?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Theo, did you see the animal?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
I got it!
Got my camera right here.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
The keys. She took the keys.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
I can do it myself.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
That's why we came here, remember?
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
What?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
What is it, Dwight?
Professor, we need to talk.
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
What the hell?!
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
The image there.
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Professor, I think you should see this.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
My God! Is she dead?
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
That one.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Even in the bathroom?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Would you please focus?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Professor!
Right. What about condoms?
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
In about fifteen minutes.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
What's this?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Any of them hot?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Are these all the subjects?
Here you go, Professor.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Let me help you.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Let me see the files.
I finished all the interviews.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
She's right. We should stick together.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
That's right.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Just a little Rogaine.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Of course. So sexy.
And sexy.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
You do.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
Just a little experiment.
What are you working on?
Hi.
Hello Dwight.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Yours, or the turkeys?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
Thanks, handyman.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
I guess so.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Alright, go to the belt store...
You're not wearing a belt.
Okay, give me my belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
My help?
Alright... I might need your help.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
You never could feel your legs.
Second best.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
How is she?
It's okay. I understand.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
I'm so glad you're here.
Father, come in, please.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
No, I'm fine.
Father, I think you should rest.
My holy water.
No thanks.
What she said about your mother?
What?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Because she will lie?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Then let us prepare.
Yes.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Father, are you okay?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Would you like to see the girl?
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Father.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
This part removes the sense of humor.
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Dog, you look hot.
Yo son, check this out.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Don't worry, I got your back.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
Get out?! What does it say?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
It says, "Ray."
What does it say?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
I woke up naked, too.
No more violence... No more violence...
Bring her home... I guess.
No!  It wasn't like gore movies at all!  IT WAS REAL!
Is MOM... in there?
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
She wouldn't...
You don't think...
0h, shit!
Mother? 
Mrs. Sutphin?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
What a bitch!
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
What happened?
Did you hear?
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Oh, boy! 
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hi, Mom.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
BLOOD FEAST!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
MURDERED?!!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
You said you hated him.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Jeeezzz!
Hi!
He's really cute!
Here we go again.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
No comment!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
Carl's a jerk!
Is there a killer loose?
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
I certainly did not.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Always the dentist.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Because it's the rules!
Why?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sorry, ma'am.
This is so silly. 
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
But, Chip...
In here, Mom...
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
You scared me.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
CHIP!!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
I'm so happy I could shit.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Looks good, Mom!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Oh Mom...
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
But Mom, the video's not over.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Let me see!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Thanks, Mom.
Chip, honey?
She sure can pick 'em!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
You mean for TV or print?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
That's right.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Your mom killed my brother!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Bird books mostly...
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Detectives, what is this about?
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Hi, Hank.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
He goes to college with me!
Oh, honey!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooohhhh!
Don't wake the kids...
Oooohhhh.
Shhhh..
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You bring me such peace...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
I love that you're my wife.
We can be real quiet...
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Don't I get a kiss?
Goodnight, honey.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Chip, your ride is here.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
No woman would!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
That's nice.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
...People who don't mind their own business.
"P" as in...
Yes, I did.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
What a mess.
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
I know Dottie!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Objection! Argumentative!
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
I certainly did.
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
So you admit you just lied?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you do drink?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
I certainly was not!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
No, I don't.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
I didn't do it!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
What did you just say?
Are those pussy-willows?
It's not fair!!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
COCKSUCKER! 
MOTHERFUCKER!!
GODDAMN YOU!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Who is this?
I beg your pardon?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
FUCK YOU! 
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
You bitch!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Hello.
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Yes, I was.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Marvin A. Pickles.
State your name, please.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
You got your wish.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
It's him!
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
We all have bad nights. 
He killed people, Mom.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
And who may I ask is Carl?
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
It's sugarless.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
I do, please.
Who wants fruit salad?
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Yes... but... I didn't...
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Yes, but I lent it...
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
...Browsing.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Beverly, are you alright?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Certainly not!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
There is one big problem though.
He's a good boy.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Bon Appetit!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Right here!
Mrs... Sutphin?
Now, here's a babe!
Murder, honey.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Yes you are.
Are we leaving?
You forgot something...
Man, that one made me puke!
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
What is it, Betty?
How to send a bill!!
What's he know?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What was that?
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
I'll take this instead.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Yeah - sure.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Sure I do.
You know who I am, August?
Listen 
You could go and open the door.
We can't stand here all night.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
No.
Let's get out of here.
Yes.
You scared?
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Which room is it?
I don't like this.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
Can we go there now?
You can't tell.
You think my sister is there?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Where?
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
You can?
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
No.
Drink.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
When I wanted to.
No.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
Yes, I understand.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Yes.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Thank you.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
What circumstances?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
But tell me --
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
About forty-five dollars.
How much have you got?
I haven't got that much in cash.
She can only use cash.
I'll give you a check.
She could use a hundred dollars.
How much does she want?
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
What sort of danger?
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
What is it?
I ought to know.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Thank you.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
I guess most people are.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
She's a pretty good sort.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Redi's all right.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
But I like teaching school.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
I'll try there.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
"The Dante?"
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
I can't understand it at all.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Hello, Frances.
Why, Mary --
Yes.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
She showed me a drawing.
What did she want to know?
No. She asked about the trademark.
And that was all?
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Nothing.
What were you talking about?
I did her hair.
What did she want?
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I know  I shouldn't have told you
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
Yes.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Good night.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
We've tried so long to find her.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
What things? Why?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
Who the devil is he?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
 What have you done about Irving August?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
What brought you down here, Greg?
Yes.
The people at the restaurant?
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
I'd like that.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
A job?
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
But you have treated me that way.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
Drink your milk.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
But you do believe me?
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
Goodnight, Mary.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Good.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Weren't you afraid?
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Why?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
Not from me.
She'll have to know some time.
That you love Mary.
Let her know what?
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
What's that?
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Could you find him?
We could tell him.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
I don't know.
Do you think he knows about this?
Well, that's illuminating.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Well?
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm not joking.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
I'm going to find your sister.
You will die.
I don't know.
And then?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Why wait?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
I'm afraid.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
No!
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Who are you?
Yes.
You'll be all right?
I won't get lonely.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
Please, Jacqueline.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you - you're off to work.
I understand.
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
I keep telling myself that.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
They may have been friends of hers.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
What's wrong, Mary?
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
And you believe that?
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
I have to go -
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it  to know me better.
But it's a small room, Jason.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
I can imagine.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
Devil worshippers!
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I'm at sea, Jason.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I don't know.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I don't think that's so revealing.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
But you're always at the library.
I have been at the library.
I have something even better.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
And you knew he'd be here.
Yes.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Were you going to make a suggestion?
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
Jason, my pet 
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Well, since, you're over twenty one
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
It's here, too.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
And the other was Judd?
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
What?
I'd like that.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
It might have.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
Perhaps
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Perhaps.
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
I think it's time.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Tell me what?
Yes. When I tell you.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I'd forgotten.
Wait - there is that other favor.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
I should like people to read what I've written.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Uhhuh.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?
I've lost my knack.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
What was she to you?
She was my patient.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
But why come to me?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
What a peculiar question.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I don't know.
Would they hurt her?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
Cloven hoof?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
You know where she is?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
Dr. Judd?
No, she's with her sister,
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
I'm very, very serious.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I never thought you did.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
Is it about Jacqueline?
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
Unless what?
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
I was a great dancer...
A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
But you would like to know where she is?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
It seems right to us.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
I don't believe it.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
Why?
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I'll be out in a minute.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Yes.
That's too bad.
I'm afraid not.
Thank you, my dear.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
I didn't know.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I'm afraid not.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
But she was here?
She's not been here for a long time.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Of course.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
That makes it all the more difficult 
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
What did he say?
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Please.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
She's very beautiful.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Yes?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
When?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
What?
Because I have something very important to do.
Why
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
But he also wrote --
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
It won't hurt.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Graham...
No.
I want to touch you.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
You're not answering me.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
Why are you ashamed?
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Come on!!
I don't care.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I can't tell you like this.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Because.
Why not?
Don't do that.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't know.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Possibly.
Like maybe a big part?
Yes.
But that was part of it?
Not entirely.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
I don't know. Possibly.
But you're planning to be?
No.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Yes.
Who? Elizabeth?
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But I don't understand --
I've told you.
Why not?
I can't.
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
That's very flattering.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But if you were?
I'm not in love with you.
If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not planning on it.
You're really never going to make love again?
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
God, I m so mad at him!!
No, you're not.
I'm babbling.
Interesting analogy.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
And you feel the same way with John?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Subtlety?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Don't you get lonely?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
And now you can?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
How come?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
So you lied to her?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
What was the problem?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Her name was Elizabeth.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
Yes.
So you have had sex.
That's correct.
You said you weren't always impotent.
Can't.
Can't or won't?
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Why not?
No.
On tape?
No.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Yes.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Have you fantasized about me?
Yes.
About me?
I fantasized about you.
About who?
Yes.
So you do fantasize?
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
Why?
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
No.
Do you want me to stop?
I guess not.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes, I have. I will.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Yes.
Did you have sex before you were married?
Absolutely not.
Is he going to see this?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Does he go down on you?
Sometimes. Afterward.
Yes.
When we're making love?
Do you talk to him?
You are married, correct?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Tell me your name.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Tell me your name.
Yes.
It won't. Are you ready?
What will you do when the money runs out?
I have money.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Then do it.
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
What do you have to do to get ready?
That's a good question.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What difference does it make why I do it?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Don't you want to make one?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Why not?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Why didn't you tell me?
She said it on her tape.
How did you know?
Yes.
You know?
I know.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
I know.
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Yes, I do.
Maybe you want to go.
This is just... so...
I'm sorry this came up.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
To you?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
And they just answer them?
Yes.
You just ask them questions?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Like what?
Everything about sex.
What about sex?
Yes.
About sex?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
What... what are these interviews about?
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
Why not?
No.
Can we look at one?
Yes.
All of these are interviews?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
Not really.
You went out with her?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna?
Who's Donna?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
What kind of personal project?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
I can see that. What are they?
Videotapes.
What are these?
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Are you in the middle of something?
Ann. Hello.
Hi!
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Basically, yes.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Of course not.
You had sex with you therapist?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
So you don't believe in therapy?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Aren't you?
You're in therapy?
My therapist said that --
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
What?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Does it bother you?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
You are?
Impotent.
You're what?
Agreed.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Do you want me to?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Why is that?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Do you want them?
Kids? What about them?
So what about kids?
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
I feel like they do.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
How do you mean?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Okay, I will!!
No.
Would you mind?
Lawyers.
What's the first?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Who's Elizabeth?
I don't know.
Younger.
Sister older or younger?
Mother, father, sister.
Thank you.
This food is excellent.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
Why'd you drop out?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Nine years?
Nine years.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
You mean like "time flies"?
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Oh, uh-huh.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
...free-lance. You know.
Well... well, the clich about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
You play an instrument?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
No, not really.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Well...
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
No, I think you look... fine.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Graham is an unusual name.
Curious.
No. Why?
Yes.
Television?
Have you ever been on television?
Oh.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Do you have other things?
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Oh. Well, please sit down.
False alarm.
That was quick.
Graham Dalton.
Yes?
Ann?
Yes.
God damn you!!
You bitch. I knew it.
I have thought about it, yes.
Not very often.
You son of a bitch!!
He does.
Bastard...
Yes.
Goddam right.
Yes!
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Where did you go when you left here?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Why?
I want out of this marriage.
What?
I want out of this marriage.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
I know.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Loud.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
You've made your point.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Always the lawyer.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Why don't I believe you?
I'm not either!!
But I'm not.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Well, are you?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Are you having an affair?
Something wrong?
I ate by myself.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Yes. I just got busy.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
Mmmmm...
John?
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
You did that?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
Why?
I hate my sister.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Yes.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Not really.
Do you want to leave therapy?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I guess.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
What brought this on?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
What do you mean, like physically?
Did you find him attractive?
No, he left last week.
Is he still at your house?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
What visitor?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, I haven't.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Radon leakage?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
I take it you've never masturbated?
God, no.
Did you masturbate?
What do you mean?
Did you do anything?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
When did you begin having this feeling?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Yeah, I know.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
What upsets you about that?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Yeah, so?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
What do you mean?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
No, I didn't.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
I get real busy between two and four.
No.
Do you have my work number?
Well. I can't stay.
Thank you.
Thirty-two dollars.
So what's my share of the dress?
Hold on.
I was just trying to --
It does not.
It looks like a tablecloth.
It's a sun dress.
What is it?
Here it is.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
I don't want to discuss it.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
You are in serious trouble.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I feel like I do.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
You couldn't do it, period.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
Why?
I can't believe you did that!!
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
You are in trouble.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
You touched him?
No, but I did.
Did he touch you?
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
You don't know that for sure.
He wouldn't do that.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I wanted him to see me.
But why did you want to?
Because I wanted to.
Why did you do that?
What!?
Cynthia!
Yes, I did.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Apparently.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Questions about sex.
What kinds of questions?
He just asked me questions.
I don't know.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, what, then?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, it's nothing like that.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No!
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, why?
Because I never got around to it.
Why not?
No, I didn't.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Fine.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
I just thought it might --
Will you stop? Jesus.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
What's wrong with that?
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Lose something?
And... do whatever it is you do.
And what?
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Let me talk to him first.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
What are you talking about?
But he won't.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
He doesn't have a phone.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
I have a pretty good idea.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
I say it because it's descriptive.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
What?
Do you have to say that?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Why, so you can go after him?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
So will you, someday.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
It was busy.
There's a phone here.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
No, I touched me.
Did you take your clothes off?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
No.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Cynthia, I don't know.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I would.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
No.
So make an exception.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I can't talk you into it?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
No? Not even one more?
No.
I'd like to make another tape.
Okay.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Hi.
Hello.
He doesn't have to tell me.
Is that what he tells you?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Different.
Prettier than Ann?
Yes.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.
Do you like the way I look?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Then what happened?
He said that my hand felt good.
What did he say?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Were you disappointed?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Very much live.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
When I was fourteen.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Just a moment.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Whichever you prefer.
Do I sit or stand?
No.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
How long will it take?
Yes.
And you ask questions, right?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
How do we start?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Would anybody else see the tape?
Yes.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
That's all.
And that's all?
I just want to ask you questions.
You just want to ask me questions?
Nothing.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
About what?
Talking.
Doing what?
Why don't you let me tape you?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Not exactly.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
What do you get?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Spooked.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
How did you find me?
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She still is.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
I just want to know why you're here.
You want me to leave?
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
The extrovert.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
Do I know you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Who are you?
No, John, things are getting real simple.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I know. Will you please leave now?
God, you... you're mean.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Graham.
Who?
Did he put you up to this?
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
How about straightening up the living room?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
What do you mean?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
You trust him.
It won't. I trust him.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
No.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
Hung up.
I just... Ann is very...
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Why not?
I wish you hadn't done that.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
You told Ann about this?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Right.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
I like the way he dresses.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What's so stupid about it?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Do you want me to stop calling?
I don't think my sister would agree.
Nothing wrong with trying.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Cynthia. John.
Hello.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Right now.
When?
I want to see you.
John Millaney.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You know what I mean.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Not today. I've got other plans.
Cynthia. John.
Hello.
In here!!
John?
You are scum. I'll be there.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Hello.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
You're intrigued?
I'm intrigued.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Maybe.
Afraid of getting caught?
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Could be risky.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
I did.
Who said I was jealous?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Why?
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Right.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
I've got to get back to the office.
How about for five hundred?
Not for three-fifty.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Plus first and last month deposit.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Student?
It'll just be me.
Plenty of room for two people.
Shut up!!!
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Goddamit...
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
My keys?
Give me your keys.
No.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
No.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
No.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
God, you need help.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
So is my wife, asshole!!
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
What tapes?
Where are the tapes, Graham?
Hi, John.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
What do you mean?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
She held up very well.
Really. How'd it go?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
You were prying before?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
You have family here also?
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
A bonfire, probably.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
Everybody has a past.
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Yes?
Mr. Millaney?
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
One moment.
John Millaney.
May I ask who's calling?
Brian Kirkland, please.
IBM.
All right, jesus.
He said immediately.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Yeah.
Mr. Millaney?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
Was he nice to you?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Hi. Want a drink?
Hi.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
He'll be really mad.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Jesus!
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
He sounded fine.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
I see. Then what brought you up here?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
You knew these people?
No, nothing.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Yes.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Sure.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Medical clinic?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Down to the incinerator.
But where are you going?
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Where is he now? Do you know?
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
OK. But late.
Well? Supper at my place?
No. I don't think so.
Anything wrong?
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
No. Dotty's the last.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Another kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
Kiss, kiss?
Do I get a kiss?
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Nick, you're so strange...
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
You say something?
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Can I call you at the office?
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Yes? Who is there?
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
We live in 703.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
What happened?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Gonna cut me open?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
That's the one.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Just breathe normally.
Want me to breathe deeply?
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
Yeah? What do I do then?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Huh?
He didn't make it.
Lemme clarify for you.
I don't get it.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
No? How come?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Yes?
That you, Rog?
Yes?
OK. I'll think about it.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
Who was she?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
I don't get it.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
It's crazy.
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
Did I say anything?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
So who changes?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.

What?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
What's cookin', Bert?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
Time to check with Flavors.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Fools!
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
A wreck.
How's Brad?
Of course.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
You bet, Bert.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
Infantile regression.
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
About Brad's family?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
SIN-I-FUL
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
But...how?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
When do I get to see Brad?
Home?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
I've caught it once or twice.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I know, I know, it's just...
He needs help.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Introduce yourselves.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
So it seems.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Why Janet?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
How did you come by this scenario?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Who trusts experts?
We're the experts.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
SOLD??!!
Dentonvale has been sold.
SPONSOR!!!
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
He was a President.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
In a little masquerade?
Indulge?
Care to indulge?
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Are you spoken for this evening?
Yes, Betty.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
...closed?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
McKinley?...McKinley?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Everything's free there.
A free thinker.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
In a way...
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
You too, Betty!
Shove it, Ralph!
I'll leave you young things to it.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY

But I don't need treadment.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
I'm not going, Janet.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
I don't want to get up there.
That's us.

Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
I'd forgotten.
He was adopted you know.
Mental instability?

And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Absolutely correct.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Sure thing.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Who?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
What do you mean?
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
That doesn't make sense.
But they only think they're happy.
Of course.
Could I do that later?
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
You're practically naked!
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Why?
You shouldn't have said that.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Poor Brad.
What show?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
It's...
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
I know.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?

OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
BRAD!
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Brad!
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
. . .For his own good.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Do you really think so?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
I want to see Brad.
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
Me?
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I'm...happy.
No...couldn't I do this later?
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
No!  He's never done that before.

In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
This could be worse than the old series.
SIN-I-FUL

THAT MINIMAL
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
WHAT A JOKE...
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'RE NO GOOD
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
That's an extremely negative response.
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
What does he know about it?
Our field.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Our speciality.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Surely.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
We love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Isn't she lovely?
We're not confused.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
No.
And none of them worked?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
The fuck was that?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
Bye.
I love you.
Bye.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Why are you being so defensive?
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
So what's up?
Good. That's good.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
You guys having fun?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
It'll just take a second.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
So I guess that's it.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Yeah, I'm here.
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Huh.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
And?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
How's the trip?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Miles.
I'm good.
You okay, Miles?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
Say, is Maya working?
You got it.
Bottle.
Glass or bottle?
Highliner.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
How's it hanging, Miles?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
What do you think?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
What are you pouring tonight?
My condolences.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Gary.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Two years ago, buddy.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Is it chicken?
They're just leftovers.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
They're from both of us.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
I can explain.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Hi.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
What happened to you guys?
Me too.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Not so bad yourself.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Good. How're you?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
I know. I might need to be spanked.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Nice.
Stephanie.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
That's what people say.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Well, in that case...
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
You are not.
I am one of those guys.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Anything I'd know?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
No, I'm an actor.
Are you a writer too?
That's on us.
Highliner, please.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Hiya.
You were wearing your belt.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Back at you.
Love you, man.
Yeah.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Why don't you come in?
Well. That about does it.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Whatever. Sorry.
You broke some.
You need a new car anyway.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Look at this!
I'll pay for it.
What the fuck!
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
What's wrong?
I feel like driving.
I'm fine. You rest.
Come on, let me drive.
You're so negative.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
No, I'm okay.
Want me to drive?
Quite a week.
Yep. Quite a day.
That was quite a day yesterday.
Hrnrnrn?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Hold on.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Me?
The plan is... you go.
So what's the plan?
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Yeah.
She tell you she was married?
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Please, Miles, please.
No way. No way.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
What?
We gotta go back.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
What?
Fucking chick's married.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Uh-huh.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
What's that?
You know what I'm thinking?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's it look like to you?
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Huh. Let me think.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Yeah.
That's thoughtful.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Well?
Keep it elevated.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Thanks.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
What's up?
Let me use your phone.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I say we check it out. You never know.
I don't have to.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Are they too sporty?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Do you like them?
I know what you need.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Let's leave it alone.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
It's private.
What?
No.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Put me down, Jack.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Huh.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
I SAID OKAY?
You have to tell me --
I said okay?
What exactly are we going to do?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
What's happening?
We're on.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
Slaughterhouse.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
With Maya.
Is what the money thing?
Is it the money thing?
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
I don't want to talk about it.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Throw me his ball.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Fucker hit into us.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
What is it?
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Shut up.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Huh.
Obsessively.
Been checking your messages?
Could be anything.
What do you think's going on?
Nope.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
You're an asshole.
Nice shot.
Thanks, Jack.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Oh yeah. Sure.
Can you give me some room here?
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Nope.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Yeah.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
That was three years ago after that first party!
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
What? Of course I like Christine.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Understanding of what?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Deep.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
What?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Besides what?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Does she know about Saturday?
With this chick.
What?
What the fuck are you doing?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Where is Stephanie?
What're you drinking?
Yep.
Hey, there you are.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
What'd Christine say?
Okay! Jesus!
Right now.
I will.  See ya!
You should call her.
Yeah. Okay.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Later.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Count me out.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
We were supposed to play golf.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Shut up. Shut your face.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Did you drink and dial?
Bathroom.
Where were you?
I'm fine!
Pull yourself together, man.
Okay! Fuck!
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Aye-aye, captain.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
So what should I wear?
Nah. I want to watch this.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Well, she is cute.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
With Maya?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
What?
We're on.
You have the keys.
Get the trunk.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
I'm a quick learner.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
What do you think?
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
I want to go home now.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
About a month ago. Six weeks.
She what?  When?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Miles.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Beautiful.
Nice, huh?
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
So what's the plan today?
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Fuck you.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Have you no shame?
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Shut up.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
How do you know?
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
She works for tips!
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Perfect.
And she likes Pinot.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
She is very hot.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
You know that chick?
Sure I know Maya.
You know her?
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Pour us a couple.
Yeah. Tight.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Then it's a good thing.
It does. Feels right.
If that's what feels right.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Uh-huh.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
So you're going to stop acting?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Whoa.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
We should have driven.
It's not even a mile.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Just a minute!
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Want some?
Are you chewing gum?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
How would you rate this one?
Now.
When do we get to drink it?
That's what you do with every one.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
What do you smell?
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Huh.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
What color is it supposed to be?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
This is rose, right?
Now we're talking.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
I owe her a call anyway.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Let me call Christine.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
And get your bone smooched.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
You still seeing that shrink?
I'm working on it.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
I'd rather have a knife.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
That's your problem, Miles.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
That's a good age.
Um... seventy... something.
How old's she going to be?
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
What?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Oh yeah. Much better.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
And?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Sure is tasty.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Just tell me.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Oh, that's tasty.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Yeah.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Yeah, Conundrum.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
You said you had it all lined up.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
I can't help the traffic.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Yeah.
Oh, Maya. No.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
I'm sure he believed every word.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Maya.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Were you ever going to say anything?
What rehearsal dinner?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Okay.
About two-thirty.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
You too.
Well, nice to see you now.
I had class.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Goodnight, Miles.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Okay. See you around.
Good. So did I.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Got it.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Yeah.
Bathroom over there?
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah? Like what?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
What about me?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Sure.
Can I ask you a personal question?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Well...
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
A paper?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Yeah. Thanks.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Oh. You mean... today?
"The Day After Yesterday."
What's the title?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
So what's your novel about?
Yeah. Definitely.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, same here.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
You got kids?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
What was the bottle that did it?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
How long have you been into wine?
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Yeah, I know.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
She got anything good?
Hey.
Hi.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Are you all right?
That's what I'm having.
I'm having the salmon.
I know. I love that.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Twelve months in oak.
Nice. Very nice.
Try it.
Oh yeah? How is it?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
What are you drinking?
See you.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
The Windmill.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Good for you.
I finished it.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Sure.
You want to join us?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Maya, how are you?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Yeah.
See you over there, Miles.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
I'm pregnant.
You quit drinking?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
I guess.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
I am.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
So what's happening with your book?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
So how're you doing?
That's great.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That was big of him.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Ken.
Ken.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Hello?
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Where are you?
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Miles?
Victoria.
Hello?
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
I told you I need a drink.
Sir, what are you doing?
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Good stuff.
Both.
French or American?
About a year.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About four weeks.
How much skin and stem contact?
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Stephanie! Stop!
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Where?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
You golf?
Oops. Sorry.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Huh.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
He had to make a phone call.
Where's Jack?
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
That was fun last night.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Should we get dessert?
Exactement!
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
So what do you think?
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
You talked to Wendy?
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
It was a surprise, Mom.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Don't touch him.
Daddy.
No dad!
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
There's dust in it.
She doesn't answer me either.
No.
Does she ever answer back?
It makes me feel better.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
What are you thinking about?
Right.
Only for pee or poop.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
It tastes old.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
What's the matter?
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
Houdini's sick.
Me too.
I'm scared.
Who said I was going to die?
I don't want you to die.
That's weird.
The same windows.
Dad!
My ballet recital.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I heard them Morgan.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
It tastes funny.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
You don't even know what that word means.
I think it's contaminated.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
I'm here.
...Tell Graham --
...I will.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...I will.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
Good.
I don't feel much.
Does it hurt?
You love walks.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
Hi baby.
Hi sweetie.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Five. The five longest.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Clear for what?
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I see.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
You do?
Don't.
Graham.
Graham.
Don't touch him.
Me too.
That's good enough for me.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Have they said anything about our area?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
No.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
How do they know it's over?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How many died?
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
They're broadcasting...
I'm close.
It's getting stronger.
Me too.
I can feel air.
From what?
They're distracting us?
Got it!
Merrill!
I'm looking!
Merrill --
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
We won't be able to get out of there.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
What are you doing?
He was only a year and half old.
They're right behind the door.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
We have to go in the basement.
This is going to do nothing.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're on the roof.
They already know we're here.
Should we turn off the lights?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Chicken Teriyaki.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Ray Reddy's house.
Where are you going?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
What time is it?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What does it matter then?
Yes.
Do you feel comforted?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
How can you say that?
Yes.
Do you think it's a possibility?
I got him.
Morgan, be careful.
That's right.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
It's noise.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
Pharmacy crowded?
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Yes, it was.
It was very dark.
Yes it was.
It was very dark.
I heard.
I cursed.
You want him coming in the house next time?
No I'm not.
Are you going to do this or what?
Explain noises.
Just make noises then.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
I'm not going to curse.
Curse and stuff.
Explain, act crazy?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Did someone save me?
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
I can't even imagine.
You're scaring your sister.
They'll read our minds!
Don't yell at her!
Stop crying!
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
What about Isabelle?
The family room.
Where are we going to sleep?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Sounds made up.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
They win.
What's two?
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
I just asked his name.
Dad.
Bimboo?
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
That means they're unemployed.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Who wrote this book?
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
They tell you everything in this book.
Oh.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Morgan?
Don't do it.
I'm getting out now.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
We might lose the signal.
It's old Morgan.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
I have some upstairs.
These are D's; I need double A's.
Edgar, come inside.
It needs batteries.
Yes.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
What did you say?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Pinned? What does that mean?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Why not?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Is he okay?
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
And three weeks.
Six months.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
No.
Is anything missing?
No.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
I don't think so.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I would say so.
Okay.  So he was tall?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
Sounds like a virus.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
What was the first thing?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
It's not broken.
There are none.
What about them?
The footprints.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
Sorry.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
What's that?
Don't call me Father.
It's the strangest thing Father.
They'll find a way in.
What book!
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Don't worry.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
They think it might happen all at once.
It's like War of the Worlds.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
You'll lose the signal!
Don't do it!
Yeah.
Is that him?
What do you mean, the horses?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
No money, eh?
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
It was my fault.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Your next water ain't for three days.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
There's nobody coming?
I think we lost 'em.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
The one with the shotgun.
What friend is that?
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
You're in here for winging a guy?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
...And you had to kill him?
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
That's why they got you in jail?
All I did was kiss a girl.
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Forget it.
All right then.  Let's go.
Sounds good.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Did it seem short to you?
I didn't know you were out.
McKendrick.
Emmett.
Right.
Gotta go.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Kate?
Is he alive?
McKendrick's men got him.
Where's Jake?
I almost didn't.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Have to.
You'll never make it.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
I'm sorry.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
That's it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Where are we?
Sure.
...Gotta go...
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Where were you?
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
That I do.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I already did that.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
It's one thing to know it...
You must have known that before you came.
This is a brutal land.
Are you all right?
Yeah... that must have been it.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
That's why I'm here.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Goodbye?
I just came out to say goodbye.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Paden sends his best.
They've been kind to me.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
More than enough.
And they were two of them. Look --
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
And you're not Baxter, either?
My name is Emmett.
You're not Baxter?
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I'll be long gone.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I haven't done anything.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
Ten A.M.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I've got a job.
You might make a farmer yet.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I'll see you around.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
I'm going to California with my brother.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Yeah?
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
I'll be around.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
Where you been?
Anybody got any ideas?
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
All right, you buy me a drink.
You haven't got any money.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
No hard feelings.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
It's not going to be easy.
I understand.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
He is that.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
Which way do you mean?
Doesn't look quite fair.
I expect.
Women?
I expect.
They got a saloon there?
It's a town...
What's Turley like?
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
Going to Turley, was it?
I gotta be going.
And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Where's Turley?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's the pinto going?
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I had to get up anyway.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
No, Leavenworth.
Jefferson City?
Not for five years.
Offend anybody lately?
You got no idea what they were after?
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
That's a lie.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
What about the law?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
You own this land.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Who?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
What happened?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Where is Rae?
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
Daddy?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
What's that?
Because they don't like what I want.
Why?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Believe it.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
And a pretty lady.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Never will again.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Let's get out of here.
New record.
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
All I did was kiss the girl.
Get out of here, Jake.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
Who is he?
He is now.
This a friend of yours?
He'll be here.
Where's your brother?
We wait.
What now?
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
We didn't get that far.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Right!
The other guy drew first.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Really?
You can't do this.
I'm done talking. Get out.
What are you talking about?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
You wanted to see me?
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
Howdy.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
That ain't right.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Is that a fact?
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
What's all this then?
I was afraid of that.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
The jury saw it differently.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
You're kidding.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
We'd rather stay.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Why him?
Because I'm your sister.
Why would they stop you?
What makes you think I could?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What's stopping you?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Why come to me?
Rae, I need help.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, all we got is each other.
It's none of your business.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Who did it?
He was murdered.
Daddy's dead.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Hello, Rae.
Where's Emmett now?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Lucky.
I got there just short of too late.
You don't know?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Because they enjoy it.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Good luck, Mal.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Did you hear his son is still around?
I heard that too.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
What about his brother?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
He must be pretty good.
Good-bye, Paden.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
What's she got to do with it?
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I thought we talked about that.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
So we understand each other?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
What is it you want from me?
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
It is that.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
This is a lot of money.
I took out thirteen dollars.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Luck, I guess.
What brings you into my saloon?
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
I just got to town.
You got a place to stay?
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
You're right.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You've got a legitimate job.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
I've given that up.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Where's the dog?
It's been a while.
I see you're prospering without me.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Hello, Cobb.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I've got a place I can hide her.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I don't want you to get hurt.
How about you?
I'm ready for that.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
What makes you say that?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
What do you mean?
What is it that I can't figure?
He left me.
Where's the dog now?
Give me some of the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
Oh, yeah? How good?
That's the good stuff.
What's this?
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Is this a fair mix?
Here he comes right now.
Who's the owner?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
So-called?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
It's the only place I'm happy.
You like a good saloon?
And I know what I'm talking about.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Paden.
Stella.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Nifty.
I run the place. What can I get you?
You work here?
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
I thought you two would get along.
I wouldn't worry about that.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
That was my plan.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I am telling the truth.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Who?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
Of course.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Good-bye.
I'm glad we talked.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Okay -- for you.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
I'm not --  He's not.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
No... it's life.
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
How much wine have you had?
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
You?
Not if I don't let her.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
I want you back too, Viktor.
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I just read somewhere --
Impossible.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Not quite.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
When is she coming over?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
I can imagine.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
... Simone.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
My two favorite girls.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Excuse me?  Start?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
I do?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Do what?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Thank you.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
No.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Really?
She said you were very beautiful.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
You're so good to protect her like this.
She doesn't want pity.
Viktor, you should have said something.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
-- I can explain.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
-- You can't go in there!
That's true.
Everyone you know is lying.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Soon.  Soon.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
You really think so?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Better late than never.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
I'll walk you out.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Even the fall from the plane.
Even the fall from the plane?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
There isn't one.
What about it?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
I'll send you her resume.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Hair and make-up?
She'll drive herself.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
If it's on the page...
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
"Forever".
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Why not?
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Why not?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
I can't wait to meet her.
Almost right.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Why isn't she with you?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Where is she?
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
The picture's dead.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
You're not renewing my contract.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
Spare me.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
-- It's called a projector.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Please.
The public decides who's on that list.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
-- What's wrong with that?
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Excuse us.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Where are you?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Hello?
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Well, I --
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
So you did meet her?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Because obviously she existed, right?
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Just a minute.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
It was a great show, Dad...
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Mom, do you miss Dad?
I have to talk to her.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Why?
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Please put your clothes on
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Is that a problem?
You're with me to be close to her?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Do what you do to Simone.
What?... What did you say?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
... so much like her?
You look so, so...
Of course.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
And what may I ask brought this on?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
How about the nudity?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
No, I'm okay.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Who are you really?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Simone!
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
I know what you mean.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
Somebody said she was here.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
Is she here?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
How did the wall get there?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
There's... a wall between you --
Why not?
You can't.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Absolutely not!
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Hal, what are you doing?
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
For her?
Body double.
How will you do our love scenes?
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
It was more in passing.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Clyde.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
You never were together, Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Hello, Hal.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
I'm already dead.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
You saw that?
"Straw God" changed my life.
You do?
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
What's that?
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I don't know anything about computers.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
-- Flesh is weak.
I need flesh and --
-- We call them "vactors".
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
Not like this --
I've seen them all before.
You have to see her.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
I'm sorry.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Good for you, Hank.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
I was misquoted.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
You want me to call Security?
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
-- Please, get away from me.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
About you and mom?
Lainey...
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
No, that was me.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
I know.  Thank her for me.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
She did... didn't she?
Why didn't she thank you?
I love you too, daddy.
I love you, Lainey.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Really?  Too bad.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I noticed.
You know me -- married to my work.
I do okay.  How about you?
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Night, Lainey.
Good-night, Daddy.
Precisely.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
One thing bothered me.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Okay, Dad.
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
I read.
How?
I do.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
I know plenty of boys.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Why?
Can't you stop that?
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
She can't watch herself.
Is she here tonight?
You know, I... don't know.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Me too.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
There was no other way.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Not quite how I imagined it --
This week anyhow.
She still with Kent?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Your mother couldn't make it?
Hello, Lainey.
Hi, Dad.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Hello, sweetheart.
Hi, Dad.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
What?!
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
An insanity defence.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
I could get the death penalty.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
This should take care of Mother.
Don't you?
You love her, don't you, Max?
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
She looks a lot like you.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
What now, Sayer?
Er,... good.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
Abduction?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I'm keeping it in trust.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
-- I bet you have.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
The background is.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I know what you're up to.
It's a yacht.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
They are alive, Sayer.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
This is the story.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Do I know you?
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
I don't understand.
It's a hotel.
Is that why she left you?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
We used to.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer...
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
Long live the First Amendment.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
I will when you're finished writing it.
My God, you've got one?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Yes, very.
Dark?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Why?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Is it a jamming device?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
But that's Simone's part.
You could play the lead.
Thank you.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Yes, I'd like that.
Would you like me to read?
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Thank you.  It's not important.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Yes.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Taller?  What?
Taller, Viktor.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
You're in breach.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
What if it catches on fire?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Good.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Let's take it down a notch.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Hi.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
You know what I'm talking about.
The only real truth is in the work.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You did create me.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
I am the death of real.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Maybe he can.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You mean they buy it?
... digitized.
A star is...
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Simone.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Tell me.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
I didn't leave you.
Why did you leave me?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Why, Malcolm?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Are you calling me?
--Do I know you?
--My God.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Wow. They called you their son.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Thanks.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
What?
And you know what else?
Really?
You were great in the play, Cole.
Maybe.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
I definitely won't.
Don't go home, okay?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I wish I were somewhere else.
I guess she did.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
You do?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You believe now?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Just help.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
No.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You really look better.
What happened?
No, we're not.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Yes, I am.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, it did.
Something happened, didn't it?
You believe me, right?
Yes.
Dr. Crowe?
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
You weren't a paper champion.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Don't cry.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
--What?
Don't fail me.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Soon. One week.
When?
I have to.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
I don't know, Cole.
I told you what I want.
I don't know.
What do you want more than anything?
Yes.
Can I ask you then?
Them?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes?
Never mind.
Cats?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
What?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
...No.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
How often do you see them?
They don't know they're dead?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Me too.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Your eyes told me.
What makes you think that?
No gas... Hey, that's good.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
No.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Yes.
Dr. Crowe.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Yes.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
I forgot myself.
I didn't know you were funny.
Who me?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
What?
That isn't magic.
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Something I want?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Upset words.
What kind of words?
Words.
What'd you write?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
She died a long time ago.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Yeah. Sorry.
You said the "s" word.
That I'm a freak.
Know what?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Why?
I don't tell her a thing.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
You hate him?
He hates me.
He your best buddy?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Look over there.
Where should I look then, Cole?
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
You mean aneurysm.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
You want to ask me a question?
I guess they don't.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
How do you draw now?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
If it's okay with you?
I'm going to see you again, right?
That's good.
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
You use needles?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
Congratulations.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Dr. Crowe.
I forgot your name.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
What were they hiding from?
No, just one.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
Cole, please stop.
She wanted me to tell you--
I know.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
What?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Got it.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
You think I'm a freak?
...I don't know.
What are you thinking, Momma?
They talk to you?
They want me to do things for them.
You see ghosts, Cole?
Ghosts.
Dead people?
Dead people.
They?
They scare me too sometimes.
Cole, you're scaring me.
Standing next to my window.
Where is she?
Yes.
You can see her?
Oh my God.
A lady. She died.
They did?
Someone got hurt.
Yeah.
You know that accident up there?
Tell you my secrets.
Communicate?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Maybe.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
So who moved it?
Don't get mad.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
Anything bad about me?
Lots of things.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Oh.
They're right here.
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
Stuttering--
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley!
Who!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stop looking at me.
How did you--?
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
What--
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Excuse me?
You're a stuttering Stanley!
I don't know how else to look--
Stop it!
Like what?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
They used to hang people here.
Yes, Cole?
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Good for you.
J. C. Penny's?
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
Chuck E. who?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
It's our pleasure.
...He doesn't get invited places.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Superstition.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
'Course, it's none of my business.
What are you talking about?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
Meaning?
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
How'd he know I'd come?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
See?
Nope.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Two.. maybe three days.
What's a "little while?"
Could take a little while, though.
Alright!
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
You're standing in horseshit.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Suzie???
Not lately.
Aha. The Lovers.
The band.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
...You any good with those?
...Hi.
Hi.
Which street corner?
I happen to be a professional.
Someone actually... employs you?
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Not according to these.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Bitch.
Bitch.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Tramp.
Witch.
Slut.
Bitch.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Fuck you.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Get off his case sweetie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Carl, what are you doing?
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Come on --
Not someone -- Mac.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
No shit.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Sorry.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
I didn't do anything --
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Looks like the alternator.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Bus broke down.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Book of Jeremiah.
Sounds familiar.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Gene.
I thought you said two hundred.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
-- "Billy-Jean" --
"Peggy-Sue" --
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Hey. Fuck you.
I could. You sucked.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Harvest moonshining!
He means moon shining.
Hi Suze.
"And a slash-slash there --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
"-- an AXE!"
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Metaphysical question, man.
Should we be doing this, dude?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
So... what does it do?
Manure... is life.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Are you crazy?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
You're out of your mind, man.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Curt Cobain.
I --
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Amends...?
It's time to make amends.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
-- It's not me!
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
People say he was a murderer.
Sure. What do you want to know.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
I don't think so.
You'll be back.
"Blood?"
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
I'll be fine here.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
This is his room... isn't it?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
Pardon?
How... was she "called?"
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
You know who I am. You invited me.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
What's wrong?
Ow!
-- By way of my breasts?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Never heard of it.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Not while you're driving.
Throw me one.
He's right. You were behind.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Amen.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
He started it.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Down boy.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
The audience!
Who? Us?!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Chicken sandwich?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Is that right?
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
How does it feel, Keith?
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yes!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Shit!
Never.
I almost thought for a second...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
...no... Mac... p-please...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
No. Not without you --
Get out of here.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Mac... let's get out of here.
Don't look.
No Mac, please... I --
Suzie --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Listen to me --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
No --
It's you. You and your father.
Suzie... No.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You're... limping.
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
What are --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Wait a minute --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Suzie --
You never had trouble communicating before.
You wouldn't understand.
Mmmm -- so can I...
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Getting ready.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
I said that's enough!
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Let it go.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
So?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
What's wrong?
Nah. Just you.
What about Jeremiah?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Then why go back now?
Name something.
About what?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Nothing to tell.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Yeah?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
What'll we do?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Why bother?
Someone better tell Mac.
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Carl.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Where's Mac?
Us? We been... moonlighting.
-- Where have you two been?
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Second verse!
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Like your guitar break.
Like what?
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Spider.
What is it?!!
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
What?
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
How are you going to find him?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
'Mornin', Jack.
Bill, we need to talk!
Shit.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
And this is mine.
It's my nature.
You took Bill.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Okay.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Aspirin.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Yeah. Good.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
No, Starla! No!
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
What?
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
What are you doing?!
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
I'm sorry.
That wasn't a good night, no.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
No reception out here.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Starla, it ain't --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
How about Brenda?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
No. What?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Hey, Grant.
Grant, where'd you go?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Oh, yeah?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Pretty, ain't they?
Just checking out the lights.
What you up to?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Whatcha' doin'?
Sorry.
That's not funny.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Shelby!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
He's a fucking Martian?!
We're coming your way, man!
Where are you?!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What's she see in that douchebag?
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Looks like a chipmunk.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Rorschach.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
What?
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Don't worry, Chief.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Hey there, Chief.
Do it.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Sorry.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Yeah.
Are you nodding?
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby --
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Brought you munchies.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
What?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Shut up.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Who's the lucky fella?
Hell, I was game!
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
All the rib eyes?
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
How many you need?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
What can I do you for?
Sure thing, killer.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Meat.
Grant, you're sick!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, no!
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
I'll get if for you.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Who's that?
You're pretty.
What are you doing?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Okay.
You're my princess, aren't you?
My present?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Welcome home.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
I never danced in a towel before.
Out.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Where are you going?
That's disrespectful.
Flip.
Sure you do.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
It's just a work thing.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
When one sees you they all see you.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
What other stuff?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Margaret.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Praise Jesus.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Where'd he go?
Hey, look!
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Gold--digger, huh?
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Your what?
Get your hands off my daughter!
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
You.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
What do you think?
You got my barley pop?
You paying for the gas?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
How much style?
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
You know how rumors start.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
If...?
What's he get if he wins here?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
See ya, Kate.
See ya, Bandit.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
What are you thinking?
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
Absolutely.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
That man is your father?!?
He's just exhausted.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
What can I say?
Hey...
Well, thanks for the lift.
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
One to five?
Weight Station.
Why are you stopping?
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
What kind of a guy is he?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Bandit II?
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
My very words.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
And?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Ummm?
Kate...
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Yeah?
I'm proud of you.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
How do you know?
An unmarked police car.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Let's hit it.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Mississippi's the other way!
Like what?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
You could've asked.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would've come back for you.
By stealing my car?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You know this guy, don't you?
He's after us again!
What the hell are you doing?!?
Ciao.
See ya, Kate.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Jesus!!!
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Hey...
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Eleven.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
We lost him.
Well?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Shoot.
Can I ask you something?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Anything?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
What the hell's going on?
You just passed your nemesis.
I give up.
Guess what?
Would I lie to you?
Seriously?!?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Where you from?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
You have a great profile.
They're both a challenge.
Driving, talking to me...
Driving?
Is this fun?
Having fun.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Well?...
Okay.
So tell me about yourself.
Eyes on the road.
A what?
An existentialist.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
But you could get killed, right?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Who'd want to?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why're you driving so fast?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Kate McConnell.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
You sure do.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
I'll do it.
But you'll do it?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I'm begging.
Yes.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Why should I?
Another time.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
That's me.
Order up!
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
No what?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
What's your pleasure?
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Yeah, but...
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
What's that, pardner?
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
I'm cucumber cool.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I'm here.
Bandit II?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm all ears.
Let's boogie.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Talk to me.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
-- How we doing?
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
You okay?
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
We'll be waiting. Over.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
I'll believe it when I see it.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
We're outta motion lotion.
Now what?
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Never mind. It's nothing.
Bandit?
We're gone.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Then don't.
I hate to say it...
I ran into complications.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I'm at marker eight-five.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
What's your twenty?
Do I have a choice?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
Yeah, guy?
Bandit?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
What does the old Timex say?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Not for long, you ain't.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What's your twenty?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit I, come back.
Bandit I, do you copy?
Clear and rolling.
Save it. We got a long haul.
I hate to say I told you so.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
We still on schedule?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Let's get the hell outta here.
They're jammed!
Hit the brakes!
Can a pig whistle?
You know how to drive one of these things?
Redneck heaven.
Liquid gold.
Let's keep it that way.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Shit! No one's here.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
He's history.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Loud and clear.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Why are we doing this?
Yeah?
Bandit?
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Six. Got it.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Go.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Running blocker.
What are you doin' now?
But I still don't think...
Also boring.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
How long's this gonna take?
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
See.
No.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Waynette!
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Or in the slammer.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
How'd you know?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
No.
Cledus.
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Go head on, breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Go breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.
About one to five years worth.
Have any trouble getting here?
He's thirsty.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
I think you're just yellow.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Bandit two, you read me?
How's your twenty?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
What's he...
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Who's Fred?
Shut up, Fred.
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
Where the hell are you?
This is Bandit I. Over.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Chickenshit money.
Five thou.
Yes, sir.
Now, you just find him, son.
Oh.
That's the point, Dickey.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Then it must be a helluva idea.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
And who has access to that floor?
Of course. Yes.
Is your security team armed?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
You have a butler working that floor?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
What kind of personnel?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
-- so you shut them off?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
That's correct.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Yeah.
No.
Mortal.
How bad?
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Maroon uniforms?
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
What about the sheriff's task force?
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
He's giving them up?
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
And a very bad gamble.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Maybe.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Anything on the Swede?
And that didn't seem odd to you?
Yeah.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
You're sure?
Uh, yeah.
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Who?
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Did he give you his name?
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Two of 'em?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
But there were more of you?
Mmm-hmm.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Pretty much, yep.
And threw us into the lake.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
Ww... uh...
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
You think so?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Man, that's great.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Really?
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Damn... alright then.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
You woulda?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
...I forgive you Darwin.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I'm here, where's the car?
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
That's not possible. I told you.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
I'm not doing cocaine.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
...About what?
I've got concerns.
Yeah, why.
Are you on a land line?
Then what --
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
Your attitude sucks.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
Yeah, we've been through that.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
So I guess you're not going.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
What happened?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
Without peer?
I am. Yeah.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
...I'm sorry...
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I did it?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I could have it sent out...
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Look at the collar on that coat...
About what?
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Okay.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
I left him a message.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I said I got his machine.
What'd you say?
I got his machine.
D'you talk to'm?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
FUCK YOU!
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
That's probably him now...
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
I don't see it like that at all.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
No... We're trying to save Heller.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
I wouldn't go that far.
...So you made another deal?
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...Yeah, fifty-three.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
...Are you insane?
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...When did you know all this?
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...He does now...
...Does he know?
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
You're finished.
-- You can and you will.
I can't discuss --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- will be handled back in --
My debrief --
What are you doing here?
Where's Israel?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Here. Sit.   Please.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
It's the last place they'd look.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
I thought Heller was a double op?
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
It's gettin' done Sid.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
I'm working on it.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
How are we on time...?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
So how we lookin'?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Yeah... Sid?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
None whatsoever.
No shit.
A million flat.
Shoot.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Yeah, I can front this.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Wow.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
... Jesus... what for?
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
-- okay, g'head --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
I'm here.
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
You got clicks, anything?
Yeah... Sid?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What were you doin' here anyway?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
That takes some of the sting out.
Like a mafucka.
True?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
For real?
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Got hit twice.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
You love her?
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
-- never in a million girl --
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
I DON'T KNOW!
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
...What are they doin' right now...?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
What?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
Security's locking down the elevators.
What's wrong?
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What'd you say?
Fuck you.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What!?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
A Fed? Like FBI?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Why?
What are we talkin' on the split...
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
What's the time frame?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
What else did Padiche say?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
Bulllllshit...
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
A puppet.
No?  Who am I, then?
You're not Gibarian...
You'll end up like me.
I can trust Rheya.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
Can it work?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
What do you want?
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Leave the light off.
Gibarian.
Yes.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
How quickly?
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Whose side are you on?
You fucking bastard...
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Why would you let her to do that?
No, she won't.
She'll come back.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
You murdered her!
Not her.  It.
You killed her!
Why did you agree to come here?
That's fantastic.
Yes.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Listen --
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Where's his body?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
I want to hear your version.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
What happened to Gibarian?
All right.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
Maybe you can.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Jesus...
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
When did this happen?
I won't be making the trip.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
I love her.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Into what?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
Her oxygen would have run out.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Yes.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Just get him to stop.
What plan?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
What do you want?
No.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
Get out --
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She drank liquid oxygen.
What happened?
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
They come when you sleep.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
Human beings can die.
Perhaps it did.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
No.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Who are you trying to convince?
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Not necessarily.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
Why?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
What is it?
Kelvin, you awake?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
I don't know.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
To who?
What will you say?
Told you what?
I wish you'd told me.
Probably.
Will she come back?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Rheya.
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Dead?
My wife.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
And professionally?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
What was it?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Shut up.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
That depends.
How long can you go without sleep?
How much sleep?
How much sleep do you need?
Oh, that's a relief.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Who was it?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Why, who did you see?
Is there anybody else here?
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
He'll let me in.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Where's Sartorius?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
What?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
How?
He's dead.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
How can you be here...
You must have been dreaming.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
When?
Where did you go before?
Please.  Don't.
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
What does it want?
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
What are you taking?
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
Am I really her?
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
I can't --
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
I think they help.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I wish you wouldn't.
I want to stop taking those pills.
Is that really what you want?
But then I would be dead now.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Yes, you are --
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Who are you, then?
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
You're lying.
I want you here.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Then you won't make it.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I can't stay here.
Chris --
I never said I didn't.
You never said you wanted one.
Neither did I.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Thank you.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You should have told me.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
I want every second I can get with you.
Then you'll die.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
No.
I'm disgusting.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't call me that.
Rheya --
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
I love you.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
It's all right.
What's happening to us?
He is.  But he was here...
You said he was dead.
Gibarian.  He was here.
What's wrong?
If you're here.
Do you?
Do you want to stay here?
Not this time.
But that's what happened before.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Rheya.
You don't want me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
You're the coward.
Those are dreams.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Can you sleep?
I love you, too.
No.  I love you.
Was she right?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Why did she do it?
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
But we fought.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
When?  When I'm asleep?
Sartorius.
Who have you been talking to?
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
What are you talking about?
Stop.
You don't love me.
What's wrong.
I'm glad.
Yes.  Yes.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
He has a point.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
What does Snow think you should do?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
I like that too.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
I think so.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Why did you say those things?
You don't know?
What happened to us, exactly?
I did too.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
What kind of look?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
How old were you?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
Where've you been?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What happened?
As I said, then it's God, right?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You still don't believe in God?
It's something.
Then it's God, right?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Is it intelligent?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
Is it a planet?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
What do you mean?
What do you remember?
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
You're better when you take them.
You talk like an actor.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
You go home.
Let's go home.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Rheya.  Not here.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Stop it.
You want to fuck her?
Better.
And tonight?
I wasn't.
You didn't look very happy.
Not a very happy poem.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
Book?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
I want you inside me right now.
Rheya...
Yes.
We're taking a flight?
To calm my anxiety.
To calm your anxiety.
What are they?
I'll be right back.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Why?
Don't.
I'll just be a minute.
I'll go with you.
I need to see Snow.
Yes.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
You want it coming back with us?
Fuck me.  I knew it.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
I'm not Snow.
Snow, get up here, now.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
It's an experiment.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
We want to talk freely.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
He won't.
Why do you say that?
He won't do it.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Occasionally.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
It's terrific Win.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Looks a little constipated to me.
You didn't like him?
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Hello, Win.
Claire!
You take care.
Say goodbye, Mike.
I do.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I like your coat.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
You don't have to, now.
I don't know...
You still going away?
So.
So.
Yeah.  It's all over.
Everyone's all right...?
Mike...?
Claire!
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
... Mike.
Yeah...
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
"To"... Forget about you.
"For"...?
Long enough.
How long you going away for?
... Don't explain.
I'd miss my life...
I know.
It wouldn't work.
I know.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Yeah.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Let's do it.
Pretty bad.
Do you?
Do you dance?
What a memory.
I'll think about Wednesday.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Claire...
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
When can I see you?
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Where?
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Oh that thing in Queens.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Are you okay?
Oh God, that's great!
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
You don't want to know.
I don't know.
What do you want to do?
Not exactly.
You told her?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
I don't know you...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
They called here after you left...
Yeah.
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
I do care about you!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Stop being nuts!
Let go!
Stop, will you?!
Claire...!
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Claire, will you calm down?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
You put me life in danger.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
I can't open it.
Open the door, will you?
What do you want?
Claire?
Sleep good.
Good night, Mike.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I'll miss you, Mike...
You could do better.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
You asked.
Tell it like it is.
What's to like?
You don't like him, do you?
What about Neil?
Very nice.
But "nice".
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Yeah.
And "is"...?
Yeah.  It was.
So it was "love".
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Absolutely.  Look at this.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Could be, I guess.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
No kidding.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
They're kind of fuzzy.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
How did you know?
You were reading my Renoir.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Yeah, what a woman.
Urdu and Hindi.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Hmm...
Claire?
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Big talk... Desperate guy.
He said he'd kill me.
Sooner, the better.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
Listen, that was my fault.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Yeah.
You all right?
I came on at 8:00.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
I'll come with you.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Let's get a drink.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Not too sure about that.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I got money.
Put it on my account, please.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Beg pardon?
Would you pick one out, please?
No, Ma'am.
Are you nervous?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
Queens... You know Queens?
You live in Manhattan?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
What did he say?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
There's a phone in the car.
I'm supposed to call in.
Can we go then?
Right.  That's true.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Uh...
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Hi.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Straight ahead.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Not if you don't want me to.
You're planning to speak?
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Claire...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
And I'm making mine.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Claire...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... I don't want to talk about it...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
I'm all right.
Tommy...!
Absolutely.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
I don't know Tommy.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Sure we are, let's go!
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
Nothing.
Keep what handy?
Me neither.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I'm all right.
Ellie...
No.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
What about Tommy?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
Let me drive...
What's the difference?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
You talked to his wife?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What did you watch?
I watched TV.
What did you do tonight?
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I'm sorry.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
What're you talking about --
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You heard me.
What was that?
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Did you hear what I said?!!
Did you hear what I said?
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
Mike, take it easy...
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
What?
I'll be right up.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Coming to bed?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Why?
She bought it.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
She took you shopping for a tie?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What did she say the down payment was?
It's not your taste.
Bought it.
Where'd you get the tie?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
I might stop you.
I'd identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Why?
She's got to identify him.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Honey.  You got him.
You don't want to hear about it.
What shit, honey?
Oh, some shit.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Okay?
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Hey.  The neighbors.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I can still use a gun.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
For how long?
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
So how'd it go?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
You got no idea...
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Get in bed.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What are you talking about?
My ass is falling.  It is.
Your what...?
My ass if falling.
What?
Mike?
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Too kinky.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
It should've been me...
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
I heard.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
What about when she identifies him?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Even Joey Venza?!
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
What about when she goes out?
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
I just sat and listened.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
No, I need'm now!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Call a cruiser!
At my house...!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Wasn't your fault.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
Not Koontz.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
You in this with me?
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Who's Joey Venza?
Right behind you, T.J.
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
... Hard?
Does it make you... hard?
Yes.
Ever shot anyone?
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
You're here 'til what time?
I don't really see what that has to do with...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
No, I will not step outside.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Is she injured?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I asked for the man in charge...
No, sir...
Are you in charge here?
What the fuck you doin'?!
Watch your step!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Under the table.
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Let my kid go.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Why should she come in?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
How do I know that's her?
I'll prove it!
Hold it...!
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
You should'a brought the girl.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Take care, pal.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Shooting?
Shooting.
So, what are you doing tonight?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
You coming in?
We're gonna pass the street.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
She's what?
She's taking singing lessons.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
Mom and I got plans.
How about dinner tonight?
Okay, I guess.
How are things going, pal?
Yeah, I think so.
Nice threads Dad.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Lay back, Mack.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
I know where everything is.
How do you know where the gun is?
Scrambled eggs surprise?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
What're we having?
Let me see.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Be nice.
And Flash isn't?
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Sexual tension...
I'm always here, Pete.
I know.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
No, no.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Oh, sure.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Remember Little League?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Nonot really.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
You stop him?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
No. No, that's okay.
What, want a glass?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Here you go, Pete.
Or was it all a dream?
See?
I was there.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Flash, drop it--
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Flash, get lost.
Hm.  What a lump.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
I'm parked illegally!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Lizzy!
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
I got you a present.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
You get mugged or something?
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Mm-hmm.
Jesus Christ.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
Don't be pitiful.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
I know.  I've got one too.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Harry
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Harry!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
What's in there?
They'll never take me alive.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Right.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
How are you doing, kid?
Get away from me, freak!
Are you okay?
That's not even close.
Lemme down, bugface!
Now tell me you love me.
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Mr. Jameson--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Can't focus...
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Can we make it a hundred?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Yeah--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Hmf-hrr?
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Fine.
Frmpph-yrr.
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Would you cool it already?
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
You're making my life difficult.
How about tomorrow?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
A spider.  Eight legs.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Are you quite finished?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Well...
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Thanks, I already ate.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Just call me Spidey.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
What if the world ends tomorrow?
What if you get hurt?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Even if they're not clever.
Some things you should say anyway.
He knew.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Nah.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Why?
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Hello, Liz.
I'm here...
Peter?
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Strong...
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I know what you mean.  I...
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
You'd feel what?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Well, no.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
I think I'd like that.
Do you mind if I come too?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
I've got no problems.
What's your problem?
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Hi, Adele.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
I've gotta study.
What are you doing this weekend?
Hurry up, Flash!
I'd never admit that.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Does it have a human name?
Some prep school thing.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
You should write that one down.
But you like that in a man?
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
What?
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I suppose.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
My my.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Thank God.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
I hate--
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Uh is a good start.
I-- uh--
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Huh?
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
It's too early to be clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Good morning, Liz.
Precise equipment such as waldos
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Any sign of our friend?
Yeah, Roz.
Peter-- my condolences.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Of course.
I know him.
You sure about all this?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Toxic dumps, huh.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Waldos.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
So you've found Thorkel?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
How is he?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Aunt May, what happened?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Peter, you're bleeding.
See?  You big dullard.
A match made in heaven.
Use a fork.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Absolutely no class.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
What the hell is that?
It'll shut itself off.
The record--
No.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It's Friday night...
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
I'm a photographer, remember?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'll introduce you.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I am old enough to--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
That's the understatement of the year.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Poison emergency.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I will finish what I've begun
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
No!
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I don't care.  Cretin.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Let's talk in the hall.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
No. It isn't.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Creation? Or its opposite?
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
I left a paper in my desk.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
I'll try. Thanks.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Need any more help?
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
How much do you know about it?
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Really, Professor, I--
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Your dog ate it.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Peter, what can I do for you?
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Mr. Parker.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
No
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
What?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
So they're airing this tonight?
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Like it?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
No, no!  Not there!
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
I'm not so happy myself.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Phooey on that.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Do you... live around here?
Just drop me off here.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Bonkers.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Imagine how I feel.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
You're sure you're all right.
Right.  Let's go.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
We did not.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Plenty.
What's wrong with him?
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
They never caught on.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Jawohl!
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl.
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
What's the match gag?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Any news on Dunbar?
We made a deal with Barrack One.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Get going on the trap door.
Coming up.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
Okay. Move on.
Roger.
Ready?
Static!
Come on!
Looks good outside.
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
So long, Sefton.
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Yeah. Security.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Who is it?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Who is it?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
In this barracks?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
I don't know anymore.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
We'll get some more.
There's only one pair left.
That'll do.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
Forget it.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
We're looking at it.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Thanks.
Have a cigar.
Why not?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Take it.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
You make my mouth water.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
A little something what?
And maybe a little something else?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
That's right.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
You stink, Sefton!
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Private property, bub.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Then we're all in on it?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
How did he get over there?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Break it off!
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Come again?
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
I'll call the whole pot.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
You are talking crazy!
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Which one of you is what?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Don't wear it out!
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Let's!
Let's blow, Chauncey.
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
What are the chances busting out of here?
You won't get off that cheap.
It's on me.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Yeah.
What some brandy?
Not you.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Sefton!
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
My legs are frozen.
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
Twenty-five.
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
You are being rude again.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Abfuehren!
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I'll live.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
105-353.
What is your number?
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Isn't it?
Interesting.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
You were saying --?
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
What exactly is he charged with?
It is.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
And this?
It's a mouse trap.
What is this? This is water?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
You should live so long.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Some are not bad at all.
Jawohl!
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Then droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl?
Say, Schulz --
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
No. I want to draw.
You want to go?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Betty! Betty!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Why, sure!
May I have this dance, Miss?
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
It's that song, Harry!
You're crying, Animal.
Let me alone.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
I'll open mine, too.
I'll open mine now.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Do Grable.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Grable, not Gable!
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
You hold him. I'll slug him.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
It's not good for you, Animal.
That's what I wanna hear.
What do they always say?
What do those broads say?
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
Harry -- I'm blind!
Bombs away!
She'll never forgive me!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
You did?
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
You'll fix me up!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
So what? There's other women!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
He's the grrrrreatest!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Where'd that come from?
Easy, Animal! Easy!
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
No?
No, Animal.
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
You're teasing me again!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Me? What if she don't want me?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
What's the award?
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
Betty Grable!
Let me go!
You want Betty Grable!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Let me go! Let me go!
Lay off! The blonde is mine!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Stop it, Harry!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Shut up, Animal!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Yes, sir.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
You have a Lieutenant here...
Yes, sir.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Anything else?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Why the south latrine?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Any objections, men?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
We've all done a poor job of it.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
What about Schulz?
Good.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
What are you going to do?
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Not yet.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
What radio?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Check.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
You could use a new one yourself.
Shoot!
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
What's the decoy?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
You taking Dunbar?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
What are we going to do with him?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Go on.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
You off your rocker?
You did!
Who did?
You told them, Hoffy.
How do they know?
I called it the last time, didn't I?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
Anybody cover?
You starting that again?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Okay, Price. You stay.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Right.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You heard that, Sefton?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
We did it.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
Borscht?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Lay off, Sefton.
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Says me.
Says who?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Are we boring you?
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
A little weak today.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Anybody call?
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Oh.
Give this to Joey, will you?
Yeah?
Just what makes you so popular?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
The what?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
What time?
December seventh, forty-one.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
I'll kill you for that!
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
What did you say?
Ach so!
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Are you questioning me?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Thirty-fifth.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
What about the radio?
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ich weiss alles.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
We have no radio.
Give me the radio.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Which one of us is the informer?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Not particularly.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
How many do you want? A thousand?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
No! No!
I'll make it five hundred!
Yes, you do!
I do not want those cigarettes.
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
What guy?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Here. Take them.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Fine -- fine!
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Good morning, Sefton.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
That is my wife.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
This is me in Cincinnati.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Russian women prisoners?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
You heard him.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Have a nice time over there?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Just don't drool on it.
Is it all right if we smell it?
A chicken?
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Full disruptors.
Target their Bridge.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Where is he now?
Then when is he going to Engineering?
He is.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Where is he?
It's working.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
HoS qorDu. 
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
Twelve years, sir.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Captain=8A
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
Commander.
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Population?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Are any of them inhabited?
And destroy every planet in the system.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
That's where he's going.
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
I believe so.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Can you project its course?
This is its current position.
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
What do you mean?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Data, are you all right?
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
Data?
When is it expected back?
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
One minute to warp core breach.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
Data, are you all right?
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
Data, this isn't the time.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Thanks.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
What?
You get what?
I get it. I get it.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
Really? What do you feel?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Well?
Agreed.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
Is she still angry?
All hands, brace for impact!
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
I hope so, sir.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
The station complement was nineteen.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
We're within range, sir.
On screen.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Can you locate them?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
I don't understand.
Yes, where would you go?
Can I?
Why would you want to leave?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
These are my children...my children.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Where is he now?
All of us.
Soran?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Left behind?
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
This is the Nexus?
You're in the Nexus.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
What happened to you?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
What's the "Nexus"?
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Do you remember him?
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
We don't have a tractor beam.
Please, I insist.
No, no. Thank you.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
Oh, of course.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Please, please.
Well, may we have a look around?
It's our pleasure.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Yes.  Thank you.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
You could say that.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
That's right.
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
I hadn't planned on it.
Close to retirement?
That's right.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Antonia?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
Better?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Yes, yes, it is.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
Kirk here.
I always do.
Keep her together until I get back.
Where are the deflector relays?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Aye.
A photon torpedo?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I thought you might.
But I do have a theory...
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Phasing? To where?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
And what would that be, sir?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
Oh
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
No, I didn't know that.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
No.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
What do you want?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
What's normal?
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Maybe they're not out there.
How is that possible?
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Report.
No. Thank you.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Understood. That will be all.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Thank you, Number One.
No, sir.
Is there a problem?
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Make it so.
Sir?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Captain, are you all right?
Thank you.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
The Nexus.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
The thought had crossed my mind.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Doctor Soran?
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Aye, sir.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Lock phasers and return fire!
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Aye, sir.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Trilithium?
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
There are no other ships in the system.
It looks like we're too late.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
The royal...studs?
Execute!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Tractor beam, aye!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Status!
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Scotty...?
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
What did you see, Chekov?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Still no response, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Aye, sir.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Nothing. As before.
Response?
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Will we get another ship?
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov -- ?
On screen.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Locate.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Aye sir, coding now.
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Not from here, no.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Why don't we beam it up?
What is it?
I don't believe it...
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Could it be Spock's?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
David, I don't understand...
I went wrong.
David!... What went wrong?
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
David... Sorry I'm late.
Hello, sir. It's David.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
I'll go...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I still don't...
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I don't understand.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
... How long?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
This planet is aging in surges.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
Did your collaborator know?
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Why?
Not exactly.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I have already made one transmission too many...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
That may be difficult...
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Logic indicates that is the case.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Later. Let's go...
Spock's burial robe.
What is it?
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
David --
.          .. Spock's tube...
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
My readings indicate great instability.
I'll handle that later.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Short range scan.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
A photon tube...!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Underground deposit?
Same sector. Metallic mass.
It's a little early to celebrate.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
... Fascinating.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Captain, what's happening?!
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
None that I can detect, sir.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Do you have an explanation?
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
You said there wouldn't be any.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Just him, sir!
How many more?
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
What's wrong?
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Good shooting, Scotty.
Aye, sir!
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Aye, sir!
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Sir...?
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Mr. Scott?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Mr. Scott...
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Much is at stake...
My God...
. He will remain always as he is.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
What? What are you saying?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Goodbye, David.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
What happened...?
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
The ship... Out of danger...?
Yes, yes, Spock...
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Why would you do this...?
You would have done the same for me.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Yes. And I know you.
I know you... Do I not?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Go, Sulu!
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Come on!
Close... There --
What about surface life signs...?
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
With some on the planet...
About a dozen officers and men.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
... A cloaking device?
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
See! That shimmering area.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Count on our help, sir.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
The word, sir?
She's to be decommissioned.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Would you look at that?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
No, sir, no response.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Any time.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Yours...?!
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
May I ask why...?
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Genesis?! Whatever for?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Indisposed, sir.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Welcome home, Jim.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!

Give me your hand and we both live.
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Genesis, I want it.
Because you wish it.  
But, why?
No.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!

Wait! Give me a chance --
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
David?... David!
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Torpedoes coming in -- !

Report status!
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
What I have done, I had to do.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
What about Spock?
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
What you ask is difficult.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What must I do?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Bones!...
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
Yes... But -- how...?
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... Spock...
... Or the one.
... The needs of the few...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
Yes...
... He spoke of your friendship.
Of course...!
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Then, how --
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
But -- why?
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Yes, I was...
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
I -- saw no future --
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
How can you tell that?
They know we would die first.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I ordered no interruptions.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Sir, may I suggest --
Station!
Success, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Understood, my lord.
Share this with no one.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
So!  Speak!
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Sir, may I --
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
My Lord... what are your orders?
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

500 Kellicams!
Wait!... Wait...
1,000 Kellicams, closing!

Firing range, sir.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Yes, my lord!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
All true.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Good for you, Lieutenant.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
How is that...?
You amaze me, Commander.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
You're not going in there -- !
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Until now.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Now that's what I call a meal.
Our first order of business is survival.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
They even killed the galley chief.
I can spare me...
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Khan could be down there!
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
It never rains but when it pours --
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Ah.
Shore leave, Admiral.
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
From yourself, Admiral.
And who am I hiding from?
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Thank you.
Say thank you.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Uh -- what are they?
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
I'm not a drama critic.
That's all you have to say?
Physician, heal thyself.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
I have my orders.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
I still don't under --
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
Is that a poem?
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
You did this -- in a day?!
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Wait --
Jim please --
Carol!
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
David. Please.
But we can't just sit here -- !
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
So are we, it looks like.
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
Jim --
Mother, go back!
David --
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
Who --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Does that about do it?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
Maybe...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
I know, I know...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
What do you want with us? I demand --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Never mind! Hurry!
But the child --
What's the matter -- ?
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Ssssh!
I told you! I told you I saw a --
There's an air-lock.
I saw it -- !
You're crazy -- !
I can hardly see --
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You know what she'll say...
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Don't tell me you've got something.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
Well done, Commander.
I see. Helmsman?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Is that what you came here to say?
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
I am truly sorry.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I'm trying, David.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
It was just words.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
I didn't expect anything.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
Are you running away from me?
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
I don't mean to intrude.
You can't!
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
We encoded four minutes --
How soon --
He's on a build up to detonation!
What?
It's the Genesis Wave!
We appear to have plenty of time.
It's a long story.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
Where's Dr. Marcus --
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
I don't know.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Oh, I believe it.
Don't you believe it.
The Admiral's son.
What are you looking at?
Only half of you would get there.
Let go -- he can't -- !
I shall avenge you --
Yours... is... the superior...
Raise the shields...
Inoperative.
Tactical!
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Rake her.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Visual --
Departing dark side, Regula.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Well?
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
No!
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
They won't --
Raise them --
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
Locking phasers on target.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
They're still running with shields down.
Let them eat static.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
KHAN!
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Perhaps I no longer need to try.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Time's up, Admiral...
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Thirty seconds...
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Genesis, what's that?
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Listen to me -- you men and women --
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Chekov, who is this man?
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
I'm going down to the station.
Just barely, sir.
A few shots, sir.
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Scotty -- what's left?
Aye, sir --
We'll be going to warp speed --
Aye, sir.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Sensors, Captain?
... No response, sir.
Do it, while we have time.
Admiral --
On screen.
Scotty, let's have it.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Spock?
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Try the emergency channels...
She's not responding...
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Uhura. Can't you augment?
He'll die -- !
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
<u>WHY</u>?
Aye, sir.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Give the word, Admiral.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Not at present.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Yes, Spock.
Admiral, this is Spock.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Aye...
The word is given: warp speed.
Is the word given?
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
Yes, SIR.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
And who is this?
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
Spock...!
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Or the one.
... the good of the few...
Yes --
The ship -- out of danger?
Spock!
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Uhura, patch me in --
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Steady as you go...
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Best speed, Scotty...
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Scotty, can we make it inside?
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Uh oh.
Best we could do in two hours.
That's it?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
What IS working around here?
Be careful, Jim...
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Aye sir --
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
A distinct possibility.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Affirmative, Admiral.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
It's all we've got.
The prefix code?
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Not enough against their shields.
Too late --
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
They knew just where to hit us.
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
It would explain a great many things --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
What's she doing here?
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Gentlemen, this isn't --
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
The power of creation --
It literally is Genesis...
Yes.
Carol Marcus --
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
How far?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
Or the one.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
I would not presume to debate you.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
To be sure, Captain.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Home.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
I am understandably curious.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Yes, sir.
In my quarters, Uhura.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Kirk here.
Aye, sir --
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Admiral on the bridge!
Dismiss the company.
Understood, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Aye, sir.
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Distance from Reliant...
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Time!
Engine room! What's happening?!
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time from my mark...
Aye, sir.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Power levels quite low, sir.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
All stop, sir.
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
At what.
Hold your course. Look sharp...
They just don't want us going in there.
That was close --
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
<u>WHAT</u>?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
How?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
Admiral?
Stage Two of what?
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
Erased...
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Indeterminate life signs.
There is no such regulation.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
On screen...
HURRY.
Reliant's command...
Who?
Khan!
Energize defense fields.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Take the test again.
Yes.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
That was a little joke.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
I failed to resolve the situation.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I did not think so.
You earned it.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
May I speak, sir?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
... No, sir. It has not.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
Because... there was no way to win.
And why not?
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Very well.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Battle stations.
Admiral on the bridge --
Try again.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Sir, you did it.
Phasers locked...
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Scotty!
I can't get power, sir!
Trying, sir!
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Visual.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Engage warp engines --
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Stop engines.
Stop engines.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
I really must thank you.
Honors -- hup!
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Ready, sir.
Prepare for warp speed.
Course heading, Captain?
We are clear and free to navigate.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
I'll try, Captain.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Shields activated!
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Aye, Captain.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
I exaggerated.
You lied.
By the book...
Certainly...
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Aye, sir.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Never, sir.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Aye, sir.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
He's very human.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's not what I expected, Sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Fire all phasers...!
... They do, indeed.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I do this because I was there,
You do this -- for friendship?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Where must you go?
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
The question is irrelevant.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
I do not understand the final question...
Gillian --
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Why don't I?
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Yeah.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Fine. Just fine.
How're you doing?
Just a couple of kooks...
Heard there was some excitement.
A moment alone, please.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Please...
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Come on, Pavel...
Wake up, man, wake up!
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
An experimental device, doctor.
Cramps.
What did you say she was getting?
What do you think, Spock?
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Oh, joy.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
It doesn't look all that different.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
That's crazy!
-- That's the general idea.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
We've done it before.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Now wait just a damn minute.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Bones, stay here.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Bones --
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
It'll come back to him.
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
What do you mean?
You sure this is such a bright idea?
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
It is.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
... I don't think he understands...
Well nobody's perfect...
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
... Best shot...?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Then how.?
That is what I said, Doctor.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
... My God...
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
I liked him better before he died.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You're joking...!
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
... My shoes...
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Hi... Busy?
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Fundoscopic examination --
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Reading the patient's vital signs.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I was not informed about observers.
We're just -- observing.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Damage report!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Can you isolate the wave?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
What's causing that!?
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
How long?
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Find it?
I'm wery sorry, but --
Go ahead. Stun me.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
I am? May I go now?
You play games with me and you're through
I do not know your name.
No, <u>my</u> name.
My name?
Name?
The top of what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
Like what?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Understood. What is your plan?
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Yes, sir.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
No choice now, Scotty!
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Shields, aye.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
We are launching everything we have.
Can you protect us?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
"Neutralized?" How?
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Status report, Admiral!
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
You sure you won't change your mind?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
I was not.
So you were at Berkeley.
The hell they did.
I suppose they told you that...?
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Why does it have to be goodbye?
You mean this is -- goodbye?
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
... You have a point...
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
... What does that mean?
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Oh my God, we're too late!
You need me.
You tricked me.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
A spaceship with a missing man.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
... Damn!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Gone?!
Kirk. They're gone.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
But Kirk...
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Steady, now. We need your help.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
It's true... what you said...
Right.
Here... In the park?
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
So. There we are.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Noon tomorrow...?!
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
You want the details?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
I'm all ears.
All right. The truth?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Who do you think I am?
... Who are you?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Wanna try it from the top?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
What's what?
What's that?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
What do you mean now?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Hm?
Where could you take them?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Thanks. Cheers.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
How will that be done, exactly?
... You're very perceptive.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Just lucky, I guess.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
Implicitly.
Do you trust me?
It's his way.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Or believe, I'll bet.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Then --
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
Go ahead.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Iowa.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Memory problems, too.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Thanks.
You've already been that. C'mon.
We don't want to be any trouble.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
I buy that. What about him?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Back to San Francisco.
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
How soon?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Why's that?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
You mean man...
I will, Admiral.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Spock: Condition report!
Then... Where the hell are we?
They did, Admiral.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Right.  Will you help us?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Thank you, Spock.
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
The tank will be finished by morning...
Status?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
I meant --
How will playing cards help?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
... I see.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
The hell I can't
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
Exaggerate.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
I cannot tell a lie.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
I see.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
Why not?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Yes?
Spock...
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Ah... The giants.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
For example?
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Yes.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
... Simple logic.
How do you know this...?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
But you said toxic.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Explain.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
I have.
You've programmed that from memory...?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
What are the variables...?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Surely you can be more specific...
The late 20th Century.
What is our target in time?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
In progress, Admiral.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
Whales?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Spock...?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Where are you going?!
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Thank you, Admiral.
Permission granted.
Permission to come aboard.
Aye, sir!
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Picture, Uhura!
I have no control, sir!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
10 seconds, sir!
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Three-one-zero, aye!
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Ready sir.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Aye, sir. Descending.
Picture, please.
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
What is our condition?
... Aye sir...?
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Steady as she goes...
Warp two... three...
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Weapons systems?
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
On screen.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Put them on screen!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Bearing!
Mercy Hospital.
Uhura!... Where!
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Any luck...?
Everyone remember where we parked.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
On speakers.
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Yes, sir.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
On screen!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
What is it?
Mr. Sulu?
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Systems report.  Communications?
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
The explosive override -- ?
No power to the bay doors.
The whales...?!
On my way...!
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Full power, sir.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
I'll have to re-energize.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Admiral! There be whales here!
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
How long, Scotty?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Mr. Sulu?
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Two?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Humpbacked - people.?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
You will be in good hands here.
I am well, Admiral.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Do you have the right to murder?
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
That's the ticket, laddie.
Transparent aluminum?
The keyboard... How quaint.
Just use the keyboard...
Hello? Computer...?
... Are you joking?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
... Yes?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Of course.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Well, that's different.
With pleasure.
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Millions?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Right on. You fly?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Hi.
Tell her I feel fine...
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
They are my friends.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
Most kind, Father.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Father...?
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Sulu Hikaru.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I'll be here.
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
This way!
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
What's the rush?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
Jak'tahla?
We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
There are caves in those mountains.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
For someone so young.
... an offlander?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
A perfect moment?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Will it?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
There are days.
But not you.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
Don't panic...
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
Deceive us?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Why?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
You have warp capability?
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
